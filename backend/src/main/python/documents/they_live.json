Never a bad thing in a big(gish) budget B-Movie, in fact in a lot of ways it's more of a B-Movie parody!\rIt's not a perfect film by any means. Carpenter's direction can get very distracting, the soundtrack is a 'love it or hate it' mash up of electronica and thumping basslines, the acting varies wildly in quality, and the pacing lurches from slow, to fast, then back to slow.\r However, for all its flaws, it IS a fantastic movie. Criminally slated back in 1988, it's now a definitive 80's cult classic, watched as a rite of passage by teenagers everywhere!\r If you're someone who missed it as a teenager, then find a copy and settle in for some serious fun and action."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Characterized as an allegory for Jewish control of the media by neo-nazis, it is borderline comical to see how such great art has been misinterpreted. Guess that is what happens to those of us who are a few cards away from a full deck. As it stands, the film is truly just an inventive alien invasion flick that doubles as a social critique for how people sit back and do not question what they are told. This, again, is a problem that continues to today where people simply read or hear something and take it as the gospel truth because the person is on the news or sounds like they know what they are saying. They Live is a cautionary tale in this regard as people have been lulled into believing they are safe when, in reality, we are blind to the negative forces all around us that corrupt our minds. In John Carpenter's incredibly inventive and imaginative They Live, those negative forces are aliens.Unaware of what is going on until he puts on some special sunglasses, John Nada (Roddy Piper) quickly sets out to help the resistance expose the control the aliens have achieved. Through cool gadgets such as those sunglasses of the aliens' watches, the film creates some great little science fiction touches that really only add to the experience. In particular, the former creates incredible anxiety. As John gets surrounded by aliens that know he can see, the film takes on an incredibly thrilling and terrifying tone. However, the same can be said for when he has the glasses off. Whenever he is in a tough situation and Carpenter does not immediately have him put on the glasses, the film is packed with tension and paranoia. The film manages to convince you that everybody and anybody could be an alien, especially when he lacks the glasses. When he loses them, the tension and anxiety to put them back on is felt by the audience as our heart races along with John's.Action-wise, the film is incredibly strong. Each action set piece is incredibly strong and Carpenter knows his way around a gun battle. This is very much the case in They Live in which his battles are very similar to ones found in the very beginning of his career, except with more polish and better effects. On that note, the visual effects are very good. The film does a great job crafting the look the aliens and it feels like it is very similar in style in that area to Tim Burton's Mars Attacks!. However, it feels realistic and looks funny at the very least. Carpenter plays on this at the end when the aliens are revealed in bars, having sex, or on television. While comical in look and feel, the aliens do look pretty interesting and feel authentic and an interesting take on what aliens would like and do on earth.They Live could also be categorized as Carpenter being very tongue-in-cheek with his fighting against criticisms towards his use of sex and violence. The ending highlights this with an alien on television saying that he and George Romero need to tone down both. Here, Carpenter essentially compares his critics to being mindless robotic aliens, incapable of formulating their own opinions. Instead, they opt to parrot what they have heard others say. This is unfortunately still prevalent today, especially in film criticism when a popular film or artist's reputation is quickly torn apart after one critic or person makes a short-sighted argument, which then gains steam and popularity. Carpenter had obviously been critiqued for both sex and violence, so he answers with a film built on testosterone and campy violence and action. Honestly, it is admirable to see him fight back in this fashion.They Live is a truly entertaining and campy science fiction horror comedy about a man who wakes up to alien invasion taking place on Earth. While silly, its science fiction pieces are imaginative and truly engaging. It creates a world that is worthy of further looks and is truly fun to imagine the possibilities within this world, especially with the cool knick knacks introduced by Carpenter throughout the film. Action-packed, inventive, and simply a good time, They Live is another top-notch film from John Carpenter."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Another 'rassler takes a try at acting on the big screen.  The thing is, 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper actually plays the role, rather than injecting his wrestling persona into the character (unlike other wrestlers-turned-movie-actors).  I find this movie very watchable.  For one, it's science fiction (and I'm a sucker for that genre).  The main objection I have about it is it's relentless 'persecution' of commercialization (not that it shouldn't be persecuted, just that the film keeps pile-driving the point home).  The special effects really aren't too bad - but that's mostly limited to the makeup, which is rather cute (especially the results showing the 'special' glasses being put on and taken off).  Another bone to pick is that it almost wants to lean heavily into the comedy genre, especially the closing sequences.  But overall I enjoyed it."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "They Live is a good & interesting movie for people who are into conspiracy theories but also for sci fi fans.

I read alot of good things about this movie and watched it. I liked the idea of the movie and it was different for that time. For your info, this movie is now considered cult classic like Carpenter's other movies.For me, the movie was nicely made and was dark and tense like Carpenter's other movies. There are some good tense scenes such as the climax scene. The suspense is also nicely built up and there are some surprises also.If we talk about performances, everyone did their job nicely. Direction by John Carpenter was just like his other movies such as Halloween and The Thing. There were a few issues with the pacing but it will not effect the overall experience.Overall, the movie is good and different for it's time.

But They Live has something more.... a cool way of unraveling and unfolding the plot!Carpenter here unfurls his movie's story as if he says to his audience: \"I don't care whether you're enjoying the movie or not. You came here for the movie's bizarre and outlandish concept, and here it is!\".Not too much dialogue; the thing that may make the viewer feel a bit bored, especially before the action rises. But so what as long as this brilliantly reflects the movie's themes of working-class subjection and media control!A very slow way of resolving the conflict of the plot; the thing that may infuriate the viewer, and make him worried lest the denouement would be so rushed. But so what as long as the results, as the movie proceeds and the end result, are more than fulfilling and rewarding!In all honesty, Carpenter went a bit too far to say the least. As the transitions between an act to another are quite abrupt and scrappy that can make you feel as if something is missing; something that is necessary to make you more convinced. The transition between the first and the second act can redeemed; because there is an information that is represented later at the second act in a most subtle way. But this is not the case about the transition between the second and the third act. As there are some things that should have been quite difficult to work out, but they ended up being solved pretty quick by some coincidences and plot holes. Let alone the major plot hole concerns the whole story that you may realize at the end, if not while watching the movie.It goes without saying that in They Live, Carpenter offers a timeless biting and daring political satire neatly encapsulated in a loony thought-provoking sci-fi flick while maintaining, at its core, its B-movie quality the genius director famous for.(8/10)"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "This was a pretty hilarious 80s Sci-fi B-movie .The acting was incredibly bad (but in a funny way) and for some reason they looped only 1 song in the entire movie (lmao).
