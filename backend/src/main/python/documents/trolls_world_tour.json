The animation was phenomenal, I love how colorful and artsy it is. The voice acting was outstanding especially from Anna Kendrick, James Corden, Rachel Bloom, Kelly Clarkson, Ozzy Osbourne, Walt Dohrn, Kevin Michael Richardson, Kenan Thompson, J Balvin, Sam Rockwell, Mary J. Blige, Anderson Paak, Ron Funches, Justin Timberlake, Ester Dean, Charlyne Yi, and Kunal Nayyar. The was overall a really good movie."

      "text": "It's entertaining for the kids, and the music is mostly good. Some good lessons in here for the little ones, too. However, it seems rushed at times, and there are some definite holes in the plot. One of the details of this movie's plot even seems to ignore the previous movie altogether or try to force a new interpretation on it (the main characters' romantic feelings for each other). It seemed in the first movie that Branch had already confessed, but now he's doing it again. In fact, a couple of scenes between the two in the previous movie were interrupted in the same way as more obvious romantic scenes (Gristle and Bridget trying to kiss), which implied that these interactions were romantic as well. However, now Branch is struggling to tell Poppy he loves her, which he already did in the previous movie. It just looks like the creators wanted to backtrack because they actually got a sequel. Unnecessary characters and scenes took away time that could have been spent developing the plot, and one of the characters introduced in here seems to be taking the place of another who goes unmentioned throughout the film. Besides that, there's a stereotype in here that some might find mildly offensive. When Poppy meets the Country Trolls, they're depressing as can be and don't seem to have the ability to look on the bright side at all. In fact, their leader flat out sings that they \"don't hope for making things better.\" While country music can be depressing, there's usually a small amount of hope tucked in the depressing lyrics somewhere if the song is just about life in general, like the one in this movie. That isn't the case in this movie, making country look like the music you listen to if you want to feel bad. It's not the best way to portray it if the idea is that differences are good and should be accepted. Tiny Diamond was an unnecessary character in a movie with an already inflated character list and only took away time that could have been spent developing the plot. In addition, when one of the characters has a change of heart, it seems to come out of nowhere because we don't really see any reasons for why he would suddenly decide to side with Poppy. It wasn't actually in his best interests, after all. Still, despite the rush, it had enough good points to earn a positive review."

      "text": "I liked this sequel.I admit that this may not be the most ambitious children's film ever made. I remember people complaining that the last film was predictable. I didn't see that. Here though, ... yeah. You get a quest for magical macguffins. You get a whole new brand array of trolls in order to sell merchandise. Plus, there is a formulaic \"guy tries to express his feelings to his love interest but can't quite get it out\" trope going on. However, what the movie lacks in originality, it makes up with presentation.The writers were clearly having fun in this. There are a couple jokes where I laughed out loud. With the trolls traveling across the land meeting more trolls, I felt there was more going on than in the first film. I expecially liked the new villain Barb (voiced by Crazy Ex-Girlfriend's Rachel Bloom). In comparison to the villain in the first film, who was mostly just served to move the plot along, Barb is more morally ambiguous and relatable with some amusing lines.The movie's message about accepting people's differences and different likes and cultures may not be the most original, but it is well done.I admit that due to the busy cast of characters, a couple of characters' storylines don't get a whole lot of conclusion. In particular, the writers didn't really seem to know what to do with Biggie (voiced by James Corden).World Tour continues with the fantastic-looking felt scrapbook look. This is even better looking than the first film. There's even a little visual experimentation in a couple parts.Overall, I think I might rewatch this more than the first Trolls because this is a general pleaser that delivers a lot."

What started as a fun take on the Infinity War, but with different music genres/worlds, turns into a critical race theory lesson in **** \"Hey kids, remember how you loved Poppy and her friends singing pop music? Turns out they're all horrible, privileged, white people who stole that music from black people. You're all villains in a game of racial power dynamics. Have fun!\" What a load of **** And just how did white people steal classical music from black peoeple? Stop trying to politicize everything, especially music. You're just pandering to the BLM idiots.Otherwise the animation and performances were fun. Shame. Like pop music, Trolls is more fun when you can just sit back and enjoy it without trying to shame anyone."

On the eve of the first Presidential debate of 2020, I thought I should watch something uplifting before the debate depresses me even further. So I went to a franchise that's brought me much joy over the last couple years, Trolls. Trolls World Tour is the follow up film to Trolls (2016). In this film, we follow our beloved Queen Poppy and Branch as they discover that they are but one of six different Troll tribes scattered over six different lands devoted to six different kinds of music: Funk, Country, Techno, Classical, Pop and Rock. As their world gets bigger and louder, so must their hearts when Queen Barb tries to take over and destroy music. High stakes for Poppy, Branch, and friends, but let's see if it's worth finding out the result.I'll tell you now that the storyline is predictable and unimportant. THE MESSAGE that we get from the storyline and songs, on the other hand is quite important, especially during this current time of divisive speech, social unrest, and political conflict. Inclusiveness, tolerance, acceptance and sharing are all worthy themes that are found throughout the film. This is a message that our current President, members of Congress, and each individual across the globe need to learn and truly embrace. Ok, enough of the feel good messaging. Trolls World Tour does plenty of that.Let's talk about the rest. The movie feels similar to Trolls, but in a way, it fails to live up to hype. We fell in love with Lady Glittersparkles and the lowly Bergens, but we got none of that magic. The characters we do get in this sequel are great, but there may be too many of them. We have \"yuge\" starpower in this movie. From Kenan Thompson to Kelly Clarkson and Mary J. Blige to Justin Timberlake, Trolls World Tour allows each to hit their moments but, boy, we could've had more. The songs in this movie are heartfelt and charismatic. The jokes are pointed and hard-hitting but there aren't enough. Trolls World Tour could've been purely a song fest with some comic relief, but unfortunately, there is too much chitter chatter. Yes, the chitter chatter furthers the great message but the songs make you feel it much more.Needless to say, Trolls World Tour is meant for teaching our future tolerance, respect, and love for the differences between each of us. This is a message that all leadership needs to endorse and follow. For that, Trolls World Tour is not a must see but I can promise you that you'll enjoy the tunes and laughs. Grab a bowl of popcorn and charge up your karaoke mic because the world tour is ready for you."
