I must confess that I understand the financial markets being a trader myself, so I have a first hand understanding of a world where the only thing that counts is profits. With that said I was in awe of the acting in this movie, notably Steve Carell and Christian Bale, the screenplay and the direction. It tells an important story and tells it well, with humor at times without which is would all have been too depressing."

      "text": "The Big Short is an intelligent movie - popcorn poppers looking for a little thrill ride down Wall Street with an excellent cast are sure to be left in the dust.  Wall Street is complex to the typical person, I followed it but only just barely.  Seeing several of the storylines that lead into one of the largest economical collapses of America is both incredible and worrisome.  To see so many professionals injecting so much convolution into the properties market on the back-end really makes you wonder how we managed to go so long without having a collapse sooner.  But this all happened and, in cases where applicable, the cast breaks that \"fourth wall\" to explain what's going on and if something absurd on screen actually happened (in most cases the answer is \"yes this actually happened\", or \"we're lead to believe this happened\").  Every actor in this movie turns in a solid performance, but I have to give a lot of credit to Steve Carrel for shining brightest in The Big Short.  He delivers with an incredible amount of conviction, as if he were actually in charge of an investment firm that just discovered the bedrock of America's economy were about to collapse.  It's all brilliant stuff, and the fact that it's true, or mostly-true, might make your jaw drop a little bit.  If you're into the business/finance world, this will be even more enjoyable for you, since the terminology which is only explained in small summations will be received like this was all everyday English.  If you can truly say to yourself \"I have a hard time following complex movie plots\", this will be a bit of an exercise.  I highly recommend this movie, but there are going to be a small group of people that have it all go over their heads, and thus short this movie when it comes to their opinions/reviews.  The Big Short is one of the better films I've watched in the past year."

It takes chances using offbeat conventions that are nothing new but unexpected for this subject.  However it is horribly shot emulating a show like \"The Office\" and is fairly sloppily edited at least in the cutting sense.  There is no reason ever to have that phony cinema v\u00e9rit\u00e9 video look for a theatrical motion picture.  It's an all too common dumb choice by filmmakers believing it makes it more real.  Hey I'll watch \"60 Minutes\" if I want real!\rThen again the director here has no sense of style, only a frat boy sense of humor.  It's funny at times yeah and yet tackles the complex content surprisingly efficiently, and that comes close to overriding the annoyances.  The Academy sheep didn't seem to mind them and nominated it best picture along with its slob director.  Ironic since it's that very sheep like mentality that the film is critical of."

      "text": "The visualization of American economy.Those who state that \"The Big Short\" is the movie for everyone are deeply mistaken because actually the film is sophisticated enough,complicated to understand.Especially,for people lack in analytical skills and who doesn't have knowledge in financial terminology.I regret I didn't listen financial literacy classes because if i did I would have understood this movie more clearly.Admittedly,I didn't even watch it till the end due to the brain load and,in my situation, when you can't get the idea thoroughly you just lose interest to continue watching that kind of movie.Despite this,I'll give a positive rate to this motion picture because i can see that it isn't some kind of nonsense yet very good-quality movie which deserves the attention of the Oscar's Academy.Basically,the genre is similar to \"The Wolf Of Wall Street\" but the second isn't so sophisticated and more of a comedy.Personally, I am a true scholar.That is why I don't know much about economic issues or financial system. Anyway, I was able to understand something.Although I'm not sure that I understood it completely,only superficially.As I had understood, one peculiar genious forecasted economic crisis in the future and he decided to earn some money on it by investing for banks which later would pay him in case his conjectures about decline in real estate market would be confirmed.After this crazy idea whetted,another man working in the same area,decided to follow the lead,involving other individuals.Subsequently, all these economists with the great plan above failed because market was stable due to banks' cheating.The end of the story is unknown for me but I suspect that they achieved what they wanted.The movie is brilliant for its impeccable performances.Actors' transformations are unbelievable so as viewers can have feeling that these people are real economists and not actors at all.I can pretty imagine how difficult it was to learn screenplay.Margot Robbie cheered with her small cameo.Among leading stars,I fancied Christian Bale,Finn Wittrok and Brad Pitt in the movie.Ryan Gosling is always the same in all his works.I don't really know what is so special about this guy apart from his charm.I regard him as a quite average actor.To sum up,I would recommend \"The Big Short\" to spectators who have clues and interests in economy world.Also,the admirers of high-quality movies could add this piece to their bucket lists."

I can imagine it was tough to jam that huge book into a movie, but they're not as successful in doing it as they were with Moneyball. The acting is top notch (especially Carrell's performance), but I felt that the little celerity asides explaining the financial products took us a bit too far out of the frame, though they are quite funny. Any of the primary actors could have achieved the same thing without making it feel like a stunt.  I enjoyed the film, and that wallop at the end makes it a cautionary tale worth heeding by our government."

I lived through the crisis, so I guess I know more than people who didn\u2019t have a lot of skin in the investment game at the time, but I still think the scriptwriter did an excellent job of explaining without teaching. The acting was uniformly excellent, and the script was terrific. It was both very funny and very scary because you realize that you can\u2019t do anything about it and something similar could easily happen again tomorrow, but I still think it is an excellent way to explain and teach without being a bore.

I had to close my eyes throughout most of it.  I don't know why directors and producers think this is a good idea.  Years ago if a cameraman showed me a tape he or she shot that was shaky, out of focus with fast pans I would fire them on the spot.  This is no way to present any visuals.

Director Adam McKay has utilized several cinematic tools to tell a complex and confusing story: entertaining montages, snappy editing, short scenes and clever comedy. He examines how the sub-prime mortgage crisis brought our country (and the world) to the brink of financial disaster and how a small group of smart investors managed to make big money on it. The short-attention-span pacing and McKay's wildly creative approach (with those absorbing performances) make the film entertaining and ultimately infuriating."

Yes, they're trying to liven up an otherwise boring topic that's more suitable as a documentary than a film drama, but they risk coming off as contrived, trying too hard. I think that's what aggravated me most; not everything is suitable for the theater, some stories are best done as television documentaries, and some are more suitable as a mini-series."

This might be my movie of the year if \"Mad Max\" and \"Ex Machina\" hadn't already come out. It's smart, hilarious, entertaining, and informative. Like \"The Wolf of Wall Street\", it breaks the fourth wall in all the right places and the energy and tension never let up. The performances don't really stand out as much as the film's script and actual true-to-life content but Carrell turns in some surprising work and the cast is solid all across the board. The only thing I felt was missing was any nod at all to the big brokers/investors like Peter Schiff, Marc Faber, and Jim Rogers, who went on TV (some as early as 2006) accurately predicting the crisis, and also made serious bank off of it. I understand this is not their movie but would have appreciated even just a small acknowledgment that, yes, SOME very smart financial people saw this coming and were able to get on TV to warn us... only nobody listened because each network had talking heads to counter-point them (seriously, just look those dudes up on YouTube). Super-highly recommended."

Adapted from Michael Lewis' book about 2008 global financial crisis, the screenplay from director Adam McKay co-writing with Charles Randolph does not broadcast the audiences directly to understand tonnes of financial theories, but to engage and enlighten through another creative way by mixing this dry lessons with parody and satire. Without a significant hero, the choice of the cast is definitely perfect - Bale, Carell, Gosling and Pitt perform extremely well, together with the supporting casts to play around with mortgage, subprime rates and credit debts. Despite illustrating this subject in a triumphant way, it has also successfully delivered self-awareness regarding desperation, political corruptions and collateral damages in economy slowdown; leaving an impression of skepticism on Wall Street while restoring some faith in Hollywood's capability in making great films."

Mr. Bale\u2019s character and 3 others find that the bundles of mortgages being sold by Wall Street firms to their investors are loaded with subprime (a/k/a) \"bad\") mortgages, most of which have adjustable sweetheart rates that end in or about 2007. Recognizing this and the debacle that will ultimately occur when mortgage rates and payments will suddenly soar and foreclosures will become the inevitable consequence,, these savvy mavericks swap or 'sell short' these bundles in order to reap the high profit that they anticipate will come about. The film is filled with trade acronyms and concepts that even well seasoned brokers would not understand so, in order to educate the viewing audience, stars like Selena Gomez, Anthony Bourdain and a lady in a bubble bath interject themselves into various frames in the film in order to explain to the viewer the complexities of these arrangements.\rThe vehicle works and what might otherwise have been a disaster of technical jargon becomes a more or less easily understood combination of events, both serious and comedic,  that led to the crash of 2008. There is no single performance that stands out although the sum of all them makes this a film that should be seen by anyone who directly or indirectly was impacted by what occurred in the fatal year when Wall Street houses and stocks crumbled. I give the film a 93 and recommend that it be seen if, for no other reason, to understand  how vulnerable an unregulated and rogue bunch of brokers, dealers and institutions can and, in fact, did manipulate the system."

      "text": "\u201cThe Big Short or \"A Funny Thing Happened On My Way to the Global Economic Meltdown\u201d\r THE HEDGE FUND MANAGER AS FOLK HERO\u2026..Okay, okay,  the idea may call for a little tweaking at first glance but in today\u2019s topsy-turvy world where- as Chris Hedges points out- almost every public institution has morphed into its opposite and become its own nemesis, this hedge-fund-manager-as-folk-hero idea might not be all that strange......In any event film maker Adam McKay makes a compelling, indeed fascinating case for this in his new film \u201cThe Big Short\u201d.\r The film is based on the Michael Lewis\u2019 book \u201cThe Big Short; Inside the Doomsday Machine\u201d and Adam McKay\u2018s film adaptation has wisely chosen to turn the story into a David and Goliath fable about \u201cthe little Hedge Fund that could\u201d. The result is a parable of daring existential savvy and \u201ccojones\u201d triumphing over institutionalized corruption and tunnel vision; the sort of thing Kierkegaard or Albert Camus would applaud in a nanosecond, and although not quite your by-the-numbers Robin Hood caper, then at least something sufficiently \u201cRobin Hood-ish\u201d to have something for everyone to take heart about (i.e., the previously mentioned Little-Hedge-Fund-That-Could angle).\r Incongruous as all of this may sound, the end result is an extraordinary cinematic and political delight from start to finish and is even (somehow?) perfect Christmas/Holiday Season fare. McKay\u2019s innovative direction and his extraordinarily inspired cast keep things percolating at just the right, slightly off-kilter and wacky tempo. Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Brad Pitt (one of the film\u2019s producers) and Ryan Gosling are all clearly on board with McKay\u2019s Smartest-Guys-in-the-Room interpretation of events that what ultimately comes across is a sort of Lord-of-the-Rings-Comes-to-Wall-St. epic that is the movie equivalent of a real page-turner ! It would be a serious mistake to dismiss \u201cThe Big Short\u201d as some kind of \u201cfeel good\u201d exercise about small time hedge fund types taking big risks and hitting the jack pot because this very unusual film is far more than a quirky comedy or satire.  When the dust finally settles what we have here is actually passionate, scathing and somehow monumental indictment not only of Wall St. but (even more courageous to state and more worrisome to consider) the outrageous complicity of elected  officials who chose to do the bidding of their \u201cToo-Big-To-Fail\u201d banking overseers\u2026..\u201cWall St. got bailed out, Main Street got sold out !\u201d as the popular chant goes. The SEC/Security  Exchange Commission, as well as the credit rating agencies  Standard and Poors and Moody\u2019s (see photo below) come in for more than a few well-deserved, well-aimed body blows.\r \u201c Big Short\u201d is an important film about what is arguably THE major struggle of our times: (a dismantled, downsized nominal democracy versus an insatiable and rapacious oligarchy). It also happens to be a work so strangely compelling that you will probably end up committing large chunks of it to memory after 2 or 3 viewings due to the fact that it regales us with such an audacious handling of its material - real gusto, passion and a sense of outrage rarely seen these days. What the viewer experiences is not unlike watching someone making their way  over Niagara Falls on a tightrope: you hold your breath, wrestle with the impulse to cover your eyes and yet- through the whole ordeal-  welcome every moment with real gratitude (psychologist Abraham Maslow\u2019s idea that our perception of Truth helps to keep us sane and healthy probably kicks in here somewhere.)\r This is also one of the most cinematically and politically FEARLESS films you\u2019ll ever see; every gamble the script makes (and there are many) and every wildly intuitive hunch the direction takes (and there many) pays off totally\u2026. nothing is overstated, no shot is held for even a nanosecond too long\u2026our interest never flags\u2026.You would have to go back to Robert Altman on a very good day I.e., \u201cNashville\u201d..\u2026.or Godard or Truffaut or Woody Allen on a good day to find a film this innovative.\rWhat we end up watching in \u201cThe Big Short\u201d is a story that is stranger than fiction and yet one that unfolds, is tried-and-true fairy tale tradition, with a cast of spellbound couriers, mysterious ancestral curses and wise old and not-so-old sages\u2026.in short the world that History itself appears to have been keeping in store for us now uber-challenged 21st century residents of planet Earth. All of this Adam McKay has chosen to direct with a gusto and panache that borders on audacity. Fortunately a kind of grace seems to hover over his every directorial decision and the result is dazzling and at times mesmerizing. We end up cheering for these underdog hedge fund managers who have thrown caution to the winds and risked everything on the use of their wits....as well as for a gifted American film maker and artist named Adam McKay who can so clearly empathize with them."

However, what it does do is give a powerful message of the corruption and influence of money in politics. The actors are fantastic in their roles and they work very well together. If you're looking for another reason to vote for Bernie Sanders you should see this movie."

      "text": "I laughed until I cried, then I cried until I was laughing again. And then I got angry.\r A roller-coaster ride of a movie, as entertaining as it is enlightening, as emotional as it is enraging.  A perfect mix of brilliant character study and social commentary.  The film is a bit much to take in at first, (especially combined with the sometimes too casual direction) and comes across as an extended 'Funny or Die' viral video. Once it hits its stride, you'll be so enraptured that you won't see the sucker punch coming.  And it comes. Hard.  Rarely has a film engaged me to this level. This is a movie you'll be thinking about and discussing for years to come. It will stick with you as you leave the theater, whether you want it to or not.  Required viewing for anyone that loves good movies and anyone that cares about the fate of our society."
