  "description": "After a failed swindle, two con-men end up with a map to El Dorado, the fabled \"city of gold,\" and an unintended trip to the New World.  Much to their surprise, the map does lead the pair to the mythical city, where the startled inhabitants promptly begin to worship them as gods.  The only question is, do they take the worshipful natives for all they're worth, or is there a bit more to El Dorado than riches?",

      "text": "Genuinely surprised that this is considered one of the bad Dreamworks films.The Road To El Dorado is not perfect, but it's charming. I thought the first 20 minutes were somewhat draggy and the backgrounds were kind of bland, but immediately when the main characters Miguel and Tulio actually get to El Dorado, the movie picks up a lot. The environment becomes colorful and beautifully detailed, the soundtrack is awesome and I was genuinely interested in everything.Though to be honest, the story is kind of bad. Once the characters get to El Dorado, the goal they set pretty much breaks the feeling of progressive plot movement because the characters basically just tell how this movie is going to end. Almost everything that actually happens in the El Dorado place feels like filler. It's not bad filler, it's very entertaining and charming to look at, but it's nonetheless filler. The only thing that has effect in anything is when the movie establishes the villain, who by the way was pretty useless in the end. And eventually when the third act kicks in, the movie isn't really even trying to build tension, and instead just rushes the ending and then just f*cks off. It really left me scratching my head and ass like \"that's it?\"None of this means that the movie is awful though. I really did enjoy it even though it has some flaws. The animation was very good, even though a bit weird from time to time. Especially in the last ten minutes where there was a weird blend of CGI and traditional that didn't go well together, but overall not a big problem. The characters were pretty nice, except the horse that was just pointless and retarded, and the villain that couldn't do anything. And the songs were really catchy. Almost everything has enough redeeming qualities to outweigh the flaws, even though there clearly are some."

Pero bueno, que me enrollo, \"El dorado\" era una pel\u00edcula que siempre hab\u00eda querido analizar ya que la gente la hab\u00eda valorado fatal, lo que pasaba, es que yo en esa \u00e9poca no conoc\u00eda ninguna web como esta, adem\u00e1s si hubiera escrito alg\u00fan an\u00e1lisis en esos tiempo os hubieran sangrado los ojos de la cantidad de faltas de ortograf\u00eda que ver\u00edais.Bueno, que hab\u00eda dicho que no me iba a enrollar mucho, esta pel\u00edcula es una pel\u00edcula de comedia con un toque de aventuras basada en la \u00e9poca de la colonizaci\u00f3n, esta situaci\u00f3n es bastante original, ya que aunque bastantes pel\u00edculas se hab\u00edan ambientado en esta \u00e9poca, no muchas se hab\u00edan atrevido a hacer comed\u00eda con ella, pero esto es normal ya que es un pasado muy oscuro de la historia tanto espa\u00f1ola como del mundo. Respecto a la comed\u00eda, que bajo mi punto de vista es el punto m\u00e1s importante de la pel\u00edcula, he decir que es brillante ya que usando un humor muy blanco te hace re\u00edr una y otra vez, pues aun habi\u00e9ndola visto varias veces anteriormente, la \u00faltima vez que la vi (que es desde la cual estoy dando mi punto de vista), lo que destaca en el humor blanco son los rostros, ya que tonter\u00edas como las que hace Miguel (uno de los dos protagonistas) pueden llegar a ser bastante graciosas.Respecto al tema de las canciones, yo he las he escuchado en Castellano, cantadas por Sergio Dalma. Estas me parecen un gran aporte a la pel\u00edcula ya que est\u00e1n muy bien llevadas e incluso he de decir que cuando no se que canciones escuchar me pongo canciones de esta pel\u00edcula.Claro, pero todo en la pel\u00edcula no est\u00e1 perfectamente llevado, como por ejemplo las escenas que tienen chistes sexuales, excepto una o dos que est\u00e1n bien llevadas, las otras son muy simples y no te hace re\u00edr.Bueno y eso es todo, espero que os haya gustado y creo que por ello se merece un 10 esta pel\u00edcula."

Una peli de aventuras simplona, absurda y sin mucho trasfondo. Miguel y Tulio son el t\u00edpico d\u00fao de protagonistas patosos, est\u00fapidos y cobardes pero de buen coraz\u00f3n, Chel la t\u00edpica chica coqueta, guapa y h\u00e1bil y Tzekel-kan un malo del mont\u00f3n. La animaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 bien, sin m\u00e1s. La banda sonora me parece bastante floja para venir de los se\u00f1ores Powell y Zimmer. La historia mediocre, predecible y plana. Sinceramente, no es una gran cinta; entretenida, sin pretensiones y para pasar el rato. Poco m\u00e1s. A los m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os seguro que les gusta pero a m\u00ed como gran fan del cine de animaci\u00f3n me ha dicho m\u00e1s bien poco."

What's next?  One of these about the holocaust?  This is unfortunately what this movie is, a tragic event in world history turned into animated entertainment.  The movie further perpetuates the negative slander of the spanish against the natives as cruel savages.  Truly an offensive movie for anyone who knows anything about history."

There is some great animation especially on the backgrounds. Some good humor from some likeable characters. Plus, you get a couple good songs. If you have some time to kill and this flick is On Demand, like it is right now until 5/30, check it out. While it may not be as hilarious as something like Dirty Rotten Scoundrels its characters and humor are good enough to make this worth a watch."

We quoted all the lines, we singing the songs from it and we know every single second from it by heart. It's pure entertainment! Every single scene, every single second of this film is just non-stop fun! Quotes are like:Depart mortal, before we strike you with a lightning bolt!Beware the wrath of the Gods! Be gone! Kkh kkh!Save it for the High Priest, honey, you're gonna need it.Kkh kkh!Miguel, it's not working.Kkh kkh!Miguel, you've been caught!Kkh kkh!Miguel. Miguel, wake up. We're there.We found it!Oh, yeah. We found it!Fantastic! Where is it? How far?Right here.Where?Here.Behind the rock?No, no. This is it.But, but... Give me that! This can't...Apparently, ''El Dorado'' is native for... GREAT... BIG.. ROCK!Hey, but I'll tell you what: I'm feeling generous, so you can have my share!You don't think Cortes could've gotten here before us and... and..And what? Taken all the really big rocks? The SCOUNDREL!Tulio! We... we've have to think about this, I... I mean we come all this way and... we... we... we... we should...Get... on... the horse!No, no, not with the face. Stop. Looks like there's a pass right over there....and many more.So Tulio and Miguel was voiced by Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh are going to the city of gold also known as El Dorado to find gold along with Altivo. They come across Tzekel-Kan voiced by Armand Assante, the chief and Chel. The songs are by Elton John and Tim Rice who worked on The Lion King however Hans Zimmer composed this movie with John Powell. The songs are upbeat and catchy as hell like the ones which Elton John sings apart from one song that is my personal favorite ''It's Tough To Be A God''. Me and Nathan have been singing it while we're travel training from our old school. This song will be stuck in my head for ages. I know everybody says that. The animation is (as always) is brilliant and that's it. That's all I can say about it. If you guys haven't seen it go watch it, you won't regret it. I mean, where would you be? You're missing out! Me and my friend Nathan Tolson loved it. It's very underrated! I'm surprised that I found out it's a box office bomb in the recent years and didn't make any sequels."

      "text": "An animated combo of the old Bob Hope--Bing Crosby \"Road\" pictures and \"The Man Who Would Be King,\" DreamWorks' third major feature cartoon, \"The Road to El Dorado,\" is a strained and pallid concoction that won't fire the collective imaginations of modern children.\r Five years in production, epic buddy picture went through two sets of directors and numerous evolving concepts, arriving finally at a middle ground between outright romp and a serious take on the arrival of the conquistadors in the New World. Subject matter is rife with possibilities, even for a moppet-oriented effort that obviously isn\u2019t going to grapple with such heavy themes as conquest and subjugation. \u201cPocahontas\u201d showed that it is possible to tread this sensitive terrain with a degree of balance and sensitivity in terms that kids can grasp.\r But whenever \u201cEl Dorado\u201d threatens to get serious, it backs off, retreating into loud shenanigans between its two mischievous heroes, complete with annoyingly anachronistic mannerisms such as high-fiving and shouts of \u201cYes!\u201d; vampy scheming on the part of its heroine, who looks and sounds like a Las Vegas tart; rambunctious action sequences and montage-oriented musical numbers that tend to center on general concepts (\u201cThe Trail We Blaze,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Tough to Be a God\u201d) rather than on immediate emotions.\r First quarter-hour introduces dark-haired Tulio (voiced by Kevin Kline) and blond-maned Miguel (Kenneth Branagh) as Spanish rascals who delight in creating scrapes and extricating themselves with devilish aplomb. After one prank too many, however, they find themselves trapped in barrels and placed aboard one of Cortes\u2019 ships headed across the Atlantic in 1519. With Cortes\u2019 noble horse, they escape in a lifeboat and finally wash up on a beautiful beach bordered by jungle.\r Quickly captured by imposing bronze-skinned natives, the boys think their goose is cooked upon arrival at the fabled city of gold, El Dorado. But the coming of such \u201cgods,\u201d as they are perceived to be, has been prophesied, and, after a bit of lucky shuffling and hocus-pocus, Tulio and Miguel are installed in exclusive quarters atop one of the city\u2019s many pyramids. Local babe Chel (Rosie Perez) is on to their game and blackmails the flummoxed pair into including her in their plan to escape El Dorado with a bounty of gold, courtesy of a large boat to be built especially for them.\r Although there is a local chief (Edward James Olmos), he, along with the rest of the community, is dominated by high priest Tzekel-Kan (Armand Assante), a commanding figure who pays elaborate homage to the white strangers at first but gradually becomes skeptical of their presumed divinity. The severe holy man is especially offended by the newcomers\u2019 oh-so-sensitive objections to human sacrifice, first when they prevent an execution, and later after the \u201cgods\u201d manage to win a furious ball game and then insist that the losers, contrary to custom, be spared. In a direct lift from the film \u201cThe Man Who Would Be King,\u201d Tzekel-Kan realizes that the visitors are just human beings after all when Miguel bleeds from a cut.\r Far too much time is devoted to the two charlatans\u2019 silly arguments about if and how they\u2019re going to pull off their charade, and to contretemps concerning Chel, whom they declare to be off-limits romantically but who manages to come between them nevertheless. By contrast, one of the script\u2019s more promising elements \u2014 Miguel\u2019s sudden surge of feeling for the local citizens and their gentle lifestyle when he mingles with them, to the consternation of his anxious partner \u2014 is given unduly short shrift. Even if \u201cthe allure of the primitive\u201d reps a cliche in the adventure/exploration genre, a bit more time devoted to it would have brought the setting and its inhabitants more to the foreground; as it is, there is no individuation among the native people.\r Kline and Branagh (last paired in \u201cWild Wild West\u201d) give boisterous, spirited readings to their characters, even if Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio\u2019s script provides them with few shadings or interesting traits. Assante registers strongly as the powerful priest.\r But the Chel character is so contemporary, and in a vulgar way to boot, as to be incredible and off-putting, and Perez\u2019s urbanite voicing doesn\u2019t help. Even Chel\u2019s motivation is unbelievable: El Dorado is presented as a Shangri-La\u2013like paradise, and no one in this sealed-off city would even know about another place to which he or she would want to flee.\r Visual design as overseen by directors Eric \u201cBibo\u201d Bergeron and Don Paul is colorful, sometimes attractive but never breathtaking. Animation, compositions and editing favor dramatic angles and fluidly changing perspectives that keep things interesting, while the characters are more commonly conceived; a few elements, notably the gold, are rendered with near-photographic realism. The animals on view comprehendingly participate in human endeavors but aren\u2019t anthropomorphized in traditional Disney fashion"

      "text": "It was a fun, one-time movie to watch, clearly the end of 2D animation. This movie is actually partially 2.5D, i.e. uses some 2D tricks to achieve 3D effect. Story is fine, villains are a bit underdeveloped I think, they could have done more with Cortes for example. I would have been really good 2 hour movie if they fixed some other plot points and \"convenience sake\" parts. But overall, it is fun. Some memes here and there, has some adult, non-childish moments that explore people's ambitions and how they change. Ends well, message is within \"seek what you really need, not what you want just because\". I disagree with critics."

      "text": "A slightly above average adventure comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously and it's meant to have a fun time. It has some good humor (although some jokes weren't funny), the characters are fun to watch and the pacing is good for the most part. The writing is fine I guess but there were some plot points that could've been fixed (Like the forced romance with two characters with no chemistry) and at times the movie drags with some filler scenes that could've been cut or made shorter (Like a battle that happens right before the third act, honestly, that scene was pointless). This might be an unpopular opinion, but I didn't really like the songs. Some of them were pretty forgettable and I felt like the movie was like \"Oh I'm an animated kids movie, I need to have songs\".The animation is fantastic. I have a love for 2D animation and I think it's hard to find a mainstream 2D movie you could say it looks bad. The backgrounds are eye-popping and beautiful, the characters are expressive and their movement flows smoothly. Really the animation saves this movie and gives it a lot of extra credit.Overall, this is one of Dreamwork's most underrated movies. It's a shame that it bombed when it first came out. I really liked it. I was entertained and invested in the journey even when it had some clich\u00e9s and pointless scenes. I'm not gonna nitpick too much because this movie is really easy to nitpick. Here's one: \"How come everyone speaks English?\""
