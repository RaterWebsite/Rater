The story is so predictable, you can guess how it ends just watching the trailer alone. They focus way too much on the humor, and I mean WAY TOO MUCH TIME. I'm not joking, there are about 10 characters attempting to be the comic relief. And the funny thing is, none of them are funny. Maybe a small chuckle came out because of Buck, but everyone else relies on their idiocy, moving around like they're in a Sony Pictures Animation movie, or just making bad puns. However, even if it is Blue Sky's worst film, it doesn't mean it can't offer anything good. To its credit, the end song is really good, the animation is stunning, especially in Geotopia, and I'll admit it, Scrat is kind of funny. Just not as much as the previous films.

The Ice Age movies get progressively worse, but this one is abysmal."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Oh god...this film shows how much this franchise has only gone downhill since the first movie. Well before I start my review I must say that I have watched every other Ice Age movie, the first one was good, the second was okay but forgettable, the third one was okay but more memorable than the second one maybe because of the dinos and the fourth one was terrible and extremely forgettable, I mean really I just can't remember anything from the fourth movie. Without wasting anymore time, lets start the review.\rLets start off with the story. While Scrat was doing its usual protect the acorn it ends up finding an UFO which he activates and after an accident creates a giant meteor that is going to fall on earth, and because of that, manny and his friends must go to a certain place in order to change the course from the meteor.\rWell...the main theme of the whole franchise is its own name, the ice age, but this fifth installment just doesn't feel like a movie about an ice age anymore with all those space ships and bizarre \"crystals that make you young\" worlds, it feels more like a mess of a world with some snowy sceneries to try justifing the name of the film. The older movies used to follow the ice age theme pretty well, with the first and second movies as biggest examples, and they were also quite realistic with this theme as well, with the animals fighting to find a place to live after a flood, but collision course just doesn't do that to the point of being completly silly. Speaking on silliness.\rIf there is one thing that this movie went way overboard is the humor, while this is a very important element in a kids movie, I guess it filled the script with so much unnecessary humor to the point that it lacks drama. The older films used to add a bit of drama to the story in order to make it more balanced such as in the second one with Manny's wife back story for example, but in this movie I just can't find a single at least touching moment. As for the humor, while there are some good jokes here and there, a few of them aren't all that funny to be honest.\rBy the way, this film doesn't have a villain...wait, there actually is a villain, three of them actually, and they are a family of some dino birds who want the meteor to fall on earth in order to kill everyone and make them the only survivors, I know, it is a stupid idea (dinosaurs weren't really known for being smart). These are without a doubt the worst villains in the series, they only do one somewhat significant thing in the story and that is about it, the rest of the film they spent their time literally goofing around just to befriend the heroes at the end (by watching the film it becomes very obvious they are going to become good so it isn't that bad of a spoiler).\rAnother huge issue this movie has are the characters. There are many of them...too many. The characters in this film not only get little to no character development but are very forgettable and some of them felt just unnecessary to the plot (looking at you Sid's Grandma, I mean really, there was any reason to include her in hte story despite to bring even more humor to the story). This movie lacks focus, I didn't felt interested on any of these characters and even some of my favorites such as Diego and Sid did almost nothing in the story.\rWell I guess it is time to say some good parts about this mess of a movie. I am not really good at rating animation but I guess it felt good with some smooth movements and with the characters being very expressive, and the characters designs are also pretty good and there truly are some funny moments on this movie.\rThis pathetic excuse for a sequel shows it is time to finally put a nail in the coffin of this once good franchise. It might provide some fun for children, as for adults not so much, but just like the fourth movie, this one in bound to be forgotten.

If you don't give me a great story, then it's over. I'm not going to Fandango and spend $15.00 to watch this snoozefest unless you freshen up with a reboot. It's another example of bad movie sequels failed big time to match their predecesors (Zoolander 2, Alice Through The Looking Glass, TMNT 2, etc.) I guess I'd just save my money for Suicide Squard (or I'd like to call them \"The DC Villain Expendables\").

They had likable characters, an interesting story, top-notch animation, etc.  Ice Age 3 was where I started to question whether or not the series was going anywhere, and Ice Age 4 was complete crap.  So where do you go after complete crap?  Complete garbage.  This is easily one of the worst films of the year so far.  The characters that the movie try to introduce are uninteresting, the plot is nothing but a re-telling of the 4th movie, and there was hardly anything that made me laugh, minus one or two scenes with Scrat.  Ice Age 5 also tries to throw in many subplots, and give you little reason to care about them.  The charm and magic that made the first 2 good is nowhere to be found; it's as if the creators never watched the first two films.  Granted, the animation was decent, and kids may find some enjoyment out of it, but that's about it.  Ice Age 5 is nothing but a bland, uninteresting, and boring sequel that does nothing to add to the franchise.

I mean, it's not like any of the sequels lived up to the first anyway, but this is the first one that feels like it's run slam out of ideas for laughs.

Rather than real jokes all we get is a bunch of dumb physical humor, silly antics that are more obnoxious than amusing, and butts. You know, because butts are funny. Why? Because they're butts. Or at least that's what Collision Course keeps trying to sell us on. I have a hard time believing that even the youngest among us will find this all that funny.Like I said, the plot is absurd.

This is a most simplest film in the 'Ice Age' series. For the first time, the franchise is in real trouble.

I think it won't get bigger than this in a concept wise. Particularly Scrat who has been the backbone for this series donned with a spacesuit. Like Minions and Penguins, I too want Scrat's stand alone film.

What started as a emotional and poignant incident more than one decade ago, has evolved admirably, but not always with satisfactory results. The fifth installment opens with a shameful but entertaining prologue focused on the endless mishaps that suffer our saber-toothed squirrel, Scrat (Chris Wedge), mishaps that leading him to outer space, seemingly, a safe place, however, Scrat continues his battle causing a chaotic clash of worlds, projecting millions of purple meteors to planet Earth, endangering the life of all animals.\r Indisputably, Scrat is Blue Sky's emblem, what is Buzz Lightyear or Nemo for Pixar. Regardless of the frequency of his appearances,  he always maintains his crazy and stimulating essence in each act, and without him, it would not be possible more films in the saga. Screenwriters and writers have discovered the rough gem that was hidden since 2002, a small and irritating animal, focusing on each plot twist as a consequence of the facts carried out by the squirrel, one point in favor. \"Ice Age\" still has future and even with Pixar (\"Finding Dory\") and Illumination (\"The Secret Life of Pets\") on the look-out, Many, Diego and Sid have high possibilities to continue with the winning streak at the box office, at least, that seems.\r The fate of prehistoric mammals has been relatively good, and it seems that everyone (with exceptions) live in pairs. Manny (Ray Romano) and Ellie (Queen Latifah) face the rapid maturity of their daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer), who is in a kind of relationship with Julian (Adam Devine). A sub-plot anything original and very predictable, since Julian did not get along with Manny, but yes he got along with others, unleashing the envy and jealous of the mammoth, and if there is someone so naive, it has a happy ending. Nothing new!. Diego (Denis Leary) and Shira (Jennifer Lopez), the saber-tooth tigers, get supporting roles and their characteristics fades for a moment, besides, the screenwriters give clues of a possible litter between these two tigers in one scene, something that continues leading it astray. They should perhaps rethink the spin-offs about a character in specific, for not to damage to generational characters. Sid (John Leguizamo) is still in an emotional imbalance, something by what we love him, much of the comedy is centered in this cute animal that will continue producing loud laughs for the rest of our lives. The opossums, Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck) remain comical objects used for the humor of the film. Buck (Simon Pegg), the star of \"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs\" is infuriating, cumbersome and rough, his jokes and eccentricities did not entertain children nor adults, a character who has to be eliminated immediately. Despite this, he's who predicts the catastrophe, and he's who attracts new, humiliating and poor villains, more filler unnecessary to the story.\r With the seriousness of a cataclysm and so witty characters, Mike Thurmeier and Galen T. Chu recreate a balance between comedy and drama, unbalancing briefly because of Buck. It still is space for moments unique and even memorable, but in a epoch in where is difficult find interesting proposals, \"Collision Course\" comes off  well rid, despite its reused plot. The teachings are also present, the acceptance of a father to the maturity of his daughter, a young's independence, over-protection errors and family work are some of the lessons that the movie wants to assert.\r Soundscapes doesn't reach the visual spectacle that has been regenerated with the passing years, however, it achieves the ambitions proposed. Purple's tonality of the shooting stars , the textures of reptiles and mammals, effects in the sky, the brightness of Geotopia and more details open a privileged place to position itself as a nice addition to the animated world. New characters are insufficient and none manages to deliver what they promised, so it leaves on a slope to the likely next sequel.

The first one is one of my favorite animated movies of all time and one of my favorite non-Disney or Pixar movies, the second one was okay, the third was mediocre at best, the fourth one was awful and this...I don't have words to describe.They turned Ice Age into an Illumination kind of movie. The plot, the dialogue, the characters, everything is now dumbed down to appeal to stupid kids. You might say that that's the point (it's made for kids)but just like with Minions, Cars 2, Ralph Breaks the Internet, and all the Illumination movies, that's no excuse to make a movie that has zero artistic value and that treats kids like if they're stupid. Great animated movies for kids are those that both kids and adults can enjoy and get something from and this is not the case, this is a movie that was made for no other reason that to give BlueSky some money because Ice Age and Rio are their only profitable franchises, so, they need to keep making these movies even if it doesn't make any sense, right?I don't give it a 0/10 because Scrat is in it and his scenes are the only ones that made me laugh."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "La pel\u00edcula tuvo un aire fresco con la llegada de nuevos personajes. Pel\u00edcula muy buena y divertida."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Goodjob BSS very Great and Good Movie, but kind of disappointed me because Shira and Diego did'nt talk to much and shira did'nt speak much and that's how it gets boring but I liked it so much and nice movie.Respect and Support for Blue Sky Studios."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Another hilarious Ice Age. These are definitely my favorite animation series. I normally hate animation movies. With the exception of Beavis & Butthead."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Ice Age: Collision Course ... cmon. For the fifth episode, I went to the cinema with all my doubts. Four, although it was a good film, it just occurred to me that the authors are already cooking a little out of the water and they don't know much about the series and beyond, and unfortunately this film signed it, totally. I don't like to say it or rather I write in this case. The film, which had such a great plot in the first part and the epic event in the third, doesn't offer us much here. The story for me is pretty much nothing. Not much plot. I honestly don't even know what this film was about anymore. Absolutely forgettable. Excuse me, hate. I apologize to the fans of the series, but for me it's simply nothing more than an average film that I wouldn't recommend to fans of the series. In the end, despite all the hate, I praise the animation, which is beautiful and for a lot of scenes, I just said WOW. Unfortunately, the beautiful spectacle is here almost everything in my opinion, what you can see here."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "this movie is the worst movie from 2016 along with sausage party and norm of the north! the first 3 ice age movies are way much better than this!"}], "recommendations": ["ice_age_continental_drift", "ice_age_dawn_of_the_dinosaurs", "escape_from_planet_earth", "the_smurfs", "alvin_and_the_chipmunks_chipwrecked", "penguins_of_madagascar", "planet_51", "free_birds", "ice_age_the_meltdown", "minions", "diary_of_a_wimpy_kid_the_long_haul", "incredibles_2", "spy_kids_all_the_time_in_the_world", "scooby_doo", "the_boss_baby_family_business", "despicable_me_3", "teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles", "chicken_little", "night_at_the_museum_battle_of_the_smithsonian", "the_angry_birds_movie", "hotel_transylvania_2", "teen_titans_go_to_the_movies", "cloudy_with_a_chance_of_meatballs_2", "zookeeper", "yogi_bear"]}
