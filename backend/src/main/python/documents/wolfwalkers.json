Wolfwalkers isn't just the best animated movie of 2020, but also one of the best movies i've seen in a long time. Phenomenal animation mixed in with great voice acting, a fantastic cast of characters, lots of heart and emotion, and a solid story with powerful themes that'll definitely be talked about long after you've seen the movie, Wolfwalkers is easily an amazing achievement in filmmaking, and it perfectly shows and proves that 2D animation is still alive and strong."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "It\u2019s not just one of the best animated films I\u2019ve seen in my life, it\u2019s one of the best films overall and the piece left in this puzzling year.There\u2019s not a single stroke of pencil or brush that does not belong here, in a moving and visually incredible masterpiece."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Outstanding!

I was privileged to watch this before it\u2019s released to the general public at the Savannah Film Festival. There\u2019s a lot here to appreciate. The animation is one of them. It\u2019s simplistic but it still looks incredible. Every character, every building, every tree is different and unique from the next and the way they frame these shots is great. The animation style makes these environments look rich and beautiful. The performances are great too. Each cast meme we did a great job portraying their characters especially Sean Bean and these portrayals made the emotional beats hit much harder and this is all due to the great character development and writing. Every main character has a purpose and an arc they go through like the father realizing that just because something may look dangerous on the outside doesn\u2019t mean they are dangerous on the inside. The story here is simplistic and that\u2019s what I think holds this film from a 9/10 or a 10/10. Elements of the story feel a little basic but that\u2019s okay because it\u2019s not geared towards adults. This was an incredible animated movie and I\u2019m thankful that I got to check it out early. Please watch this when it comes out later this month. It\u2019s probably the best animated film of the year and I don\u2019t see anything else topping it."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "BEST anime movie 2020.

Muy pocas pel\u00edculas para mi han destacado realmente, y sorprendentemente Wolfwalkers lo ha conseguido, o al menos en su mayor\u00eda. Ha conseguido destacar y convertirse en una de mis pel\u00edculas animadas favoritas en mucho tiempo. Incre\u00edble historia, hermosos gr\u00e1ficos y personajes super memorables. Me hubiera gustado que contaran un poco mas sobre el pasado de los Wolfwalkers y su origen, pero sigue siendo una pel\u00edcula sobresaliente, una pel\u00edcula que esta por encima de la media."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Every time I hear someone say \"I wish Hollywood still made 2D-animated films\" I always point them to Cartoon Saloon. While their stories can be simple, the artistic style that Tomm Moore brings to his films are astounding and Wolfwalkers just may be the prettiest animated film I have ever seen. The art style is striking, the character designs are appealing and the first person perspective shots are animated beautifully and absolutely captivating. I can't praise the visuals of this film enough and in my opinion, is enough to warrant even just a cursory look into the movie.As for the plot, much like their other works, is pretty straight forward and doesn't have the emotional punch that we can get from the likes of Pixar's best. But wolfwalkers doesn't need to be a Pixar film and it may actually be to its detriment. Tomm Moores films have been going for more of a fairy tale feel for his films and he executes them in a way that makes the world feel magical rather than just a film with magic in it. Wolfwalkers is no different and the story does read like an old Irish tale. To get into specifics, the story is about two girls from two different worlds (one from a human town and the other living in a magic forest) who meet and become friends. We've seen this plot before, but being familiar does lend itself to the fairy tale aesthetic that the film is going for. The characters are likeable in both their portrayal and in their designs and serves the story that they are trying to tell. In short, the story isn't new and exciting, but it is the way that they tell it and the visuals that they accompany with the story telling that makes it wolfwalkers compelling."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This is yet another beautiful Cartoon Saloon film. A beautiful folklore-ish story/plot with intriguing characters, enchanting animation and some lovely folk music played in the background. What's not to love? the animation isn't neon bright like some kids films - this is a film both children and adults can enjoy, its not dumbed down or anything, like the other Cartoon Saloon films, its just...lovely. A very enjoyable, sometimes sad but ultimately a great film. I felt it was somehow, somewhat uplifting too. Highly recommended."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "When you spend this much time on the animation, you should spend at least as much time on the script. Not so here. An astonishing visual landscape is given the short shrift by a repetitive and imprecise screenplay. The Wolfwalkers are human while awake but during sleep they \u201castral project\u201d themselves into wolves \u2013 the entire plot hinges upon the capture of the Queen wolf, but all she had to do to escape was wake up. Stupid. Add to this about three dozens scenes where the villain threatens the main characters with increased servitude \u2013 plus shrill voice acting from two teenage leads \u2013 and you\u2019ve got yourself a film that looks far better than it actually is."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I wish to get a Slovenian Citizenship after watching this film.
