      "text": "I thought Happy Feet 2 was a good success, but I agree with the critics because I just don't want to waste too many tickets to see the movie. The musical numbers were something familiar and I think it's a mash-up between pop and hip-hop that resemblance many great artists. I'm very disappointed at Warner Bros. because I thought they should've released Happy Feet 2 on DVD although the scenes were a little too dark for kids and families and so I should spent my time see Alvin and the Chipmunks already. But just like \"Cars 2,\" \"Happy Feet 2\" is a total misfire. I'm sad to say that \"Happy Feet 2\" is one of the biggest disappointments of the 2011."

Along wit h its top notch voice acting the film succeeds and is a rare sequel that I think is better than the fist mostly because of it just being so adorable. I give this fantastic  movie 88%."

Far weaker in storytelling and keeping audience interest than the original film."

      "text": "I think people are being way too harsh on this movie. Some critics refused to look deeper because this is not your usual type of kiddie animation film. I am actually shocked at reading some of the scathing reviews. Also, I think people are being too hypercritical because the first Happy Feet won the Oscar.\r I loved this movie. I found it far superior to Rango, Gnomeo & Juliet, and Cars 2. The animation was amazing. I think it has the best production values and cinematography of any animated film of 2011, I have seen so far. It has wonderful music. The story is in-depth, layered, complex, and much more meaningful than the first Happy Feet. Mumble and Erik are great characters. The voice acting was incredible. Pitt and Damon were standouts. There are important themes and messages about community, teamwork, bravery, overcoming obstacles, environmentalism, and how all walks of life connect to teach other. The movie was ambitious, it has a few flaws in that the plotline can be tedious and the dialogue could have been better, but the overall effect was great. I laughed, cried, and felt such empathy for these penguins. This movie has a lot of soul and heart. Erik, Atticus, and Bo are just adorable. There were so many twists and turns. The movie avoids some standard cliches. I just felt the amount of effort and hard work the entire cast and crew put into this movie. It is shame it has bombed at the box office and some critics are being too cold to it."

L'animation s'est vue embellir question qualit\u00c3\u00a9 par un travail d\u00c3\u00a9taill\u00c3\u00a9 de chaque personnage (duvet, peau, carapace...) et d\u00c3\u00a9cor (neige, banquise, herbe...). Question humour, cette suite propose des id\u00c3\u00a9es totalement loufoques et g\u00c3\u00a9niales, \u00c3\u00a0 commencer par les krills. En somme, c'est du Happy Feet! Et la musique? Voil\u00c3\u00a0 ce que je consid\u00c3\u00a8re comme le point faible par rapport au premier : cet opus est beaucoup moins port\u00c3\u00a9 sur les chansons et la danse, et le sc\u00c3\u00a9nario n'est pas si exceptionnel que \u00c3\u00a7a (malgr\u00c3\u00a9 quelques \"remarques\" \u00c3\u00a9cologiques). Mais l\u00c3\u00a0 o\u00c3\u00b9 j'ai \u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 d\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a7u (et faut prendre en compte que la vf), c'est le changement de voix de certains personnages et surtout la plupart des chansons qui ont \u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 traduites (\u00c3\u00a7a fait spectacle des Enfoir\u00c3\u00a9s).

Such is the case with \"Happy Feet Two,\" a sequel that isn't really bad, just uninspired in comparison to the previous film. It's well-animated and it even has a few heartwarming moments, but it's not as well-written, the characters aren't as memorable, and it's just not as exciting. It's certainly a great film for children, but I'm not sure who else to recommend it to. If you enjoyed the first film a lot, you'll probably be disappointed by this one. All I can say is keep your expectations tempered if you really want to get some enjoyment out of \"Happy Feet Two.\""

The intro was a bit sappy and not great for attention grabbing but I was impressed a bit later in the film. It did have some great humor so I will give it that but this Sven character is just stupid and lame and this film would have done awesome without him. I also don't understand how that iceberg that blocks Emperor Land for most of the film manages to get from the water all the way over there and through the thick snow and ice along the way that makes absolutely no sense. However there was some better music in this one than the first one like Erik's Opera which he sings to the elephant seals and then there is Under Pressure that they all sing when the Adelie penguins and elephant seals are all working to break down the giant iceberg that is probably my favorite scene in the whole movie. I just thought this movie would be as awesome as the first one and even though it isn't quite up there it is still pretty good I have definitely seen worse."

As often does, these animated characters are created in order to glorify their characteristics and stand against the nature of their selves for the better part of the environment. But this well thought out concept is overridden in here till it grows numb, after a while you stop caring for them since you are no longer afraid for them. And what was once willfully and beautifully structured, is somewhat of a mirror in here to the previous installment and even though it reaches to its concept with a big heart, it also is arguably repetitive. Having said that, it doesn't suggest that it isn't entertaining or gripping storytelling.Tapping on its own feet and singing on its own rhythm it still is a delight to watch these characters go banana over each other. Aforementioned, Miller fiddles with the nature of their beings, and chooses a higher moral ground after tangling them into a whirl of a huge disastrous experience. Each subplot of different characters are also a lesson to be learned, most likely to be a good will hunting. Like two animals sharing a bridge on the opposite side of it, trying to cross it safely. These little details on the plot is what makes it rich and juicier.The returning voice cast is doing their best considering the opportunity they have got, and of course Williams stands along for his comic voice that echoes throughout the course of the feature. Damon and Pitt arguing philosophically are one of the best bits of this sort-of-inspiring tale. Happy Feet Two's fatal attempts on reaching for something beyond its grasp is both admirable and disappointing, this time they failed to save the world within a tap dancing number."

      "text": "The next generation of Mumble's penguin empire focuses on his son's dilemma only for it to be identical as the first film, but not involving the lack of a heartsong and a conspiracy involving the main characters, just witnessing an Antarctic ice age that causes another  famine. This has a repelled story with Brad \"Will\" Pitt plays Will the krill and Matt Damon plays Bill the krill who both are on a quest to ascend them selves on the food chain cycle but both go crazy when they have negative omissions on each other as they navigate through their mission. The enthusiasm on these two are high enough to make you wanna see more of Pitt and Damon as their talent for acting has not dwindled. I mentioned at the beginning of the paragraph that this krill story is repelled from Mumble's, meaning that Robin Williams and Matt Damon, who starred in \"Good Will Hunting\" collaborate in this animated sequel, but not with their characters, which I was excited for beforehand.I was hoping that the breaknecking shots that rumbled my seat from the first film would return here, but I found its status unchanged, just like the acceptable payoff that both films have. The animation and environment are just as engaging as we witnessed the first part in 2006 and this second part is as family-friendly, which I found a bit concerning but not disappointing."
