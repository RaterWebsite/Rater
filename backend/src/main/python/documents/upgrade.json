And it's a good one, convincingly depicting ghettoes filled with the disgruntled lower class juxtaposed with futuristic tech like automation, holographics, AI, and robotic prosthetics. That last one in particular is an important theme in Upgrade, which should thrill those who've played the newer Deus Ex titles because this movie does it better. It's impressive worldbuilding that makes me want a sequel. The bad part about this movie: It's twisty in ways that are easy to predict, and it's not that deep despite being a convincing world. However it is very fun and worth watching."

The story wasn't to ambitious which resulted in a very streamlined, smooth story, which allowed for sufficient character development. It featured charm as well as competent acting. Not gut wrenching but leaves you satisified with the realistic portrayal of disastifaction of an age where emotions are replaced with technology. I was surprised to find it so original providing the amount of attempts at this genre including blade runner and elysium but its reserve pays off providing an impression of a world not so distant from now. Logan Marshall Green deserves more opportunities to fine tune his abilities, and I hope this allows him to be seen as a unique talent."

It takes place in a gritty lived-in cyberpunk universe, it is about the dangers of artificial intelligence, and one of the central characters is the main character\u2019s alter ego. However, unlike Venom, Upgrade takes it all the way with all the violence and cursing that you\u2019d want out of a mature-rated action-science fiction film! There\u2019s no cutting away from people\u2019s heads being bitten off to get a PG-13 rating here!

      "text": "We live in a day in age that generations past would only be able to dream of thanks to the wonders of modern technology. If someone had told a younger version your grandparents that in their lifetime we\u2019d have self-driving cars and computers that fit into the palm of your hand, they probably would\u2019ve had them committed to the nuthouse. These are ideas that have been part of science fiction for decades and have since become a reality. Knowing that, the premise of the futuristic film Upgrade doesn\u2019t sound too far off, with its cybernetic-enhanced human beings.The film follows Grey Trace, played by Logan Marshall-Green, a self-described technophobe that rebuilds classic cars for a living. After dropping off his newest masterpiece to a wealthy PC mogul, Grey and his wife are involved in a car accident turned murder that seems to be due to foul play on the part of the couple\u2019s highly advanced self-driving car. This leaves Grey powerless as a quadriplegic and his wife dead. The previously mentioned mogul, Jeff Hadley played by Steve Danielsen, is the developer of the STEM microchip. Hadley claims that this device can learn and adapt to anything, organic or PC based, and improve on its basic structure.Hadley offers Grey a once in a lifetime opportunity to repair his broken body by allowing him to have STEM inserted into his severed spinal cord, under one condition \u2013 he can tell no one about the procedure, as this isn\u2019t approved by the FDA or whatever government division the film alludes too. The process is a success, and gives Grey the ability to walk again, with a strange side effect- STEM begins talking to him (voiced wonderfully by Simon Maiden), forcing his ear drums to vibrate at a frequency only he can hear. When given full control of his body, STEM turns Grey in to a super soldier, with lightning fast reflexes and a fighting ability that would give Neo a run for his money. Against Hadley\u2019s request to lay low and keep quiet, Grey sets off on a path to solve the who\u2019s and why\u2019s behind his wife\u2019s murder with his newfound friend.The acting itself is respectable, with the majority of the cast bringing their best effort, but it feels as if the film would\u2019ve been a bigger hit had more noteworthy actors (with better acting chops) stood in. Marshall-Green brings a decent performance; delivering a number of smartass one liners with so much ease he could give Deadpool a run for his money. The thing is, he doesn\u2019t have the presence nor build that the lead character should bring to the table, looking more like a stunt double for Tom Hardy. Throughout the film I kept thinking that this would\u2019ve been elevated from an epic straight to video title to a decent blockbuster film had they used a bigger name in his place. I\u2019m only assuming that Hardy turned down the role because he wouldn\u2019t have to hide his face.The film provides some noteworthy action scenes, but sadly, not enough of them. I found myself losing interest with a few of the subplots, such as the police being hot on the trail of Grey after failing to solve his wife\u2019s murder while the lowlifes in the area start dropping, or Grey\u2019s life post-accident/pre STEM. The latter of these is simply depressing for long periods of time. Writer/Director Leigh Whannell tries to balance this with some comedy, primarily with the previously mentioned mid-fight quips and frequent jokes between Grey and STEM, which often work but fall back on STEM not getting sarcasm a little too often. The saving grace is Whannell\u2019s background in horror which brings some nice thematic elements, particularly the chilling ending, that other director\u2019s may have taken a pass on. There\u2019s a fair amount of gore, with most of the battles ending in at least one uber-violent yet creative death scene.The overall plot is fairly predictable, as I was able to pick apart the majority of it minutes into the film. At the end of the day, the movie comes across as a technologically upgraded version of Death Wish, with touches of many popular Sci-Fi films sprinkled in for good measure. The majority of the twists and turns end up being overly obvious way before they should have made an impact on the viewer. The single exception to this is the finale, which paints a spine tingling picture of where we may be headed as a society as well as setting up for a sequel or franchise.Upgrade is by no means a bad film; had this been released as a straight to video title, it would likely (and may possibly) reach a cult status in no time. Even with its shortcomings, I look forward to seeing Whannell\u2019s next effort, be it STEM and Grey related or otherwise."

Considering this was made for humble 5 million with Whannell teaming up with Blumhouse, its visuals look near flawless and the story is incredibly captivating. The Realistic futurism in the props, set pieces, vehicles, and all of the other vastly complex technology is astounding. Whannell's color schemes and sleek lighting patterns flourish with impeccable camerawork and the action is brutally clever and intensifies at lightning speed. The story is insanely well written and utterly engrossing with Logan Marshall Green showing his extremely underrated acting versatility once again and when the ending hits, it hits hard and effectively out of left field. The soundtrack was perfectly bizarre and matched the futuristic theme incredibly maybe even more than Blade Runner 2049. Leigh Whannell proves once again his writing and directing is vibrantly detailed with outstanding striking visuals, and thoroughly engrossing storylines that defy hollywood standards with sheer experimental genius and ambition. He is going to finally get some deserved recognition for this amazing accomplishment, and I predict this will become a film that many will remember for its visceral smart tech sci fi approach, and might be a spot on prediction of what's to come with our increased smart tech society. If we aren't careful stem/technology will take over the world and this film portrays that immaculately with style and substance to the highest degree."

There\u2019s not much to say about this film, but this film is the dystopian future version of John Wick and Blade Runner combined. Nonetheless, it could be a sci-fi body horror neo-noire cult classic in the future."

      "text": "I've just finished watching it as I write this. It's a very dark film, and the early scenes, where the protagonist is reduced to a quadraplegic, are genuinely grim. It's pretty gory, and the fight scenes are fairly frequent, but while a lot of the reviews make it sound like the Matrix or similarly elegant films, the hand-to-hand combat is instead robotically efficient and deeply visceral, as during extreme moments the hero cedes control of his neocortex to an onboard computer chip, STEM, that acts as the protagonist's onboard, hyperviolent Alexa.  Those fight scenes have a creepy, lurching quality as our hero is effectively puppeteered by STEM and with their jarring switches of camera angle throughout they're not entirely enjoyable to watch. What makes it hard to look away is the spectacle of a human being operating completely unconstrained by normal reaction times or the slowness of thought that makes human beings graceful but ineffective fighters. Seeing two humans both operated by STEM-like systems, going at one another full-tilt, is the film's high-point. It's genuinely unsettling, not for the violence but for the mathematical precision of it all. (If that's what proxy wars between countries will look like, with AI soldiers fighting each other instead of humans, it might end up being even scarier than warfare as it stands today.) It's a bit of a grindfest, with little light or humour, and the future world in which the film takes place is a little claustrophobic, probably due to budget constraints, but what elevates it above other films in the revenge genre is the brutal, ugly efficiency of the fight scenes and, more than that, the sinuous plot. It's got a kind of momentum that only increases as the film goes on, while the effectively minimal score throbs underneath. The aesthetic is like a very cheap Bladerunner but it conveys something of the griminess of what takes place. It's a grubby film all told, and it's not washed clean with a happy ending. There are no likeable characters, no-one really to root for beyond the protagonist, an actor from something I can't put my finger on, and who is instantly unlikeable but grows on you very mildly as you watch. So you're not going to skip out of the cinema afterwards. As I've said, it's the narrative that ends up elevating it. It keeps you guessing throughout, propels the hero forward with clean lines and clear motives, and finally, just when you expect a relatively straightforward, messy, unsatisfying conclusion, the whole film is pulled together at once by one of the most elegant moebius strip twists that I've seen in a very long time. It really is worth seeing for the the precision and beauty of the bow that's finally tied at the end. When the curtain was pulled back I just had to shake my head and laugh at the audacity of it all. TL:DR - come for the fight scenes, stay for the elegantly conceived narrative."
