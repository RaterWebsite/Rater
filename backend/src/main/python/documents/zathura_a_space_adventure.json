      "text": "Basically Zathura is the Sci-Fi version of Jumanji. While there are several cameos, the young cast carries the movie and you can sort of see why today names like Josh Hutcherson and Kristen Stewart are household names. The young cast does a great job, especially when you consider that most of the special effects were computer generated, and the majority of acting was done in front of a green screen. Zathura is a sweet game and an interesting movie, with an engaging young cast. It's different from what you would typically see and I enjoyed it quite a bit."

It is pretty much a bad film that has a good story and really bad special effects and ever worse actors which is a shame as it is a great idea and the result is a silly film that will be forgotten in some years as it has nothing special  Such a shame"

I actually remembered seeing this at the pictures. The robot scared me the most. A big hunk of metal with red eyes and a buzz saw for a hand, who is played by the guy who voices Yoda. What's not to be scared about."

      "text": "I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this movie when I first started watching it. I just knew it was a fantasy film with familiar content, and I was pleasantly surprised by it's quality. It's a kind of space \"Jumanji\" in which two brothers, with unresolved household disputes, will play a game that will prove to be a huge space adventure where anything can happen. I liked the way the film seeks to convey a moral of the story, focusing on the importance of brotherly love and the family. Jonah Bobo and Josh Hutcherson were very good at leading roles but the building of their characters was essential, allowing the public, especially the younger ones, to identify with one or the other. Kristen Stewart wasn't as effective as the self-centered, egocentric older sister, but she did provide a few moments of humor. Dax Sheppard was excellent and his performance gave this film its most emotional moments. Last but not least, the very good special effects that the film used, convincing yet discreet enough not to dominate the screen. Still a word to praise the good soundtrack, very competent in her role.In short: this film is excellent, although not very original and recycle the formula already used in another film. It will please easily at any age and is perfect for a family serenade with everyone in the room together watching and spending quality time together. After all, family is just that ... union."

      "text": "After the past comes the future, after The Flintstones came The Jetsons, and after Jumanji came this. Both Zathura and Jumanji were based on children's books by Polar Express author Chris Van Allsburg, who exploits opposite ends of the same premise: kids get sucked into an unfamiliar, potentially deadly world or universe by playing a mysterious, old-school board game. But while Jumanji was a rather nasty piece of work that relied all too heavily on its unconvincing special effects, Zathura is a surprisingly effective entertainment. Perhaps the director made the difference: Jumanji helmsman Joe Johnston specializes almost exclusively in SFX films (The Rocketeer, Jurassic Park 3) while Zathura's Jon Favreau is first and foremost an actor, which (along with this film's modest budget) allows him to focus on characterizations as he tells the story of two bickering brothers (Jonah Bobo and Josh Hutcherson) who learn some valuable Life Lessons as the game literally whisks them and their house into outer space, where they're forced to do battle with meteors and Zorgons. Favreau makes excellent visual use of light and darkness in building tension and suspense, gets a hilarious performance from Dax Sheppard, who both channels and parodies a slightly dissipated Harrison Ford as a stranded astronaut the boys encounter, and benefits from a solid script that plays fair with the audience as it plants seemingly insignificant clues and plot details that later bloom with some very surprising and satisfying payoffs. Minus points, however, go to Zathura for its noticeable strain of sexism; we see the boys' father (Tim Robbins) but never his mother (which makes the film's choice of golden oldie for its closing credits theme both peculiar and puzzling), and their big sister is depicted as a clueless, boy-crazy ninny who, in the script's one unconvincing aspect, is kept out of the loop as much as can be gotten away with. Nevertheless, Zathura is a witty, diverting thrill ride for audiences of all ages...and if you want evidence to convince your kids that board games are way cooler than video games, it's the perfect audio-visual aid!"

What was Sony Pictures thinking ,having a never smiling six and ten year old uttering profanity and throwing in a non essential sister who only answer to her borther and sister's pleas is to strike them. Clearly the author must have come from a broken home (as did I) I suggest he grow up and get over it."

Shows there's hope for family films yet. Wish there were more ship battles, those were cool."

      "text": "When the eight-year-old kid calls his older brother a \"d---\", it's your right to be offended that such phallic slang should be uttered in a family film, or you can take it as a homage to \"E.T.\" when Elliot calls his brother \"penis breath\". And since screenwriter David Koepp has collaborated with Spielberg on \"Jurassic Park\", \"The Lost World\", & \"War of the Worlds\", the seemingly anachoristic word might be the case of a scribe chiding his boss for excising \"penis breath\" from the special edition of \"E.T.\" As the older sister, Kristen Stewart is not an adolescent who's desexualized and Disney-fied, which adds a little realism to counterbalance the preposterous notion that a house can fly. The referencing of a Catherine Hardwicke film is a funny aside Jon Favreau might've written-in to remind people that he used to be an indie guy. \"Zathura\" is watchable, largely because the actors aren't overwhelmed by special effects, but it would've been more fun to see Stewart \"hook-up\"."

It was entertaining, the only boring part being the unnecessary stealth/thriller scene aboard the \"Zorgon\"'s ship, but even that was necessary to offer some variety. I highly recommend this film. It's not just for family. In fact, I don't recommend this for younger children: in the first 5 minutes, an 8-year-old kid intentionally says the \"D-word\" (and that's not the end of the swearing)."

The Polar Express was a visionary adventure, and Jumanji, family fun. Zathura doesn't get to be as thrilling and masterful as the animated film by Robert Zemeckis, but innovates ingredients from Jumanji, while at the same time creating new ones. It is a movie of great adventure, infinite inventiveness, and a screenplay that will please anyone in the whole family. Jon Favreau has an unlimited supply of audacity and he applies every bit of that to Zathura"
