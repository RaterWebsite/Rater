One major factor being these inhabitants are farmers not fighters, few if any have been in combat making inexperience a deadly weapon. Emma Cullens\u2019 husband was murdered by one of Bogues\u2019 gangs, along with many others in the close knit community; her and friend Teddy Q ride to a nearby town searching for anyone that can help, here they find Sam Chrisholm the bounty hunter and immediately try enlist his help in gaining control of the beloved Rose Creek again. Initially Chrisholm denies the pair until he learns that Bogue is the man responsible. The trio begins enlisting a quite diverse group of gunslingers, gamblers, a knife artist, sharpshooters, a tracker, and indian and a mexican outlaw to take down Bogues\u2019 tyranny. There is never a dull moment from inlaid jokes, smart comments, and humour to intense battles, realistic situations, and the constant terror; whether you enjoy comedies, action-packed, or straight western The Magnificent Seven is sure to please.\rEvaluation\r\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the start I knew The Magnificent Seven was going to be well thought out, prepared and executed movie. While some movies begin slow and gradually lead up to the plot or piece by piece put together a long drawn out story line, this one hits you straight on in the first few scenes. I personally prefer this kind of movie because I feel it grabs your attention quickly and will continue to hold your attention for longer rather than dragging out the intro. I thoroughly enjoyed The Magnificent Seven from start to finish.\r Relation to Similar Cultural Artifacts\r\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Magnificent Seven 2016 version is actually a remake of the 1960 version directed by John Sturges and starring Yul Brynner, Eli Wallach, Steve McQueen, Horst Buchholz, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn, Brad Dexter, etc. While the 1960 versions is also a remake; It was reproduced based on the 1954 Samurai Seven directed by Akira Kurosawa starring Toshir\u00f4 Mifune, Takashi Shimura, and Keiko Tsushima.\r Getting Down To Business\rEntertaining 4/4\r\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I rated a perfect because I was wide-eyed the whole movie, was anticipating what would happen next with every new twist and turn of the plot, and I without a doubt would watch this movie again in a heartbeat. Although deemed a western, I believe The Magnificent Seven brought a new level of excitement to the table. Even when considering this movie a remake I believe the action was intriguing.\rScene Quality 3/4\r\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While analyzing the animation and scenes, I thought the scenes were very well thought out and decorated. The one low point in the scenes was when the church was shown after being torched; this was while Sam Chisholm rode into town. I thought the church was lacking when it came to the burnt look but other than that all else seemed well-executed.\rActors\u2019 Performance 4/4\r\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One huge aspect to look into is the quality of the actors and how well they play the role. Not once did I find a actor breaking character, they were believable being so heartfelt and dedicated to making the movie seem real. The level of experience in this cast was extreme looking at Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Haley Bennett being just a few of the main characters you can imagine that this crew can and will excel.\rPlot 4/4\r\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not once did I find myself wonder what the plot was actually supposed to be. I followed the timeline easily and not once was I confused about what the final goal was; that being the reason why I rate the plot as perfect.\rIntensity 4/4\r\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Magnificent Seven was nothing short of intense, with the man to man combat, western gunfights, and hidden surprises. The addition of the background soundtrack adds even more effect making the experience all the more life-like.\rThe Little Things 4/4\r\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While easily overlooked the small things in all movies make them all the more solid and interesting. The Magnificent Seven is not lacking here; while a major detail is the color of the horses. For each of the seven men their horses are all a different color or shade of brown. Furthermore each horse matches the riders\u2019 clothing color. Looking at Sam Chisholm dressed in all black atop a black horse, Josh Faraday clothed in a dark brown leather riding a dark brown horse, Billy Rocks rides a chestnut colored horse that matches his gun holster, Jack Hornes\u2019 vest and hat matches the brown horse he is atop, Red Harvest is masked with the same war paint his horse is, the others follow in the same pattern. I easily rate the details a 4/4 in The Magnificent Seven.\r\u00a0\rFinal Tally 23/24\rPS. THIS WAS FOR A CLASS GRADE!"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Not a great movie but it is fun to watch.

Therefore, I went into this remake pretty cold for the most part. And while I can say that it was certainly entertaining in some aspects, story-wise, it was simply lacking in this department. All of the action and shootouts are stuffed into the first and third acts of the film while the entire middle act is spent setting up the final battle and events of the third act, which I didn't appreciate very much. And like I said, while the film managed to remain pretty entertaining for the most part with the shootouts, it eventually all began to feel rather scattershot and choppy in the final battle. Acting was meh. Honestly it felt as though the actors portraying the seven titular protagonists were somewhat wasted and weren't really given their full potential (Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, etc have all certainly been and can do better.) Overall, it's not without it's fair share of fun moments and action. However, the fact that it's all crammed into the first and third acts of the film that leaves an overly long setup for the rather hollow-feeling middle act as well as the subpar performances from a solid cast with far more potential makes this one questionable. However, if anything, it also makes me feel somewhat compelled to go home and watch the original, which from what I hear unsurprisingly is supposed to be a lot better than this."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Sleek outside but slight inside, Antoine Fuqua's entertaining second remake of 'Seven Samurai' settles for a by-the-numbers Western shoot-em-up storyline instead of expanding upon the two films it remakes, although the cast is impressive and they perform well. 5.5/10"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Unnecessary remake. It brings nothing interesting to the table and it a pure money grab. I don't mind remakes if they try to bring something new to the table like good humor or new twists but this one is pretty straight forward and honestly, there is no reason for it since the original movie was already good. The Seven Samurai remains the best of the pack and if your brain is too weak to enjoy subtitles then even the old 1960 western remake was ok (I forget what its called). Anyway, if you are young and have never seen the originals then this might be an ok film but honestly the bad guys were a weak point in this one. They were not intimidating nor intelligent which really brought down the story. In the original film, the village was facing an indomitable foe since it took place in a time of turmoil. The original foe did not select the village specifically rather the bad guys were more like a wave sweeping the country and that made them much more intimidating that some band of morons who follow a megalomaniac.

Its theme has been copied one way or another in many subsequent films. However, the movie itself is vastly overrated.  I defy anyone, who has never seen it, to view that movie without thinking how grossly outdated the acting, writing and directing is. Moreover, \"Seven Samurai\" lacks realism and common sense. Plus, the action scenes are some of the worse battles scenes in cinema history. The battle scenes are basically bad guys charging through the streets for a minute or two and then retreating. We barely get to see the seven samurai show their stuff. The 1960 version of \"The Magnificent Seven\", which I have seen 4 or 5 times, has an outstanding cast (Yul Brenner, Steve McQueen) and a great musical score, but this version of the story also makes no sense. It too suffers from being extremely dated. While watching the 1960 version, I kept thinking over and over, why would they all risk their lives for total strangers. The answers were never given.  Without plausible motivations, I couldn't believe what I saw on screen. Thus the 1960 version is also overrated. I think both movies are considered classics simply because they have a reputation for being classics. The 2016 version has upgraded special effects and enough action to keep the audience awake, but, just like the previous two versions, this movie lakes common sense and realism. The bad guys are some of the worse hired gunslingers in the history of American Westerns. They drop like flies. And though we eventually understand Denzel's motivation for defending the villagers, we don't quite see what motivates the other 6.

Predictable to its core, director Antoine Fuqua tries to valiantly cram every action cliche into a single film and the end result is a cliche film. Job well done, good sir. I never really ever rated Fuqua as a director. Training Day is a one off hit. Otherwise, he just directs safe, Hollywood, and bland action movies. This film is no exception with its problems only exacerbated by an iffy cast. Before I speak further on the film, I should first confess a major sin. As God is a major part of this film, I feel as though it is still pertinent. I...I...I have never seen Seven Samurai or the original The Magnificent Seven. I know. I would not like me either. Anyways, pressing on...\r The film's predictability comes from the very first shot. Throughout, the film is not just predictable because it is a remake (recall how I have never seen the originals), but also because you can sit there and just guess where each scene is going. What is worse is that the lazy writing carries onto the characters with skin deep character development at best. This development does not help to actually differentiate characters in the least. I honestly kept forgetting their names and mixing up who they are throughout the film. I knew that Red Harvest was the Native American, but I mean, that is because his name is Red Harvest. Hard to think that Denzel would be Red Harvest (I guess I should not say that, since Johnny Depp was Tonto...). Even worse from a character development standpoint is Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett). Okay, low-rent Jennifer Lawrence cannot act. She is not horrible, but I have yet to see any reason to cast her other than her resemblance to Lawrence. Yet, here, she plays a character that could have been a strong female character. Instead, her role disintegrates into being nothing more than a sexual object for us to ogle at thanks to frequent low-cut costumes and constant jokes about having sex with her and how she is pretty. The film can barely go 10 minutes without reminding us Emma's real role in the film: to be sexualized and objectified. How could I ever dream of forgetting such a key element of the film? Emma's role, in spite of the conclusion, continues to marginalized as she can never do anything for herself. Instead, she finds herself in the midst of gunfights and failing to defend herself. Rather, a man must come to her aid at every turn. What a missed opportunity here.\r Yet, as mentioned, Bennett is nothing to write home about in the acting department. The rest of the cast is equally mediocre. Denzel and Ethan Hawke are fine. Not career-best work by either, but they are okay. Chris Pratt has nothing charisma and abs going in his favor. As an actor, he is the definition of safe and bleh. That said, Byung-hun Lee and Martin Sensmeier were the real standouts. If the film was just Billy Rocks (Lee) stabbing people and throwing knives at them with Red Harvest (Sensmeier) sniping them with arrows, I would be a satisfied customer. Instead, they are bit players at best. Manuel Garcia-Rulfo is fine, though the butt of numerous offensive Mexican jokes, which further highlights the lazy writing. Finally, Vincent D'Onofrio was abysmal. It is like he had a frog caught in his throat and had to fight against said frog with all his might to utter a single line. Please spare me.\r As for the action, it is well done. The most entertaining part for sure. Yet, the in-between moments are so non-descript, slow, and shallow, it is hard to be entertained by the action. Instead, you are more-or-less relieved that film decided to try and do something again. I am a big fan of westerns (though I need to see more) and would love for a revival to happen. This film is not that revival. Instead, it just tediously moves along until Fuqua decides to let us get back to the good bits again with Denzel capping dudes left and right with his team by his side. In saying this, however, the action sequences are far too long and equally predictable, pulling out every cliche in the book (especially Pratt at the end, as well as the ending with Bennett).\r The sole positive that elevates this film to being just mediocre is the cinematography and scenery. I love gawdy shots of the country side with the sun setting. The Magnificent Seven has them in spades. Yet, the film does not stop there with beautiful long shots of cowboys riding in the distance and silhouetted cowboys against the sun in the background. The end result is truly gorgeous imagery. The peak of this imagery comes at the end of the film, however, particularly a shot of Denzel silhouetted against the bright sun to his left (in the image) as he walks out of a building. Another highlight coming shortly after that with Denzel and Bennett in the church with the light pouring in through the windows. Big pluses, really.\r As a whole, The Magnificent Seven is just really, really boring. Like, I am not a huge action guy, but damn. Nobody seems to have fun."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The new seven, all unique and diversified!Basically, people watch it for either those actors and the director or for an entertertainment.

Not much change in the theme, except the screenplay was little altered, especially diversity in the film characters and their developments. Because nowadays that's a big issue in Hollywood cinema.

I understand that there is a time limit, but felt like the characters weren't given their just dues in development.  I felt like the first part of the movie was boring and somewhat lackluster when it was introducing us to each member of the Magnificent Seven.

Peter Sarsgaard as the villain Bartholomew Bogue was well cast and one we hated, but again he could have been developed even more into one of the best vilians of all time-another lost opportunity for me.  So many times in the movie it lost out to the original.

I thought the tricks and surprises to cut down the enemies was brilliant, the teaching of the townspeople how to fight was humorous too.  In the end the story gave a little more light to the characters, but still think it could have given us so much more!

Pazolatto and Wenk also manage to put some humor in some parts.\r The screenplay smartly deliver us the story of a group of men that some of them with background that give them enough emotional reason to kill each other, e.g John Horne (ex Indian Hunter), Red Harvest (Indian Comanche), Faraday (his grandfather killed by Mexican gang), Vasquez (his grandfather was a member of Mexican gang that ambush Faraday's grandfather's town), but they bound together with one purpose, a noble purpose.Why?Cauze for another 5 men (beside Chisolm and Red Harvest) each of them have they own past to reconcile with, wanna make piece to their own soul before the next battle that could be their last one by take the impossible job. But off course the the last tiny element of surprise from Chisolm about his personal agenda, he has his very own personal reason why he finally take this job, that left me a question : Maybe this one flaw on this Mag7? Why? Because, why Chisolm rejected the offering from Emma, and declared that he himself is not for sale.but then he take the job when he found Emma will pay him - even all at once- with everything she got. Or maybe is just Chisolm eager to know how far would this widow go to seek righteousness or even revenge?If she would go a long the way, then Chisolm had a good reason to recruit the men he need.\r This Mag7 only give as much as a glance of each person's historical background, through their dialogues. Except for Robicheaux, this character get a little more exposed and curiousity what the hell happen to him after North and South war that make him hate himself so much after all act that he has committed during North and South war, that make him a very flimsy man.\rDenzel is really perform great his character cool bad ass, while Pratt represent enthusiasm and the spirit of this movie. Ethan Hawke (this is the 2nd time he team up with both Denzel and Fuqua) gave audiences skepticism about what will happen to this team. The rest of the cast, even didn't get portion as much as Denzel (off course, he is the man) or Ethan Hawke and Pratt - especially Martin Sensmier get the smallest portion - but they're all represent an assembled excellent marksmen (some og them have hororable dirty little secrets) to march as one into a battle for one descent good noble cause. Haley Bennet performances represent as young widow search for the last hope and an attitude to face all odds at all cost for he igdinity since her husband gunned down in coldblood by Bouge (Saargards appearance really gives the impression as the sick man). I also give credit to the cinematography that shots all gunfight scenes so perfectly, how Mauro Fiore took the angle to describe the savarage of Bouge's gold minning from distance.\r Fuqua's Mag7 is not one of classical western movie, but It's superbly done...and magnificently delivered to us, magically entertaining from beginning till end. Even though this movie might don't have what all critics wants to be as classical but still will be remembered as one of the most entertaining,enjoyable western.. Really as the quotes of the dialogues between Chisolm and Robicheaux \"What we lost in the fire, we found in the ashes\""}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Had this been a new western, rather than a remake of an awesome remake of a classic, I'd give it a 3.\r I loved the original remake & thought the new trailer was great, so admittedly went in with high expectations, especially with Denzel Washington playing the legendary Yul Brenner.\r The beginning is horrible and the first hour is plain bad. The first action scene as seen in the trailer, is such a letdown, with no rhyme, reason or continuity. They throw in some corny bones of the original remake, including a few verbatim lines.\r Denzel was okay, but far from his best work. Vincent D'Onofrio is mildly amusing, very entertaining & quite likable as Jack Horne. Byung-hun Lee rocks as Billy Rocks and I would liked to have seen & heard more of/from him. Martin Sensmeier as Red Harvest was awesome but an important fight scene with him near the end, fell short & flat. The best actor/character in the film is Haley Bennett as the heroine, Emma Cullen! Funny thing is, the very best part of the film is her narration at the very end. I think it was the only time I smiled during the boringly long film which could have been done just as poorly in 90 minutes.\r Someone in the discussion boards talks about the painful PC diversity, and I would normally agree, but in this case, it actually worked and made a terrible film, a little more interesting. The commenter quips that only a little person was missing, but there actually is one and chose him to mock on several occasions. I guess little people aren't high on the SJW's list of victim class.\r I had to see it but would much rather have seen The Hateful Eight again instead and even went back and gave that movie an extra star. The Magnificent Seven needed the Tarantino touch and some blood. For all the killing, I don't remember seeing a drop, though maybe I just blinked through them. Then again, They can get a pass because there wasn't much blood used in old time westerns and they probably saved millions on spectacular special effects, or the lack thereof.\r This movie is SO bad, that I did something I never do at the movies, got up & went to the bathroom to be comfortable in my boredom, without even asking my friend what I missed, because I didn't care. I didn't really bond with the characters, except my concern for the horses, imagining as I always do in movies, the suffering these poor creatures went through during times of war & battle.\r This expensive movie will make money on the back of the original remake, and I'm sure they paid a fortune for the right to butcher it. I'd really like to know exactly what they did pay for the rights.\r I recommend you wait until it's on cable and have 2+ hours to waste."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Antoine Fuqua continues to demonstrate his utter dominance over the genre filmmaking craft with \"The Magnificent Seven,\" an invigorating western with enough respect for the original to get even the most fervent remake-haters on board for the ride.

The actors are pretty decent, the plot moves at a decent place and the action scenes are very good, plus it does a decent job juggling the characters even though a few don\u2019t get the necessary screen time they need.  The film is held back by a really weak villain and a second half that really doesn\u2019t match the tone of the first.  I prefer it to the 1960 version because it has a bit more fun and it has fixed a lot of the pacing issues and dropped a lot of the un-necessary sub plots from the original but I would be lying if I said I thought this was a great movie.  The first half is genuinely fun and I did enjoy myself watching the film but I am not sure I can entirely recommend it, I don\u2019t think there is enough for fans of the old film to latch on to and I think they will be disappointed by the newer elements bought into the film and I don\u2019t think a younger audience will connect with it as the producers want them to.  I suspect this film will find an audience and it is a decent attempt at a remake but I think it needed a little bit more.

A new low is upon us in not only movie making but for the western genre. I strongly recommend that Mr. Fuqua, the director take this film off his resume. It takes away from all his good work. Denzel? What in the world were you thinking as well as Ethan Hawke and all the rest of the cast. First of all, just go see the original and anyone who does will immediately come to their senses with little of no effort and understand without explanation how good a Western can be. You will probably watch it twice as I have seen it maybe 30 times. That is where the word \"magnificent\" belongs and not in this remake in any way. Mass random shootings & killings with might makes right is not suspense or good story-telling. This movie came across as hollow and plastic for script, acting and plot. This is movie is like a video game of some sort where you get to pick a character and then kill as many people as you can. Mindless in presentation, severe lack of character development, egotistical parading of look at me I am in a Western and riding a horse and shooting guns is more of a display of embarrassment that I had for all the people in this movie. Here's an interesting thought. Why didn't all these folks just get together and make a movie any movie? Calling this a remake? I am surprised that critics are not all over this and telling the truth about how bad it is. Methinks the fix is in. All I can say is that if anyone likes this type of Western portrayed here, in this way and style, The Western as we know it is doomed at least for this generation. Shame on everyone in this movie for charging money to go see this. A refund is in order for all plus an apology.

The movie in my opinion was simply entertaining, the cast seemed to enjoy their respective roles and the simply story was obvious but not overbearing. My wife who I can count on for at least two or three sleep nods during our date night movies was full on engaged clutching my arm intently during the entire movie. She never realized the movie was just over 2 hours, it was a obvious emotional end.

Do not watch."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This remake of a remake tells the time honored tale of a few brave men rising up to defend the weak and oppressed, and again shows us the conflict we've seen many times before, in which, the skilled few stand u to the oppressive many.\r The Magnificent 7 establishes its setting in perfect fashion, thrusting us into a heated town meeting. Then suddenly, the villain enters, his menacing footsteps thump and creak on the wood floor, disagreement ensues, and suddenly, a shot splits the air. Such a startling sound, that you never really get used to, despite the amount of lead that flies here. The Western atmosphere is perfectly recreated and though it is that much more real, due to improved technology, it feels familiar in a way. Strains, variations, and melodic teases of Elmer Bernstein's famous score riddle the film and keep the mood adventurous.\r The obvious dominant component of the film, its action scenes are epic, and gripping. There are of course plenty of scenes that any western worth its salt is simply required to feature. Several Mexican standoffs, so delightfully stereotypical, as well as quite a few things that are new, or have not been seen for a while. A duel between two Comanches, a fighting force seeking shelter from the mighty Gatling gun, and a cowboy lighting dynamite with a cigarette as he lays dying all come to mind. I could go on for much longer about how ridiculously cool this movie's action sequences are, but I'll let you see for yourself.\r Finally, the plot, though anything but unfamiliar is a moving and epic tale about unity, loyalty, and grit. One of my favorite scenes in the movie features Jack Horne, the tracker, played by Vincent D'onofrio, (who like the rest of this all star cast is just downright amazing in a role that fits like a glove) shot by an enemy arrow. He falters, but stares at the enemy and rises. He takes a step forward, and is stopped again, a second shaft protruding from his chest. He continues his advance toward the enemy until he can no longer, dying with his dignity intact.\r The Magnificent Seven is a film that is so clich\u00e9d that it begins to feel original. And That is definitely a compliment. Not that there is anything wrong with modern westerns that try something new, like Django, or No Country For Old Men, but It is certainly a joy to watch a movie that owns these tropes for what they are, tosses some satisfying character development into the mix, and makes something out of it that is, for lack of a better adjective, positively \"Magnificent\"."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "The opening massacre is the most violently shocking moment in this film. It's also the catalyst for the small town to hire the titular gang to defend them from the perpetrator (Peter Sarsgaard). They start with Denzel Washington, who sets out to assemble his team, which includes a wise-cracking Chris Pratt and a rainbow of ethnicities. Most don't have much personality, but neither does the movie. With a re-imagining, you'd expect a stepped-up approach. Instead, it's a mostly somber drama with lots of serious posturing (and not much emotion). While copious bullets fly in the final showdown, not much of the action is original or even interesting. Without advancing the genre in any way, it's still an adequate Western."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "It's an exciting western with modern day flourishes. It's shootouts are big, flashy, and all very exciting. The strength of the movie though comes from it's characters. They are wonderfully acted and likable in their own ways.Most of the attention does go to Denzel and Pratt, but Fuqua makes sure the rest of the talented people onscreen don't go by unnoticed. Each member of the seven has their presence felt throughout. The biggest surprise onscreen has to be Vincent D'Onofrio who proves to be a fantastic character actor. The camaraderie between the cast adds a little heart to the experience and gives the battles more weight.The one area where The Magnificent Seven stumbles is with it's plot and main villain. The writing is fine, it's just the setup isn't very original. I'm aware this is a remake so it's likely just following the source material, but that doesn't change the fact that this sort of thing has been done to death at this point. Then there's Peter Sarsgaard. Or rather there isn't Peter Sarsgaard. He barely has any screen time or presence in a movie where he's the big bad guy. Kind of disappointing.When all is said and done though, The Magnificent Seven is no less exciting or well-cast.

The story is kind of bland though and doesn't really capture the magic of the original film or Seven Samurai, which the original film was based off.\r Overall, I liked it enough to not hate it.

As with most film\u2019s one starts watching optimistically, but after a promising but tried and trusted set up one begins to lose interest as Denzel Washington goes off in search of the other titular six. From here on in there really is not much here to pique the imagination. The film drags on for a good hour before finally letting rip with a half hour battle to save the town that is truly exciting and very well staged. The cinematography is the true star and the locations are breathtakingly gorgeous, but the music, half of which is credited to the late James Horner, is inappropriate and lacking strength for such a testosterone fuelled movie. It\u2019s a pretty score, signature Horner in fact, and unobtrusive but it just seems out of place here. The film also would seem to have no right to its title being far from magnificent in its scripted characters. It is actually a misnomer. These characters don\u2019t display anything resembling magnificence, a few of them even ending up as corpses.

Most often than not, that is not an issue for me, but there was barely a scene here which you could not predict how it would play out 2 minutes in advance.
