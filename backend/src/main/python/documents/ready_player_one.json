The picture plays like a glitzy, nostalgic stroll down an '80s version of memory lane, chock full of nonstop references to the decade's movies. music and memes (in itself an odd fascination for characters in a story set in 2045). What's worse, the film lacks a fundamentally compelling story and takes about 45 minutes too long to get to a central message that becomes patently obvious early on in the picture. If you're looking for purely mindless entertainment, you'll probably find this moderately amusing, but, if you want something more substantive, skip this one and watch one of the filmmaker's earlier (and much better) offerings."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This movie does a great job of capturing the feelings and emotions as well as the aspirations of any VR gamer.

Unfortunately the movie was a huge disappointment.  The tone of movie is inconsistent, sometimes it's very real and at other times it's completely contrived and fairy tale.  In the end it seems like it was targeted for 12 year olds.  Some of the scenes work and others fall flat.  The humor never really connects and feels forced.

It's nice to see all the references that are put in the film, whether they are in plain sight, or more obscure. The film is also beautiful with amazing CGI and special effects. The film is quite funny too, with a lot of clever jokes. However, the characters are fine, save for a few of them, but there is little to feel for these characters as the story arcs are kind of generic. Perhaps the biggest flaw comes from the pacing; often it feels like the film makers were trying to cram too much into the film at times. Nonetheless, Ready Player One is a great film from start to finish and I would definitely recommend seeing it."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Not all adaptations are true to the original text as books and movies are different beasts, however you do expect the core of the book to intact, and the characters done justice. Unfortunately Spielberg has not done that, the story is diluted and weak, the characters paper thin with no depth. For all the special effects (which are great) and the cinematography (fantastic), it does not help hold the film to greatness. It's a shame since they spent alot of time and energy getting the rights for so many IPs into this film and if you had a remote and a copy of the film, you could pause it and check out every single easter egg and name every single character they have squeezed in, but that would mean watching this again, which is simply not happening.Stick to the book. It's fantastic, and really captures what it means to gamers to be part of the game."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "If Ready Player One isn't the type of adventure you're looking for, then I guarantee you I don't even know what is. With a load of cameos ready to be seen and references ready to be heard and being a huge improvement over the 2011 novel, Ready Player One is guaranteed to bring anyone who are fans of at least one of the many cameos and references this film holds. What I like about this film is that its plot only relies on Easter eggs similar to how the novel relied on Easter eggs, but intends to go more modern than what you only see in the novel. Steven Spielberg might as well be known for directing well-loved classics, but he's also the same guy who also directed modern art like The BFG and this film.

What is annoying is that the  changes seem intended to give Artemis a kick-ass girl-power role.

If you're not a gaming or anything 80's fan miss this movie as you'll probably give it a negative review.The main problem i keep reading in reviews is, that wasn't put in and this wasn't put in the film. What people have to understand using characters in a book is totally different than in a movie, their things called licences which cost a ton of money and with this movie costing 175 million to make as it is, how much more needs to be spent to make everyone happy. Does everyone really think Blizzard let Spielberg use Tracer and D Va for free, plus all the other licences which were needed just to make this.People seriously need to get a grip and review this movie as a movie and not as a bookSo back to the review. The acting was hit and miss, some of the acting was great and some really didn't suit the character. visually it was epic and just sitting there trying to spot nostalgic characters, movies and games from the 80's and upwards made it even more enjoyable, I think i spent most of the movie saying \"oh looks it's\".Overall - Yes the book is better, but when have we ever seen an identical port from book to film.

It has received somewhat \"mixed\" reviews from the critics, but you got to have at least some knowledge of what videogames are to completely understand and appreciate it, and that's precisely what some critics lack. Besides that, it is a great experience, spectacular, funny and entertaining so for me it's a must see, and even a must-rewatch, as someone else has already said."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Putting aside my book bias and evaluating the movie on its own merits, it's simply mediocre and forgettable. The world building is limited to the first 5 minutes of the film where Wade (aka Parzival) narrates an introduction to the viewers. It doesn't adequately explain WHY the real world has become so lousy that everyone wants to escape to the OASIS, merely that the OASIS has become the preferred escapism drug of the masses. No attempt is made to tie in the constant 80's references, leaving the viewer to wonder why kids in 2045 would give a damn about John Hughes or Twisted Sister. All we're really told is that the real world sucks, everyone loves the OASIS, and that if the Big Bad\u2122 IOI and Sorrento win the late James Halladay's easter egg hunt the OASIS will become as lousy as the real world. So players like Wade and his best friend Aech are on a quest to win the hunt and save the OASIS from IOI's corporate oppression.Literally a few minutes later, we're introduced to Art3mis and the movie shifts entirely in tone. Art3mis is originally presented to the audience as a strong character who is apparently well known within the OASIS as one of the top Egg Hunters -- Gunters, in the parlance of the movie and book -- and Parzival is immediately smitten with her despite only seeing her avatar on Kaira's bike from AKIRA. At this point the movie becomes a cliche teen love, \"get the girl\" movie. Parzival still cares about the OASIS but only in the context of his relationship with Art3mis.In the real world, Art3mis (aka Samantha Cook) is portrayed as a member of some rebellion group who has at least one shadow operative working behind the scenes. Yet barely an hour after being introduced to Art3mis as a strong character with an axe to grind against IOI (and 10 minutes after meeting her in the real), Art3mis' character is turned into a shrinking violet who defers to Parzival and even sacrifices herself to the very thing that she was fighting against in order to save Wade in the real. This, of course, sets up the final conflict which becomes more about saving Art3mis than saving the OASIS. Parzival trashing IOI and bringing down Sorrento is a bonus but the real reason he feels he has to win the Easter Egg hunt is to rescue his love interest from the clutches of IOI.The other three members of the high five - Aech (Parzival's best friend ever), Daito, and Sho - are all given short shrift. They are paper thin characters both in the OASIS and in the real. Aech is the most prominent but Aech's role devolves into mid-movie comic relief and late movie chauffeur. Daito and Sho are practically afterthoughts.The movie bombards the viewer with CGI special effects and nostalgia bombs. It's worth noting, however, that a good 90 percent of the nostalgia and in-movie pop culture references were in the trailers. If you've seen the reveal trailer, the second trailer, and the final trailer you've seen almost all of the references. There's only three sections not shown in the trailers with a handful of references. The high point of the nostalgia trip is the second key challenge within a recreation of Stanley Kubrick's \"The Shining\". As an aside, I couldn't help but wonder why, in this universe, video gaming development died circa 2017 -- where everyone is still playing Overwatch, Borderlands, Halo, and DOOM 30+ years later. It's as if the OASIS came out and game developers just gave up. Since the movie doesn't take the time to really explain WHY these old franchises and 80's nostalgia are so prevalent, it feels shoehorned in and makes very little sense.Nostalgia alone is why this movie is getting high ratings by viewers. Take off the nostalgia goggles and evaluate the movie for the story it tells and how it tells it. It wants to be a nostalgia driven, young adult dystopia movie like Hunger Games or Maze Runner but lacks the story chops to pull it off and relies on CGI as glue to hold together the weak narrative. Bear in mind that this is just a view of the movie on its own merits. If I really wanted to do a deep dive comparing it to the book, well, that would take far too long. Suffice to say, if you liked the book and are expecting the book, you'll be disappointed. Especially if you're a fan of Ogden Morrow's character from the book."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I first want to start off by saying that I had no idea this was based off a book until after I got home from seeing this and read some other users' reviews on this, many of whom had read the book claimed that this film wasn't as good as the book.

Directed by Steven Spielberg - at 71 years old - he shows that he hasn't lost any of that old magic. He returns to thrilling sci-fi adventures where a group of young kids explore a world of wonder and endless possibilities. The year is 2045, and like most recent Hollywood blockbusters, the future is doomed. We meet a young boy named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan), he says his name is like that because his deceased father thought it would be like a cool superhero name like \"Peter Parker\" and \"Bruce Banner\" (and the references don't stop there). Due to society being so stricken and misery populating the world, he often escapes into the virtual reality world known as \"The Oasis\". The VR goggles enter him into his Avatar named \"Parzival\", and the world of the Oasis is absolutely crafted in such a stunning way, you feel immersed and almost lost in its universe. The great mind behind the virtual world of the Oasis is James Halliday (Mark Rylance), who developed this feature over a decade before, to stop people from focusing too much on the harsh and economically struck reality, and escape to a world where they can feel free to be whatever they want. However, since Halliday died a few years back, he posted a video stating that he has left an Easter Egg somewhere deep within the Oasis, and that there are three keys to collect, in order to retrieve the egg. It's a race, and everyone begins to compete. And it is there that we meet our main antagonist of the film, Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn) who wants the egg for himself so that the Oasis can belong to him. And he will stop at nothing to make sure that he gets there first. Spielberg adapts this novel from Ernest Cline and uses many of the pop-culture references well... from \"Back to the Future\", \"King Kong\" to \"The Iron Giant\", they're all in there for a reason. Not to add to our nostalgic enjoyment. This is Steven Spielberg's most exciting adventure since 'Minority Report' (2002), it's fast, always moving, and you're never bored watching it. I felt like a child again watching this movie as it's been so long since Spielberg has made a blockbuster movie. Yes, I absolutely loved 'Lincoln' (2012) as well as 'Bridge of Spies' (2015), but 'Ready Player One' is what Spielberg used to be, and he should continue to make more films like this.

The actors are never given space to breathe, the character development is paper-thin, and every performance is therefore hackneyed to the point of cringeworthiness.
