      "text": "This is B movie material that doesn\u2019t go anywhere. The setting is the only thing going for this movie that never really comes together. Even that falls flat as it is just left as a backdrop from the really strange setup to why the main character ends up there in the first place. The small cast does fine in their roles, but the choices made for exposition and who/how it\u2019s delivered is almost hilarious. I can\u2019t say that this falls into the \u201cso bad it\u2019s good\u201d category either. There\u2019s really not much mystery left of what\u2019s happening on the island, yet much is let to the viewers imagination. Once the initial intrigue wears off and the plot is spoon feed to you your left with the decision of weather or not a nap might have been a better choice then to continue to watch this movie. I did both."

      "text": "Blumhouse produced this nifty teen version of Predator. It centers around a young man who goes on a sort of survival retreat after his father is murdered. After arriving solo he soon discovers hes not alone. He gathers up his strength to try and survive until the boat comes back. It's a suspenseful little horror flick even though it's a bit underdeveloped. More character and story work would have really hit the concept home. All in all not a bad watch.6/10"

      "text": "Unfortunately, the film somehow didn't appeal to me the whole time. I liked the setting, but otherwise the film left me cold without much emotion. The characters didn't engage me. Not much of a story either. The action sequences were also not much. For me, this is an average film. I don't know who I would recommend this to. I would rather advise you to skip this film."
