If you like well-made, enjoyable movies that a treat to the mind, the heart and the soul, then this is the movie. If you like good acting, good story-telling and a glimpse of the what racial segregation used to be like, than this is your movie. The only reason I didn't give this a movie a 10 and gave it a 9 instead is, because at times the movie tries to hard. It didn't need to, but it's definitely worth seeing. Enjoy."

Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monae all give fine performances as the titular characters, as do Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Mahershala Ali, Jim Parsons, etc in supporting roles, but they simply can't help the film feel like nothing more than a predictable narrative and formula we've seen too many times before. I also honestly found the overall film, the score/music choice in particular very corny. Overall, it's definitely a feel-good film with an inspiring true story with some dedicated performances from great actors and actresses, but don't go in expecting anything extraordinary in terms of the inspiring true story subgenre."

It's a nice movie about race in America during the sixties and the space race that was of the same period.  It blends the two subjects perfectly."

They are pretty much cranked out 2-3 per year by formula these days.FYI: my uncle used to do ballistic calculations similar to those done by Katherine Johnson for a major defense firm. He said it was the most boring, mind-numbing job he'd ever had, \"basically like being a mathematics janitor\". You're mostly just checking and double-checking math results that an early (hence somewhat unreliable) computer spit out.Frankly movies like this do blacks a grave disservice, just like that one about the African \"math genius\" who in reality is a mediocre club-level player who peaked at age 19 and only won awards through affirmative action. Revisionist history might sell, but it won't actually enlighten people who are interested about the true history of race in America."

Having lived thru much of the actual history, I'm aware accuracy is of interest AND composing a Progressive myth, based on accurate history is high art.  The script has the good fortune of facts telling a story of the epic struggle of educated blacks to be accepted at NASA against the backdrop of more facts, the epic courage of the early American astronauts and NASA administrators.  The high point for me occurs when Kevin Costner takes a metal crowbar to the sign \"Colored's Bathroom\" with 15 colored women, the \"computers\" watching.  Wow.  Priceless mythmaking of the highest order, small personal acts of courage and justice demonstrating and highlighting more truly human values than the norms of mainstream culture.  The cast and direction is flawless in my humble opinion."

Today we talk about discrimination against women, though this film is an example that it all had started way long ago, yet the struggle has not ended. Anyway, this is a biopic, a biopic of three women and their struggle not just being a black, but being women. When the nation was eager to send its first man to the space, there was some trouble within the team who are behind it to work together as one. Lots of inspiring events reveal how the history was made and the working culture was changed forever inside the NASA.The film was nominated for the Oscars in the three slots, but did not win any. That's fine, because I would prefer those real women to be recognised over what this film had achieved. All the three actresses were good. Their roles were unique from one another. Really a wonder film about three real persons in one film. Something rare in films to highlight their achievements equally. The personal life, as well as their professional was well briefed.The others like Kevin and Dunst in small part were also good. Directed by just a one film old filmmaker. He did good. The screenplay was adapted from the book of the same name. Deserved all the awards and praises it had received. After seeing how it had ended, a sequel could be possible. Mission Moon. I hope they would consider it! Seems a nice idea!8/10"

Not common in films unfortunately. It\u00b4s woth the mention that the incredibly talented musician Janelle Monae makes a great debut in film with this one.

      "text": "Hidden Figures is a pretty by-the-numbers drama that I probably will forget existed in a few years, but it is worth a watch.Acting: Taraji P. Hensen was very good, but I'm not disappointed she didn't receive a best actress nomination. Janelle Monae was fine, but I still want her in more movies to see if she has a bit more range. I'm surprised Octavia Spencer was nominated for supporting actress, and she didn't even really do anything. She didn't have much of an Oscar scene and a very limited role in the entire film. I wouldn't say Monae deserves the nomination over her though, as Hensen was the main focus and had the largest role. Kevin Costner was a good pick for his role, and Jim Parsons was good. He basically acted like a calmer, less-funny, racist Sheldon from Big Bang Theory, but he was convincing enough. Plot: The movie is pretty by-the-numbers, not doing much to stand out. A movie like Jackie would definitely stay in my head longer than Hidden Figures. The cinematography is fine, the screenplay is fine; almost everything in this movie is simply \"fine.\" They didn't do anything wrong throughout, but nothing really new happened. I was afraid it would feel like a TV movie, as the trailers depicted it. At times it felt a bit reminiscent of a TV movie, but it definitely felt like a real, best-picture nomination deserving movie.Overall, Hidden Figures is a relatively simple movie that is worth your time, but don't expect it to be talked about or remembered too clearly in a few years."

This movie touched me in so many ways, and it made me feel like I could touch the moon. Being a woman in the business world, even today there are struggles we face, I couldn\u2019t imagine having been an African American woman in the 60\u2019s trying to get to the top. From the cast to the movie itself, everything was stellar, and probably the best movie I will see all year.The story centers around Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson; three African American women working at NASA, all with dreams of their own. Katherine is an amazing mathematician, Dorothy has dreams of being a supervisor, and Mary wants to be an engineer. Individually, they face seemingly impossible stepping stones in order to get to where they want to be. One by one, they start to see their dreams unfold before their eyes, all while watching the world change around them.I found myself relating so much to Taraji P. Henson\u2019s character so much. With my profound love for math, I know what it feels like to be a woman in a man\u2019s world, the story touched me and made me have a different level of respect for this woman. Janelle Monae\u2019s character Mary was a driven woman who would do whatever it took to reach her dream. She went before the court and had the most inspiring quote of the whole movie, which is the quote I used at the beginning of my review. We all know Octavia Simpson only plays characters who are as strong and beautiful as she is, her story touched me mostly because she never gave up, and she never let failure or a hard road dampen her dreams. These women are all someone I think we can aspire to be.The rest of the cast included Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons, Glen Powell, and so many more amazing actors. They all give stellar performances. The entire cast couldn\u2019t have been chosen better. The film stuck to the original story and the facts very well, which I appreciated. It\u2019s always good to enjoy a film, and learn a little bit about history as well. There\u2019s just something about a movie that makes you feel good and knowing that it\u2019s all true. It gives you hope that the world isn\u2019t as bad as you think it is.I know I didn\u2019t go too deep into the story with this one, but its all facts. You can read the book, you can look it up. Just know that this movie will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you feel good, and it will give you hope. It\u2019s a movie you can take the whole family to. I promise you won\u2019t regret seeing this, and even if you have to pat $15, its worth it. If for nothing else, the acting is the best you\u2019ll see in a film all year."

While, the racial and gender biases portrayed, obviously did exist in the 50\u2019s & 60\u2019s in some parts of the country, some were natural extensions of the societies that existed at the time (e.g. state of natural families and the roles of the members (fathers and mothers) of those families, gender roles of the time, etc.).

      "text": "Lord, let us give thanks for the miracle you have given us in your infinite wisdom, generosity, and mercy. Lord, thank you for blessing the world with Janelle Monae and her wide range of talents. For convincing her to act and pursue a career in Hollywood, we are unworthy of your bounty Lord, for we are but simple sinners, doomed to be imperfect. Yet, you have graced us with the sole being of perfection among us and for that, we are eternally grateful. Amen.Aside from Monae though, Hidden Figures is a pretty simple story. Telling the real life story of the black women who helped to put a man in orbit and land on the moon, it is an inspirational feel good story that is by-the-numbers. Shoving the story of these women into the feel good biopic cliches, Hidden Figures loses some of its impact as a result. Fortunately, feel good movies are always going to leave you with a goofy smile on your face after watching it and Hidden Figures fits the bill there. That said, do not expect it to be different from any other inspirational biopic you have ever seen.Blending in some light comedy to brighten the racial tensions of the story, the film actually does a solid job showing the racism the girls face working for NASA. The film really defines the racism in looks with the girls being stared down upon entering any room. Co-workers assume they cannot handle the work, only to be shown that they can. Yet, first impressions often define treatment and the women of Hidden Figures are never treated perfectly by co-workers. That said, as a PG-rated move, there are n-bombs here, which leaves the film to resort to subtle racism. Honestly, this works better for a film of this type as, by 1961, the tides were turning enough to force people to not be so overt and brash with their racism in the workplace. Hidden Figures really captures this with things still labeled as being for \"coloreds\" or the girls being excluded even when they should be filled in on the information. The film takes the same approach to sexism with people expressing obvious sexist thoughts that they are taken aback to learn are sexist. Towards the end of the film, Vivian Mitchell (Kirsten Dunst) tells Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) that she is not racist to which Dorothy tells her that she believes she thinks that is true about her, highlighting the subtly of the film with racism and sexist thoughts. The film clearly tries to bring them to the surface and does, but the racist and sexist actions of characters in the film are often done simply because it was the way things were and colored people or women doing these things was completely unprecedented.However, while the film largely handles the racism elements over it, it cannot help but burst into bombastic monologues about the ills of racism and the importance of overcoming it. These monologues are largely done by Katharine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) and Al Harrison (Kevin Costner). The director of the Space Task Group, Harrison lets the racism occur until Katharine informs him about it, at which point he puts an end to it. Clearly seen as a white savior of sorts for Katharine in particular, Harrison repeatedly makes large displays of inclusion, yet still excludes Katharine and kicks her out at the request of his superiors, in spite of her talents. He makes the most attempts of anybody to include her, but clearly does so begrudgingly. This does not stop the film, however, from using his character as a white savior to lend a helping hand to the disenfranchised among us. Returning to the original purpose of this paragraph, the film may do a good job at crafting the air of racism and sexism around of every turn. However, it lacks the subtly in its dialogue given to its black characters to really pull it off. As a result, the film plays out with Katharine just telling people off left and right. While she is correct and free to express her thoughts, it feels to in your face and overt. Maybe she was like, I do not know, but as a film, there are ways to show her fight back and prove them wrong without having to jump up in their face to do so.Of course, these emotional monologues only further serve to make the film feel conventional. What good is a feel good and inspirational film without moving speeches by the oppressed? Regardless of whether the real women were like this, the characters in the film are pigeon holed into a palatable package that will not offend white people like slave dramas often do. Instead, these stock characters allow white audiences to largely look past their race and have a good time anyways, even if all the white characters are portrayed as the evildoers they potentially were to some degree. That said, the rise, the breakthrough, the challenge at the end, the fall, and then the final ascension to praise, are all tried and true inspirational feel good biopic cliches. Director Theodore Melfi ensures that this film hits each beat on the nose."

      "text": "Fifty-six years ago, the first Black women came to work at NASA, a milestone during a time that in a way appears similar to our modern-day culture. Maybe there are no more Jim Crow segregation laws, but we still see Civil Rights protests by angry citizens flaunting picket signs, gender discrimination in the workforce, and consistent scientific breakthroughs from widely respected corporations. You might believe me when I say how very little has changed since then, as we are ultimately guilty of repeating the same mistakes, which the newest biopic, Hidden Figures, subtly proves to us.\u200bIt churns your stomach to remember the function of class relations in 1961: all colored people by law could only touch specially separated computers, bathrooms, and coffee stations labeled, \u201ccolored.\u201d The police also had the privilege to escort a Negro out of the library for setting foot in the \u201cWhite\u201d section. Unbelievably, these rules to living were active not too long ago. Yet these circumstances allow the delivery of an uplifting true story about man\u2019s historical progression and future potential.Three ladies of color are seen beside a nonfunctioning car in the Virginia countryside. So who else would come to ruin their day other than a stubborn police officer? It looks like a deep pit of doom until they suddenly get the car functioning again, and successfully convince the officer to escort them to their jobs at  NASA.One is sent to the other \u201ccolored\u201d workers in a separate room from the rest of the campus, one is left to work in the testing facility where the other men bully her, and one gets the worst of it\u2014she spends day and night working behind a desk, ruthlessly mistreated by everybody else. Her incredible knowledge in analytical geometry makes little difference; she still gets deliberately discriminated by her coworkers, and has no other options other than to race half a mile across campus to the nearest \u201ccolored\u201d bathroom whenever she needs to relieve herself.The cast and crew\u2019s hard work results in a loyal adaptation, both to the true story and to the Margot Lee Shetterly book it\u2019s based on. Educational facilities everywhere will benefit from its survey of the cultural influence on NASA during its early efforts of launching man into space. If that\u2019s not a landmark event in societal progression worth telling, then I don\u2019t know what is.Although beside the meticulous recreation of the Civil Rights era\u2019s segregation, the overall period setting offers nothing new to the cinematic experience. Director Theodore Melfi\u2019s direction brims in the epitome of generic: creating too squeaky-clean of an atmosphere in order to be the sole \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d Oscar buzz movie. The bright colors and made-for-television sets do not recreate the sickening feel of the era it attempts to establish. Although the period does get needed justice by showing a series of news footage from the time, the slightly-off-focus cinematography fails to craft the feel of immersion.The shifts in tone and character may feel a bit too sudden to produce any further realism in the environment, the overwhelmingly masculine society triggers a series of intriguing tests onto the three women. At home, one of them must act as both mommy and daddy to her three daughters, adding to her already boiling pressure. The challenges on and off the job never seem to quit, and the remarkable chemistry between the three leading ladies: Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e, halt any dull moments. Henson particularly deserves special recognition in her portrayal of an independent woman we want to succeed; her transparent discomfort comes across as all the White workers stop and stare at the color of her skin.While a picture about the Civil Rights era probably didn\u2019t need to dwindle its content down to a profitable PG-rating, the job still triumphs based on the difficult subject the cast and crew had to handle. In light of recent memories we have succumbed to throughout 2016, all of us: man and woman, dark or light, millennial and baby boomer, ought to use a high quality feel-good drama to look toward a brighter 2017."

This film tells the amazing story of 3 of these exceptional women (played by Octavia Spencer, Taraji P. Henson, Janelle Mon\u00e1e). The spunky script peppers the continuous indignities and inequities that are heaped upon them with humor that adds warmth and humanity. Their performances are all winning. This film is fascinating in its exploration the early history of our space program, but it also delves into the discrimination against these women in an easy to swallow, entertaining package. A few snappy songs by Pherrell Williams adds even more verve."

Henson, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Mon\u00e1e who are owning every scene. Also starring an agitated Kevin Costner who spends a good portion of the movie standing around chewing gum. But who cares about him, this movie is all about the women and the incredible work they did for NASA. The movie reels you in from the moment it starts, doesn't go over the top and keeps you invested in this extraordinary story. It's inspiring, it's funny and you'll definitely enjoy it. Recommended."

      "text": "Hidden Figures tells the real but unheralded story of three mathematicians, Katherine Goble Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae), whose work at the US Space Agency, NASA contributed significantly, to the success of America's space programme. The movie documents the struggles Johnson, Vaughan and Jackson had to go through in segregated America, compounded by discrimination against women, to get ahead in their chosen fields; Johnson, with a special mathematical talent, Vaughan with computing know-how and Jackson, a mathematician aspiring to be an Engineer. The story largely centres on Katherine Goble Johnson but Taraji P. Henson's portrayal does not quite drive the movie, only picking up at two points, when her character dramatically confronts Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) her boss at the NASA Division where she works, over segregation and a particularly symphonic scene where she engages in solving a complex mathematical problem on a chalk board. It is three members of the supporting cast that keep this movie humming along very nicely, for its duration; Costner who puts in an effortless performance as Al Harrison, director of the Space Task Group assigned the responsibility of putting a man into orbit, Janelle Monae who deserves applause for her virtuoso performance as Mary Jackson and Academy Award Winner, Octavia Spencer (The Help), present as a reassuring, steadying hand. This is a beautifully filmed movie with an engaging story."

Just go see the movie I really don't come one metacritic to give reviews but I decided this movie should get more credit than it deserves it was really good and RIP to Glean Armstrong, I didn't know that he trusted these brave women of color to get him into space and land with their math calculations which helped in getting NASA into the next century. Please give this moive and Oscar and Golden Glob. It's a must see for everyone. I took notes during the movie. Also Ms. Johnson has a building named after her that's rare for a woman of color even her friends ran the IBM department and help develop the heat shield to protect the astronauts coming back from orbit.  10/10 for me"

      "text": "When you watch a movie based on true events that you watched when it was happening and know the ending it takes a good director, Theodore Melfi, good screenwriters, Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi, to get you caught up in the events being  shown on the screen and \"Hidden Figures\" is such a movie.There is also another part to the film that has a tag line \"the untold true story\" and that is a story most people, Black and White, don't know about. The film takes place in months leading up to John Glenn (played by Glen Powell) who figures importantly in this film aside from being an astronaut and racism is still ingrained in the American consciousness. The latter is shown in small and large ways, each effective, whether it is a woman having to run a half a mile to go to the 'colored women's bathroom\" even though she is capable and does help NASA solve many problems to get men in orbit around the world and get them back safely.Taraji P. Henson is real life Katherine Goble Johnson, a mathematical genius, who knows 'her place' and is insulted not only by words but by actions. She is only one woman of two in an office of a dozen men and she is Black having to put up with some indignities to do a job she loves, wants to keep, but when she reaches a point that she has had enough she is not afraid to open her mouth.The other woman in the office, the group's executive assistant played by Kimberly is not welcoming and the head engineer, played by Jim Parsons, first has no respect for Katherine and then disdain only to question the knowledge she gives that is more accurate than his. The only one who doesn't care about her sex or color but her much needed knowledge is her boss Al Harrison, played believably by Kevin Costner.There are other people in Katherine's life aside from her 3 children whose husband/father is dead, her mother and, about half way through, a very romantic army officer Mahershala Ali but two others, her best friends, also faces racism because of being Black, though very smart accomplished women. Dorothy Vaughan, played by a strong Octavia Spencer, is in charge of the West Computing Group, as they are referred to, made up of Black women which segregates them from the White women in the East Computing Group. She does the work and puts in the time that a supervisor does but she isn't given the title and certainly not the pay. She delivers a put down with a smile that hides her pain but tells the truth.The third woman is Mary Jackson, played by a saucy, smart Janelle Monae, who wants to be an engineer but, due to Virginia laws, is not allowed to attend the classes she needs to get the degree. (Ah Virginia, the State that is also the basis for the movie \"Loving\" and tells  another true story about that State's laws.) She has a husband, played by Aldis Hodge, who hesitates in backing her but has a Polish-Jewish refugee, played by Olek Krupa, from the concentration camps, who is all for her going for her dream.Based on the nonfiction book by Margot Lee Shetterly one doesn't know how much of the script by Schroeder and Melfi was \"Hollywoodized\" but a lot of it rings true and the production designs by Wynn Thomas and the costumes designed by Renee Ehrlich Kalfus certainly reflect the era.The acting by all is first rate but Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae give powerful performances showing how strong and accomplished Katherine, Dorothy and Mary were, the indignities they suffered and how just by being themselves they are role models for all of us.\"Hidden Figures\" has two story lines intertwined and as exciting as the race to the moon became the true story of what these three smart women had to go through because of their color was more interesting as the former was familiar to me while the latter was a learning experience about these women I knew nothing about and everyone should."
