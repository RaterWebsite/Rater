      "text": "Absolute national disgrace at how poorly reviewed and unpopular this film is, this film deserves to be widely regarded as a treasure of the English nation, it was THAT GOOD! It seems to just be Americans that hate this film and I think part of the reason why Americans hate this film is that Americans are jealous of the greatness of the British Empire and London in Victorian England when they watch this amazing film. Americans know that their hot ugly native American lands will never be as beautiful as Britain's when they see Britain's magic and beauty in this film, they know when they watch British geniuses that the USA will never get as big as the British Empire or as influential due to their governments relative stupidity and ultra Liberalism. I bet the Americans also didn't appreciate Victorian London and probably struggled to understand the British accents so that's also why this film's ratings are so unfairly low.So my message to the Americans is this, if you don't like it simply because you're jealous that you'll never be as good as your country's Father then you can stick to watching your crappy, mind dulling, simplistic American films instead and get even more stupid and simple as a result of watching your rubbish TV and films! If you DARE give such foul barbaric low ratings to films produced on your ancestors sexy island ever again, then I'll make sure Britain colonises the USA, grounds the USA for a month, forces the US to live with it's Dad again and force Americans to give 70% of their yearly wages to the British government in the form of taxes!This film was amazing, complex, thought provoking and above all British through and through. A truly amazing film, don't be turned off by Americans unappreciative **** and their retarded and pathetic jealousy of our amazing history lovely Brits. This movie is unsuitable for Americans but I recommend it to all Brits."

The graphics were incredible. I really liked the old English set. Daniel Radcliffe was great in the movie. I think he played the character really well. The storyline for the movie was interesting. Igor seemed to be torn between the woman he loved and the man who saved him from the circus. Great film."

I loved all the twisted science and art direction they used. The story and characters were interesting and made you excited to see what would happen next. I won't give any details but if you appreciate movies that make you delve a little deeper than what's on the surface, you'll like this movie too. It's not your ordinary mindless adventure."

      "text": "The difference in this reinterpretation is that it focuses on the relationship between crazed scientist Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy) and his hunchback Igor (Daniel Radcliffe), who has been reinvented as his brilliant prot\u00e9g\u00e9. The interesting twists to the traditional story begin with Igor's origin and continue thru the entire narrative. Most of them provided a fresh perspective, although McAvoy's ranting does get tedious (Radcliffe creates a sweet character). The cinematography, art direction and costumes beautifully capture the period. An absorbing, vigorous and interesting new version."

Further appeal of this picture comes from the strength in its solid storyline that kept us interested from start to finish. It was refreshing to see a quality Hollywood film that was not simply a special effects production. Well done. We would see it again. \ufeff"

      "text": "This really is an entertaining adaptation. But it lacks a lot of substance and somewhat lacks integrity. Acting was very enthusiastic but seemed like they were trying their hardest in a story which is so overused and has been done a million times that they needed something extra for imagination. There was just nothing particularly new or surprising. Plus, the very end scene really got me pissed off from the film's overall moral, it felt like a betrayal in honesty.  That said, I wasn't angry with this movie, nor was I bored for the most part. It was solidly entertaining and you'll have a good time at the cinema with this one."

      "text": "This is a handsome, but empty production.  Or, put another way, it is an imposing shell energized by the lightning of fine acting and craftsmanship, but adrift without a soul.  The idea is obvious:  create a spry, postmodern, and loose adaptation of the often-often-adapted Mary Shelley novel to attract the audience which drove Guy Ritchie's two enjoyable Sherlock Holmes films to around one billion worldwide.  But Shelley's gloomily Romantic story of science gone awry (and the prior cinematic versions which gave us malformed laboratory assistant Igor and \"IT'S ALIVE!\") proves an uncomfortable candidate for too-cool-for-school revisionism.  The result is a curious case of hyperactive lethargy in which no charming diversion\u2014not a wild-eyed camp performance by James McAvoy as the title character, not a love story for a straightened and beautified Igor (Daniel Radcliffe), not the extensive Victorian-era production design, not composer Craig Armstrong's thundering original score\u2014distracts from the fact next to nothing of consequence is transpiring, and there is a waning sense of anticlimax when the film finds its way around to the main creature-feature attraction just in time to end."

It\u2019s a very forgettable film, it doesn\u2019t really have much to offer, the actors are very decent but they are so bland in this film and it\u2019s a real shame that it\u2019s a blight on the careers of Director Paul McGuigan and Writer Mat Landis who are both very talented people, hopefully their next project together will be better.  There is very little praise to really give to the film, but at least it\u2019s a decently shot film and it never feels awful, it just feels boring and dull and you know that everyone involved can do better.  It\u2019s a mess pure and simple and it\u2019s probably down to studio interference and constant re-editing, which once again destroyed what was clearly a promising film, and it\u2019s a shame for James McAvoy and Daniel Ratcliffe who are actors that I really enjoy and have been given a film that is clearly not up to their talents.  I would skip this one altogether if I were you."

      "text": "An exciting reimagining of the classic horror story brought to life (pun intended) by the deliciously mad performances by Daniel Radcliffe and James McAvoy. Okay, so perhaps \"mad\" only applies to McAvoy. His eccentric performance as the bat-crap crazy Victor Frankenstein is outstanding. Radcliffe brings a more human and sweet side to the whole affair.\r We really shouldn't be surprised that these two knocked it out of the park. As far as their talent as actors goes, have they ever let us down? Here they seem to be having a lot of fun. Particularly McAvoy. To be honest it's the sense of fun that saves the film. The whole thing is as completely mad as it's title character. It's willingness to fully embrace it's craziness is what makes it so enjoyable.\r It's got it's awkward bits though. The moral dilemma is pretty solidly captured, but the interference to Frankenstein's plan brought on by the side characters falls a bit short. Mostly because those characters are so bland. The stars of the show here and definitely McAvoy and Radcliffe. Their characters are lovingly fleshed out with complexities and layers. Everyone else just kind of falls to the side. Not a huge issue, but a flaw nonetheless.\r Once you get past the awkward, slow motion ridden opening there is a dazzling movie to behold. One with  two fantastic lead characters played by equally fantastic actors. There's also a surprising heart to it all. This is essentially a tale of friendship. It's a crazy, exciting, and at times sweet ride. One that proves to be an exciting and likable horror-themed fantasy. Mostly due to how outstanding it's leads are.\r 8.2/10"

What follows for the best part of 2 hours is a 21st century treatment of this 19th century story, originally set in the late 18th century.\r To say that \u2018Victor Frankenstein\u2019 shares a lot with Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s recent Sherlock Holmes films would be an understatement, from setting a typically mostly central European late 18th century story in Victorian London, to the stylized dramatic action sequences and overall aesthetic, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking you\u2019re watching Guy Ritchie taking on Mary Shelley.\r James McAvoy stars in the titular role accompanied by Daniel Radcliffe through whose eyes the story is seen, both deliver adequate performances with McAvoy given the chance to flamboyantly overact to his heart\u2019s content, giving the film a graphic novel if not comic book sensibility. The production design is impressive as you might expect, with the dirty streets of Victorian London coming alive, as do the props and of course the creatures, literally.\r The film is billed as a re-imagining of the \u201cFrankenstein\u201d story which brings something new, that\u2019s certainly true in terms of veering away from the original novel, but in terms of the 80+ years of Hollywood treatment since, \u2018Victor Frankenstein\u2019 takes from virtually every version of this classic story making it disappointingly unimaginative for a \u201cre-imagining\u201d.\r Director Paul McGuigan\u2019s film does manage to shine a dim light on the original \u201cmad scientist\u2019s\u201d motivational inner demons and the dangers of scientific overreaching, but despite a good momentum and the entertainment value, ultimately \u2018Victor Frankenstein\u2019 is a fuel-injected version of a well-trodden theme.\r The Bottom Line\u2026\rSilly and fun, uninspired and forgettable, \u2018Victor Frankenstein\u2019 is an entertaining but unmemorable romp that offers little that\u2019s new to an established story, beyond its lavish interpretation."

This movie is intended to be reimagining of the classic tale but there is still not anything revolutionary going on. I enjoyed the first two acts of this film it may not have been the story that I was looking for but there was some fun to be had. In the third act though, everything falls apart in just a few scenes and it completely drags on and when the time comes you are not invested in the ending at all. James McAvoy was really the reason I watched this film in the first place and he is great here but there is some pretty obvious overacting in spots. Radcliffe is pretty solid as well as he often is."

      "text": "We are in the era where big companies retake old classics to adapt again and Twentieth Century Fox Film   did a decent job with respect to Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's Frankenstein. It is completely innocuous and unimportant to mention that Paul McGuigan makes the movie  aiming to do for \"Victor Frankenstein\" what Guy Ritchie did for \"Sherlock Holmes\", Victorian London but with a different theme:  \"Two men with the ability to generate life\".\r It is interesting to the reinvention of the classic focuses on Igor more than the same main character disappearing completely cliche that Victor is the center of attention, obviously, without downplay Victor in the movie.\r More than a story of monsters , religion and beliefs \"Victor Frankenstein\" is a story of true friendship that surpasses any buddy film.\r Landis'  script  addresses the issues of life and death in an impressive manner focusing not just on the name \" Frankenstein \" also in his friend \" Igor\" . This script takes the essentials of classical achieving a memorable tribute to the most fearsome monster of Hollywood. The script and the effects are a key part to connect the film with the audience but clearly are the actors who work for the reborn:  Radcliffe took the right tone to become the shadow of  'Victor' ( perhaps for his dream of  medicine expert or in gratitude for his flamboyant remove hump) although at times McAvoy stole the limelight to 'Igor'. The performances of these two ambitious men are truly spectacular, them feelings and differences make the trip that much more fun and entertaining , these two guys deserve a ton of applause.\r The break point of the movie are ten long minutes, where they are presented many villains, and often the case the bromance ((Jessica Brown Findlay\u2019s trapeze artist, Lorelei) appears to exist largely to deflect suspicions that Victor and Igor only have eyes for each other (not counting the eyes in formaldehyde, of course).\r \"Gordon\" and \"Prometheus\" (the first experiments of them ) are shown in a majestic manner , with a dark touch but with a careful hand of details that make each look truly amazing .\r However , the end is not the best, but leaves the door open for a possible franchise, that according to public reaction (Box Office) and apparently , it is very unlikely to see a sequel due to the few gains so far over budget.\r \"Victor Frankenstein\", really surprised , managing to show a new face of classic , fresh it , and exceeding what we had in mind.\r Innovative, refreshing , exciting and totally unbelievable becomes the new invention of  \"Victor and Igor\"."

      "text": "Victor Frankenstein is not without its flaws, but on the whole, it's an interesting, visually striking and thoroughly well-acted take on a classic tale. Daniel Radcliffe gives an impressive performance as Igor, James McAvoy does a good job as the title character and Andrew Scott makes for a good antagonist. As I mentioned, I did have a few gripes- not all of the plot elements were entirely plausible and the only major female character in the movie does pretty much nothing for the plot. That said, there is still plenty to enjoy in the movie- McAvoy and Radcliffe had great chemistry and the production design was amazing. Overall, Victor Frankenstein may anger purists, but it's a fun movie that gives an iconic tale an intruiging twist. 7/10."
