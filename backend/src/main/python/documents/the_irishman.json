He provides a subtle but important frame to the film - nice uroboros. Joe Pesci is just phenomenal - I truly hope he picks up at least a supporting actor nom for his performance, if not a win. The dialogue is pitch-perfect.  Just an amazing job by Scorsese."

      "text": "A huge (and lengthy) swing and a miss from Scorsese, De Niro, and Netflix. The plot was meandering and directionless, the writing stale and regurgitated. There were several scenes involving dialogue between two characters in which they argued about minor inconsequential details, repeating those details back to one another through numerous camera changes, and the viewer is left wondering, \"Did I just sit through 30 seconds of another meaningless conversation about whether the mob \u2018really means it this time'\"? I would need to watch those scenes again to be sure (I won't) but it didn't seem like those scenes had any higher purpose other than showcasing the editor's boredom with the subject matter (or maybe Netflix's budgetary desire to limit the best directors and actors of our generation to one take).Aside from complaints about De Niro's believability as Irish, his acting was wooden. Pacino occasionally shone as Jimmy Hoffa despite some difficult dialogue, Joe Pesci was solid in an understated performance, and Stephen Graham turned in a typically excellent, nuanced portrayal of simmering anger beneath an outwardly gregarious exterior. There are a couple superior moments, one involving a vodka-spiked watermelon, and another with some great dialogue between Louis Cancelmi and the perpetually confused Jesse Plemons regarding the provenance of a nonexistent fish. Ray Romano was largely forgettable\u2014although that may have been the point\u2014but appearances by Anna Paquin, Harvey Keitel, and Bobby Canivale were entirely wasted. At three hours and thirty minutes long, I kept hoping there was enough time for a clear throughline to emerge, but as the movie shifted in the last half hour to bludgeoning the viewer over the head with scenes of a man contemplating his death and haggling over caskets, I realized that like De Niro's Irishman, there would be no redemption for this movie. Instead, it is simply Scorsese's meandering, aimless final run with some of his mobster-portraying pals.Unfortunately The Irishman is not even close to being in the same league as his other work. If you'll excuse me, I need to go watch Goodfellas, Gangs of New York, and The Departed on repeat for the next several days to erase the memory of this dud. It'll be a much better use of my (and anyone else's) time."

If this was just a gangster flick, it would not be a great one, but it is memorable because it is more than that.  This is a tale about morality and loyalty.  It presents the life story of a decent, loyal guy, a devoted family man and trustworthy buddy - who is also a crook and a cold-blooded killer, a Mafia operative and hit man, a guy who would shoot a friend in the face or the back if it was called for.  The long ending and slow start recall the films of an earlier era, as does the prolonged presentation of the Jimmy Hoffa story."

From the top class performances, the ace cinematography, the excellent music and, most importantly, the captivating plot. I enjoyed this more than (the great) 'Goodfellas', which is my only previous experience of a Martin Scorsese film.Robert De Niro is always a fantastic watch and here he is no different, I absolutely loved every scene of him as Frank. Al Pacino (Jimmy) and Joe Pesci (Russell) are also superb, Pacino particularly. Away from those three, you also have Ray Romano, Bobby Cannavale, Stephen Graham and Harvey Keitel involved. Awesome cast.No idea how true to life it is, all I care is if it delivers a fantastic film - and it undoubtedly does. I felt entertained for every second. The de-aging effects are cool to see, also.

It\u2019s seamless. Each scene flows, for the most part, and sure some of it drags, but it all leads up to one hell of an ending.

It shines through in some aspects due to it's strong cast and interesting story...but for me, the duration and the quantity of stories happening at the same time, while we go back and forth in the timeline, made me get a little lost and misunderstand some points in the narrative. Talking about the timeline, another downside is that the story is too flat, meaning that, in the duration of the movie, all the stories told are very simmilar with no action or drama to make them outstand.In summary, even though, in the beggining the plot called my attention (so did the cast), the movie is not a big deal, but if you are free for a couple of hours, it can - maybe - distract you."

I enjoyed the last hour or so, but the first hour in particular was a real slog to get through and I actually watched the film in 3 sittings, not due to time restraints, purely as I became too bored to continue twice. The casting of Combo from This Is England (I forget his name, some scouser) was dreadful, his attempt at the accent - I think it was New Jersey or similar, is absolutely dreadful and really stands out, easily the worst part of the film for me and he ruined every scene he was in. The real travesty in the film was the anti-aging used, it simply doesn't work. It's OK making De Niro look 50 again, but when he moves like an old man it's unintentionally hilarious, a scene where he beats someone up had me in stitches, you could blatantly tell it was an old man doing it, with some silly Toy Story style cgi making his face look younger. Of course you get the standard Rolling Stones song thrown in as per usual as well, I'm not sure if the director is unaware it's a parody now how he crowbars the same damn tune into every film he makes or he's in on the joke. I've given it a 6/10 as like I said, I enjoyed the last hour, and Joe Pesci is fantastic in it, it's really a shame he doesn't act anymore and I've really missed him the past two decades. Pacino however, well he's the same old hammy, shouty, over-acting self and it's clear why Scorsese hadn't worked with him previously - the guy can't act, and De Niro is De Niro, the man has one style no matter what role he's taking and his constant sniffing and breathing in only gets worse now he's ancient. All in all though, it's clearly a vanity project by Scorsese, and a last chance for him to get all his doddery old fart friends together before they all start dying. I'm baffled how this film is being lauded so highly, it's very mundane and in parts will make you almost fall asleep, De Niros performance is phoned in, Pacino is as awful as ever, the CGI is immersion breaking, when Gimme Shelter comes on AGAIN in a MS film you'll either laugh or roll your eyes, the Scouser playing an American stands out like a sore thumb and it's at least an hour too long. The only redeeming feature is the excellent Joe Pesci. If not for him appearing, and a decent last hour then I don't think I'd rate it any higher than a 4. It's clear to see why this ended up on Netflix, it's simply not good enough for a theatre release and people would have either walked out through sheer boredom, or fallen asleep. It'll be a real shame if this ends up being the last Scorsese film, or the last time you see Pesci and De Niro together as quite frankly, the film is dogsh**."

The story is a sprawling gangster epic that truly leaves no stone un-turned. The brilliance of the story is that it does not romanticize the gangster lifestyle, but truly shows the curse of a man punished with longevity for his actions.The acting is incredible all across the board. Robert De Niro gives a virtuoso performance. Al Pacino chews the scenery in a way that is both magnificent and desperately heartbreaking. Joe Pesci makes a triumphant return to the big screen, and he is arguably the best part of the film. The ensemble supporting cast of mobsters and political figures are all so charming and serve to fill up this world to its brim.The de-aging technology used on De Niro, Pesci, and Pacino was expertly implemented. I actually didn't mind it at all, and it was used in such a way so that it actually served the story rather than distract from it. It's absolutely remarkable to see.The movie is not perfect, however. It is 3 and a half hours long, and I felt every minute of that run time. I actually started to get anxious over sitting in one place for so long. Also, I felt that the way the story was told, through the characters playing telephone, got very repetitive and it sometimes sucked the life out of the movie.

There were a lot of scenes that were just boring because of the uninteresting situation, but those scenes were saved by wonderful performances. That is a point I will not deny: The performances are just fantastic. Probably one of the best acted films I've seen all year. This is a movie in which I don't know how to feel, because, like I said, at points it lost my interest, but at other points I thought it was the best film of the year. Its good moments are fantastic and to me, the ending saves the movie completely.Besides the overly long runtime, I noticed some editing and sound issues. I don't know but at points I noticed that the ADR was poorly edited. At some points I saw a character move his lips and there was no audio or it was delayed. There was one point in the movie where there was an editing mistake that felt so amateur: There was a shot and then abruptly cut to another shot, like if the editor messed up. Also there is a scene where the characters are at like a party and, while it's not a crowded and loud place, the scene sounded as if the characters were in a quiet room with a radio playing music in the background, so distracting.Other than that, I feel like this movie was great. I know this might not be a movie for everyone. It has tons of complicated dialogue and the movie relies heavily in dialogue and narration. There's little to no visual storytelling or music (specifically, original score). This movie is tedious but I don't think it's bad or boring."
