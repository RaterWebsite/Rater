Starring Antonio Banderas plays a new version of El Marachi i have to say he is pretty good at  also working with Salma Hayek. Rodriguez's films are over ratted but there one hell or a ride , his films have impressed me and he is the king of adventure  , comedy , violence ( i wonder if he made GTA ?) ....... nah. all of this explosions in film with the guitar cases with the stunts its pretty epic. Its one Director Robert Rodriguez's best. Grade A+"

      "text": "Typical cliche revenge flick, the film has its good moments but the whole film just falls flat at the end, the climax is just stupid, El mariachi simply pulls out his sleeve guns and kills the main bad guy after they have a conversation and then it just ends and he is with his girlfriend heading off somewhere into the sunset not revealing what happened in the rest of the gunfight where at least 10 bad guys are pointing a gun at him. What i enjoyed most were the scenes with Tarantino and steve buscemi who are the best actors in the film by far and there scenes were memorable and funny but they get very little screen time which is a shame. The story is weak very weak and the main character is uninteresting, the gunfight scenes are not that creative. The film goes completely insane at the end when one has a rocket launcher guitar case which is just stupid, i know im suppose to laugh at that but i just dident. The film is just not enjoyable to watch and gets a bit repetitive and boring. It starts well the first 30 minutes are pretty good but the rest is just a mess. If you like westerns and action then give it a watch its not all bad. This film just about avoids negative on the fact it has some good scenes and some good actors are in it, also i like the soundtrack but all the songs sound the same."

Though I love his work on the Sin City films, particularly the first, his incredible earlier trilogy will always hold a special place in my cinephilic heart.\r My recent project of coming to terms with classic Westerns has only further helped me enjoy these more recent contemporary releases."

The performances are more professional, the dialogue is more memorable, the action is unforgettable, and even the campiness is played up to a much more successful degree. And things haven't exactly been ramped up in terms of budget this time around either, still proving that you can make a worthwhile action film without breaking the bank."

If you don't, well, then it's not.Desperado is a good bad movie. Would recommend for a comedy night, but for being the purpose it is, it's bad."

      "text": "Antonio Banderas stars in this 1995 action film that came out the same year as Assassins which also starred Banderas alongside Sylvester Stallone and Julianne Moore.... Made in 1995 by director, Robert Rodriguez you could say DESPERADO is violent, infact too violent but that's not the problem with this film. It has so many stupid parts like Danny Trejo's character throwing knives at people without any real explanation and he's a crap shot at it too which is embarrassing... The main villain named Bucho is camp as they come and it's all very stupid. The only decent people in the whole movie are Antonio Banderas and the sexy Salma Hayek and some of the acting is overacted or we get stupid characters and Quentin Tarantino's short role in Desperado was awful so he should stick to directing because he sure can't act... Desperado contains violence, bad language, nudity and sex but the sex is probably the only reason to watch it.. Too violent and silly.. Assassins made the same year as Desperado by Richard Donner was a much better film."

The entire filmography of his tickles my brain. What? Why? And how? First of all, his commercialized version of a film is pretty close to the art form he wishes to speak. Now, this is my window in. I love these aspects of his films. The Tarantino alike- it is not a surprise since they have collaborated with each other plenty of time over the years- stories or call it a monologue that these guys share is the way to hook you in. So why not go through it. Now take Tarantino's films for instance. These stories, fables, tid bits is what we call the crisp, the entertainment part of the film.Just as the violence, the action in the film is. What then Tarantino does with the rest of the time, is ground these parties, the enjoyment, the weekend of the film with is proper heavy and profound themes with a new take and perspective. Now, this is where Robert falls short. His film, if not rummaging around the jokes and the action, will simply color the film and the characters with incredibly filmy or more expressively lofty substances.Not even substances but scenarios. These scenes that he wishes to project doesn't only feel forced but also questionable. The choices that these stereotypical one dimensional characters make, is something wrongly unfathomable. And to add more trouble Robert too isn't balancing the laws that he establishes. Take the last act of Desperado. One where our protagonist after a battle that he fought with a half-grin plastered across his face, now is told to draw out empathy as a character that he is emotionally connected is hospitalized. I still don't understand the existence of that last piece and certainly not the way it is projected."

I quite liked the slower scenes with the main character, the Mariachi, talking to and helping the young Mexican boy with his guitar playing. If you like action thrillers, then this is certainly worth a watch, although it is quite bloody, so it won't suit all."
