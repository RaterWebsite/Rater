      "text": "This CGI movie from Dreamworks Animation tells the story about Oscar, a fish who is tired of being called a \"nobody\", dreams of something big. One day, when he gets chased by a shark, an anchor kills it and Oscar tells a white lie in which it makes him a famous killer known as the \"sharkslayer. He meets Lenny, a shark who turns out to be a vegetarian and ran away from his father Don Lino and realizes that his false claim has serious consequences as he tries to sort out the whole problem by telling the truth.\r I caught a screening of this in theaters the same year it came out and I really enjoyed it, but a few years later, I've finally realized that this movie didn't turn out quite well.\r The first problem I had with this movie was the moral lesson. In the ending scene where Oscar finally admits that he lied, he gets the money he had transferred to the Whale Wash where he now works as a manager. Is that what you want to teach your kids? That if you tell the truth, you will get what you want? I'm sorry, but that was very inexcusable.\r Another problem that I had with this movie was the characters. They weren't even developed and were not that likable. At most of the scenes, they were very annoying and their personalities were too predictable.\r I will give Dreamworks Animation credit for the CGI animation and art design plus the voice acting and music score included, but most of the time they were overshadowed by a poorly written storyline, bad jokes and puns, overused clich\u00c3\u00a9s from other CGI movies, and the villain voiced by Robert De Niro wasn't even threatening or diabolical.\r Dreamworks, I love you, but if everyone has to pick at least one CGI movie that was bad, then frankly, this was it. Even though I loved it as a child, I seemed to hate it. It's watchable for the kids, but for the adults, however, it's not even entertaining.\r I also really hated the fact that this clich\u00c3\u00a9d, unfunny CGI movie made so much money and became the highest grossing animated movies of 2004 (which Shrek 2 and The Incredibles held their own ranks.) because there was no way any bad CGI movie like this could make that amount of cash.\r Overall, it isn't the worst CGI movie yet, but I think I've seen the worst parts in this movie and I've seen better Dreamworks animation movies than this. Sorry, Dreamworks, but this one deserves a good punch in the face.\r 3/10"

The movie uses adult humor to appeal to parents and teenagers with little regard to its main demographic: children, and ultimately the jokes are unfunny and tasteless. And in the end, the main character learns NOTHING. He lies, he cheats, he takes advantage of his friends, and he steps on everyone else's heads in order to make his way to the top, and yet his friends still come to his aid. And does he properly apologize for treating everyone he knows like a bunch of chum buckets, or does he at least thank his friends for standing by him even though he was a total jerk? Nope. In the end, the moral of the story is: It's okay to step on heads and lie and cheat your way to the top, as long as you get away with it. That's a great message, no? No! The best thing about this movie is its voice acting, which is pretty easy on the ears but is only decent at best. This movie gets a 3/10 from me. If you want to see a good animated movie that takes place under the sea, don't waste your time with Shark Tale... go find Nemo."

      "text": "Not that I am biased to anything Pixar makes (90% of the time, they are masterpieces), but DreamWorks' 'Shark Tale' is in no way as endearing or fun as 'Finding Nemo' (2003), my all time favorite Pixar film.\r Will Smith voices our main hero as he seems to be a nobody at first, but soon gains recognition after many see him as a \"Shark slayer\" when he is shown taking down a shark voiced by Jack Black. Black's character seems depressed when his father, voiced by Robert De Niro who seems to be doing an impression of Marlon Brando in 'The Godfather' (1972) wants him to basically be tough and basically be like the mafia. Because your kids will understand all of this.\r Other voicing talents include Renee Zelwegger whose character is fascinated by Smith's, but he is distracted by Angelina Jolie's character, and we even have legendary director Martin Scorsese voicing a blowfish named Sykes. Clearly the casting of Scorsese and Robert De Niro was intentional as this movie is nothing but trying to pay homage to 'The Godfather' (1972) and 'Goodfellas' (1990), which obviously EVERY child has watched and loved. (By the way, that was sarcasm...)\r 'Finding Nemo' (2003) was a simple story about a concerned father who wants to look for his missing son, every adult and child watching that will understand, and it could bring them closer together. This film relies heavily on mafia/mob movie references that children may not understand. It's too dependent on pop-culture to keep the jokes going. I know 'Aladdin' (1992) is a movie that also relies on pop-culture, but that movie also had songs, and only some likable characters...I'll put it out there, 'Aladdin' (1992) is a movie I liked, but didn't love...'Beauty and the Beast' (1991) is the one that's perfect in my opinion.\r But enough about the 90s Disney films, what I am trying to say is, these \"kid's films\" don't need constant pop-culture references to keep them entertaining, the colorful animation alone will distract the kids, and maybe the slapstick humor, but this is DreamWorks' attempt to try and create something like 'Finding Nemo' (2003), and instead settled for a watered down (pun intended) sequel to 'The Godfather' films."

      "text": "Like any studio-financed, machine-pressed animation production, Shark Tale\u2014Dreamworks' feeble response to Pixar's superior Finding Nemo\u2014has several credited directors and writers. But the real, uncredited architects are a bunch of kids in the mall: Every single joke, character detail, music montage, and pop-culture reference looks extensively market-tested, whether via screenings, focus groups, or other box-office successes. With dollar signs in its eyes and nothing in its heart, Shark Tale calculates each moment for the broadest appeal, but its impact couldn't be more impersonal. The filmmakers are convinced people will like it because the spreadsheets and pie charts tell them so, not because they've invested it with originality or passion.\r Round 2 in the war of attrition between Dreamworks and Pixar (the latter also handily won in the first round, which pitted A Bug's Life against Dreamworks' Antz), Shark Tale steals shamelessly from Finding Nemo, but actually has a good idea at its core. Under the sea, sharks are no doubt near the top of the food chain, so it makes sense to cast them as high-living gangsters, muscling the weaker fish around the reef and turning the ocean into a vast seafood buffet. But the movie really belongs to Will Smith, in full Fresh Prince mode (hip-hop for the whole family!) as a fast-talking, blinged-out little gill-flapper with dreams of upward mobility. In a reef designed to look like Times Square, complete with irritating fake/real product logos for Coral-Cola and the Gup, Smith mops sludge at a Whale Wash while eyeing the penthouse. When a dropped anchor pummels a vicious shark henchman, Smith earns instant money and fame for taking credit for the kill, but mob boss Robert De Niro wants his revenge.\r The vocal talents in Shark Tale run deep: A mush-mouthed Jack Black, sounding like an effeminate Arnold Horshack, plays a swishy vegetarian shark; Ren\u00e9e Zellweger plays a doe-eyed Jane who secretly loves Smith; Angelina Jolie plays a fish fatale; and Martin Scorsese plays a double-dealing puffer fish. (Scorsese fanatics who would rather not hear the great director exclaim \"Yo! Yo! Yo!\" or \"Raise the reef!\" should stay home.) A few lively early scenes in gangland, particularly the inside jabs between De Niro and Scorsese, suggest that The Godfather could work underwater, though it's a sign of the film's obviousness that the mobsters convene in the Titanic wreckage. Soon enough, Shark Tale gives itself over to Smith, who riffs up his usual storm of non-threatening street language and braggadocio, all while playing a character with an antiheroic desire for banal human crap. Smith feels right at home in an urban seascape cluttered with high-rises, billboards, taxis, and elevators, but the film's aquatic corollary to the real world barely counts as escapism."
