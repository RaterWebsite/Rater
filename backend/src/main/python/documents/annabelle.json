It's like Paranormal activity, Rosemary's Baby and Chucky had a threesome and their love child was \"ANNABELLE\"\r So, 3 things that could have made the movie better. 1) NEVER SHOW THE DEMON. I thought that was a given, but apparently I was wrong. 2) PICK A REAL GROUP. Disciples of the Ram? They just wanted to use the Baphomet picture. 3) DON'T MAKE A FAKE CULT SYMBOL THAT LOOKS LIKE A CURSIVE A. When it first showed up, I was all excited, thinking \"Oh. That's cool. The demon Zorro-ed an A in her arm, like Annabelle. Creepy.\" But then it turned out it was some half-assed sigil that was something about soul transfer.\r So that's it. It blows."

Is there hope for the American horror-movie-going audience? Annabelle is a solid film with a plot, characters, and good acting. Yes, it is derivative, but it also creates a consistent mood and atmosphere and conjures up some real emotion at the end. No, it is not original, but it is also not a stupid and empty slasher fest, full of blood and gore where the director just goes \u201cboo!\u201d at you every few minutes. This kind of film is actually mocked during the features before this film by picturing teenagers doing such stupid things that the monster even looks exasperated. So bravo for a solid (if not great) horror film whose success will hopefully encourage more films in the tradition of \u201creal\u201d and more genuinely frightening films like Psycho, Rosemary\u2019s Baby, and The Haunting of Hill House."

You should turn in your critic card - yesterday.  This is a horrible movie that commits the cardinal sin of horror movies - it bores the hell out of you.  Nothing happens in this film.  It's as if the movie's been sitting on the shelf for about 15 years, and the writers/director haven't seen anything that's come out in the horror genre since then.  Really embarrassing for Warner Bros.  Godawful crap.  Please, do yourself a favor, horror fans, and go see The Guest, Honeymoon, or any number of really good horror movies released this year.  Better yet, go check out You're Next or A Horrible Way to Die from Adam Wingard - one director who is doing horror right these days.  One more note on Annabelle - it seems that any form of entertainment that employs Alfre Woodward these days - be it Copper, Last Ship, True Blood etc. - officially jumps the shark when she appears.  I loved her in her early career, but she spells doom for whatever she's in lately."

While the visual style and poor acting are from that era, the scares are not. It is very much a modern feeling horror movie, and a boring one at that. No more boring than your average non-scary horror movie, but boring nonetheless.\r If anything it might actually help you appreciate the attempts at tension building the average horror duds have, as this movie has none. The slow moments aren't there to build up scares. They're just there and only serve to bore.\r The attempts as frights are served up in the ever predictable form of jump scares. While these types of things do manage to scare some people, as evident by the fact that directors keep using them and making small fortunes at the box office, the more seasoned horror movie veteran is going to be left completely unshaken. This horror fanatic was just left yawning.\r While I appreciate the attention to detail that was used to bring the era back to life I wish more was done to tap some of the influence of the horror movies of that time. That way even if it wasn't scary it would have at least been a decent throwback. As it stands it lacks atmosphere and the ability to instill fear. When you consider that this is a spin-off of \"The Conjuring\" and has ties to a true story it's even more disappointing.\r I give the movie a 4.3/10."

With paranormal activity esque camera work (which is the best part of the whole film) and a doll which is genuinely creepy, the first half does contain suspense and maybe a scare and a third. However after maybe 40 odd minutes, the film devolves into something more like scary movie or drag me to hell. All suspense is lost as we see the beastie who is behind everything (a dude with a goat's head) and we hear about the back story of the doll, which is nonsense. Overall this film was dissapointing, as the doll was one of the two scary parts of the conjuring, but this film is not scary, it's just kind of silly and dull."

Before all of the reviews hit, I wanted to see it, because I really, really liked \"The Conjuring\", and after - just for the lulz, as the internets say. So I did. And it's not that bad.\rDirected by John R. Leonetti, who confuses me a lot, this movie surprised me. It's shot in a very weird way, with a lot of awkward zooming and noobish positioning, however one particular thing caught my attention. I've seen it in other movies too, and I enjoy when it's integrated so well. \"Annabelle\" is a perfect example of this style of horror capture, where the camera is always, as if, focused on an object or part of the scenery, which makes the uneasy feeling rise; as if something is ready to creep out of there. It's quite effective. Other than that, this movie has a competent feel, but fails when it comes to originality in any form.\rThe script is particularly weak; it feels as if it has been written up for a few days with no extra though being put into it. The overall plot is also confusing - the movie doesn't really know what it is about. New and new threads of story are introduced, but none of them seem to go anywhere. The whole purpose of everything seems simply to \"be\". It's like a ball of yarn that comes apart - you expect there to be something at the core, but there is nothing. It simply ends.\rThe actors are pretty bland as well. They've managed to create and act-out the most generic couple ever; also, the whole sense of the era of this movie (which was very well recreated in \"The Conjuring\") is lost between a few minor implications.\rHowever, even after all of these negatives, I had fun with \"Annabelle\". It was a very simple movie that managed to never get boring. The techniques it used were old as time, and have been implied much better in other movies, however there is a certain charm about the movie that kept me interested up until the end.\rThis movie is not for everyone. But some people might enjoy it, if they'd like to see it. The movie is partially haunting, it has a few really awesome scenes, and even when it is absolutely horrible - it's pretty funny. Overall - I don't think you can have a bad time with this movie. It's certainly a good option to have in this season. It's not \"The Conjuring\", it's much more simple in a bad way, but in that simplicity, pure joy of empty viewership can be achieved if one wishes to do so."

That remaining 22 minutes includes credits!!\" How they managed to do it was due to an EXTREMELY sloppy edit in which the main  characters were confusingly  all of a sudden at  totally different places and with totally different characters then had been implied would occur a mere 5 seconds previously.

The attractive leads are also better than the usual cyphers placed in these types of films and the story is generally quite logically played out. References to Polanski's 'Rosemary's Baby' abound and there are definitely shocks to be had along the way. One sequence involving a sewing machine, a hob and some popcorn is cut to elicit maximum tension. Two supporting players are effectively presented with menacing undertones, but the movie's biggest mystery remains why anyone would want to own such a sinister looking doll in the first place. The final scenes become somewhat predictable, but I must say that it sets up the scenario for last year's' The Conjuring' very nicely, and is actually preferable."
