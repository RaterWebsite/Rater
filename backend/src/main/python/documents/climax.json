I was set for a really amazing dance film.Forty minutes later, for the second or third time, I told Allen I was ready to leave whenever he wanted. but he wanted to stay to see where it went.

S\u00ed, yo s\u00e9 que es una oraci\u00f3n que no se debe de usar de cualquier manera y que su valor es tan poderoso como para que solo los dioses se la merezcan, pero si Aglaya me diera la oportunidad de conquistarla le invitar\u00eda una crepa dulce y la llevar\u00eda al cine a ver \u00e9sta muestra de creatividad, ingenio y humanidad pura.El Jazz es un g\u00e9nero meramente musical que se identifica por su veracidad y capacidad de generar estructuras de dialogo instrumental a trav\u00e9s de la improvisaci\u00f3n. Pero hoy me atrevo a estipular al Jazz como un g\u00e9nero visual y cinem\u00e1tico tambi\u00e9n. \u00c9ste es el primer acercamiento que tengo al cine de Gaspar No\u00e9 y ya con la obligaci\u00f3n de estudiarlo en su totalidad declaro que \u00e9l y su propuesta visual es totalmente Jazzista. Como si la construcci\u00f3n y posterior descomposici\u00f3n de la imagen fuera el tema principal en Climax, No\u00e9 entra al estudio con un gui\u00f3n de 5 p\u00e1ginas y la presurosa intenci\u00f3n de grabar en solo 2 semanas para mostrarnos una puesta en escena construida en su 80% con improvisaciones. Los di\u00e1logos, los bailes y la expresiones del elenco se van adaptando a las situaciones que se han establecido para que, a trav\u00e9s de largos y grandiosos planos secuencias, la brocha de la c\u00e1mara pinte con los actores toda la cinematograf\u00eda.La actuaci\u00f3n, por lo tanto, es una muestra de drama carnal interpretado por cuerpos y almas apasionados por la misma improvisaci\u00f3n. Con la intenci\u00f3n de querer mencionar a los 24 respetables y excelsos miembros del Cast, solo remarcar\u00e9 a la merecedora de un Academy Award por su actuaci\u00f3n en Climax, Sofia Boutella, quien es, literalmente, la \u00fanica en el cast que tiene una carrera cinematogr\u00e1fica. Aparte de ella, repito, todos merecen al menos una nominaci\u00f3n en los festivales m\u00e1s refinados como mejor elenco o mejor actuaci\u00f3n de soporte. El merito est\u00e1 en la capacidad de todos de encarnar una propia versi\u00f3n de una situaci\u00f3n que construye personas conscientes y las resume en \u00fanicamente impulsos y reacciones epil\u00e9pticas. El dinamismo emocional que la historia le exige a sus talentos y la creatividad de razonamiento que ellos mismos se crean para generar el arco narrativo, le da ganas al p\u00fablico de aplaudir el nivel de resoluci\u00f3n psico-motriz que los actores tienen.En la cuesti\u00f3n visual, existe una po\u00e9tica magistral tanto en la forma t\u00e9cnica de crear la visi\u00f3n como en el contenido de la imagen, pues el uso de la colorimetr\u00eda apoya la semi\u00f3tica de la narrativa. \u00c9sta semiotica no es estricta, lo cual hace de toda la pel\u00edcula una gran oportunidad para que el p\u00fablico cree una interpretaci\u00f3n propia y personal del viaje narrativo. Independientemente de la interpretaci\u00f3n que le demos, la c\u00e1mara y la fotograf\u00eda, soportadas por el mismo Gaspar No\u00e9, funcionan como las v\u00edas de una monta\u00f1a rusa que jugar\u00e1 con nuestras emociones de la forma m\u00e1s espontanea y brusca posible, dej\u00e1ndonos sorprendidos por la intrusi\u00f3n \u00edntima que logra con su sola estructura dram\u00e1tica visual. Sin darnos tiempo de indignarnos por esa intrusi\u00f3n, simplemente nos queda reflexionar y lentamente regresar a una vida real cuyo sabor no es tan dulce y tampoco tan amargo como lo que se acaba de ver. Ese es el \u00e9xito principal de Climax, pues nos levanta del suelo y nos sacude con tanto fervor que una vez terminada la experiencia, la vida real se siente tan diferente y sin la misma chispa de energ\u00eda que las ganas de volver a sentir ese golpe de adrenalina no faltar\u00e1n.Hay una gran cantidad de elementos que fluyen y sorprenden al p\u00fablico de diferentes maneras. El ingenio, la innovaci\u00f3n y la creatividad que surge en la sala de edici\u00f3n de No\u00e9 se siente muy viva a trav\u00e9s de la m\u00fasica que usa durante toda la narrativa y los diferentes cortes y elementos gr\u00e1ficos que aglomera en una fiesta de destellos visuales. Las letras, los mensajes, los negros, los blancos, los \u00e1ngulos, les letreros, etc, todo se intercala para consolar a los ojos y almas de los que deseamos del cine una experiencia intima y espectacular. Tan cerca de ser un desastre que anonada con su osad\u00eda.Climax, sin querer hacer el cuento a\u00fan m\u00e1s bello, es simplemente una sorpresa, una intrusi\u00f3n, una liberaci\u00f3n y una experiencia \u00fanica en el cine que te puede hacer llorar, vomitar y sonre\u00edr."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This movie is pretty fantastic.

However, once the LSD trip really starts kicking in in the second half, it really got a lot more random and aimless, not to say that this is a bad thing, as it fit well with the ensuing chaos. The camera even began filming upside down for much of the second half, which was obviously very disorienting but also kinda cool. Overall, it's definitely full of shocking and grotesque moments.

I got my money back."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "A disgusting, morally reprehensible piece of insane geniusClimax, the latest film from Argentinian-French provocateur Gaspar No\u00e9, is a disturbing, depraved, disgusting, and debauched piece of absolute insane genius that I thoroughly adored from beginning to end, and which I never, ever, want to see again. Set in the winter of 1996, and allegedly based on a real incident in France that year, the film focuses on a dance troupe putting the finishing touches to a performance before embarking on a national tour. Upon finishing rehearsals, the troupe starts to party. As the night wears on, it becomes apparent that one of their number has spiked the sangria with powerful LSD, with each member descending into their own personal Hades of paranoia, violence, and/or wild sexuality.In lieu of any kind of title card or opening credits, Climax begins with an abstract and non-descript shot of pure white. It is only as a girl staggers into shot from the top of the frame that it becomes apparent we are looking directly downwards onto a snowfield. After a moment, the girl collapses, and the camera revolves upwards along the vertical-axis through 360 degrees. Revealing the bare branches of a few nearby threadbare trees, the shot immediately establishes that we are in an isolated location in the dead of winter. Theoretically, this could be the clich\u00e9d opening scene to any generic slasher movie. However, the economy with which the shot conveys so much information serves to betray the fact that this is the meticulously composed opening salvo of an auteur who knows precisely what he's doing.A moment later, the entire closing credits roll (upwards, obviously), right to the copyright information, and because there are no closing credits at the end of the film, the audience is allowed no transition back to reality. As the film ended, the lights immediately popped on, with no music to play us out, no darkened theatre to recompose ourselves. Indeed, to enhance the sense of discombobulation for which No\u00e9 is obviously striving, the last 15 minutes or so of the film are literally upside-down, with the absence of closing credits and the inverted image creating a sense of confusion and discomfort, just as the film is depicting the surviving dancers coming out of their drug-induced mania and back to the real world.After the opening scene, the film shows the dancers' audition interviews, followed by the dance number. The second section is the dancers engaged in conversation with one another after rehearsals. The third section sees them realise the sangria is spiked, attempt to find out who did it, and the chaos that ensues when the drugs take hold. These three sections (dance, conversations, and drugs) roughly correspond to the three books of the Divina Commedia - Paradiso, Purgatorio, and Inferno. However, in the poem, the order is Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso. The film moves in the opposite direction, as the Paradiso of the dance sequence gives way to the calm Purgatorio, before the descent into the Inferno.We then witness a girl's head being set on fire, a pregnant girl being kicked repeatedly in the stomach, a girl slashing her own arm and face, a contortionist contorting to the point where he literally splinters his own bones, a child locked in a room full of cockroaches, a man scratching his chest to the point that it starts bleeding, public urination, lesbian rape, incest, and suicide. It's all very Disney!But is there any kind of theme underpinning the whole thing, or is it shocking for the sake of being shocking? It would certainly be easy to dismiss Climax as thematically empty, but there is a political point buried beneath the carnage; the dance sequence takes place in front of a massive French flag, whilst the credits declare, \"A French Film. And proud of it.\" Perhaps related to this, the troupe is made up of a cross-section of Europeans, and in the explosion of excess hedonism and hysterical mayhem, does this cross-section of ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations come to represent European multiculturalism tearing itself apart? In relation to this, Omar (Adrien Sissoko), the person who is initially blamed for spiking the sangria, is Muslim. Is No\u00e9 saying that in such a multicultural milieu, it's very easy to blame everything on the Islamic \"Other\"?The fact is, I don't have a clue what Climax is about. Nor do I care. I take it for what it appears on the surface; an incredibly technically proficient depiction of a contemporary Inferno, as aesthetically impressive as it is morally disturbing, a film of unparalleled barbarism, that also stands as one of the most extraordinary cinematic achievements in recent years. It's a work of genius. Twisted, sick, depraved genius, but genius nonetheless. It disturbed me like no film in at least a decade, and I couldn't get it out of my head for days afterwards. I absolutely loved every single crazy minute of it. And I never wish to see it again."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "WTF??????? Le film le plus horrible est nul que j\u2019ai vu!!!
