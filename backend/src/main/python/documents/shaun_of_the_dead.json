The film isn't scary, but the zombies do look freaky. An alright storyline and plot, and played well by the actors. The action scenes are good, mostly filled with comedy. It's violent, horrible and bloody, it's Shaun Of The Dead!"

And with the Zombie violence not too unbareable to watch, The movie really made you believe that it was really happening, and these two slackers were actually saving their little town. Overall this was a hilarious movie, with some good action, and probably one of the best endings in movie history. It's a definite must see and if you want to see some Zombies eatin' some brains and a good laugh, watch this movie."

      "text": "For a British film, Shaun of the Dead hits the spot, particularly as a lot of the horror movies have come from America, zombies in particular. Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright have written the film realistically and added in the homages and traits in a way that doesn't make it look too much like mass advertising or copying. Gore is bearable and the ending with the British Army culling the zombies has remained one of my all-time favourite horror movie scenes. While some of the jokes do not always appeal to all ages, the film largely increased my interest in the zombie genre. All in all, it makes a good homage and it's good to see Britain is capable of making good films after all."

It shaped the way we look at the horror/comedy genre and will continue to be at the top tier of the genre until another film like it is made. An absolute romp from start to finish that leaves you satisfied, but wanting more. A must see for horror, comedy, or movie lovers of the like."

      "text": "This has to be one the most original comedies in years. It mixes the genre of horror spectacularly with the comedy. With such a depressing subject which has been explored by people such as George A. Romero, it's not the first zombie comedy, but I do think it is the best. The lines are great, the irony is clever, and each scene leaves you with a smile. Edgar Wright is a brilliant director and I am a fan of his works that I've seen. What works in his movies is the characters are so realistic and you can immediately identify with them. An example would be Ed, he is such a jerk but he's the kind of friend you've known forever. I think everyone has had this type of friend in their life at one point or another. Edgar Wright also has great symmetry with his movies, such displayed early on with two near identical long takes, that are just beautiful to behold. Also nearly every line has a just payoff, making the dialogue also very clever. The comedy is hilarious, the characters are great, and the editing is fast-paced and brilliant which leaves this movie impossible to keep your eyes off."

As the first entry in Edgar Wright's Three Cornettos trilogy, it establishes a lot of ideas and elements that carry through all three films. The movie is thought provoking, sad when it needs to be sad, funny when it needs to be funny, and gory when it needs to be gory. There are a few slow scenes in the film, but this is a must-see for any zombie or comedy fan."

Every element works like gangbusters, never feeling disjointed. It's brilliantly directed by Edgar Wright in his feature debut. It's edited in such a way that's full of energy and cuts all fat from the edges. The cast sells the comedy and the drama. The action is tense, and you truly feel as if the characters are in danger. You care if they live or die.Wright and his co-writer Simon Pegg (who also stars in the film) clearly love the zombie genre, and they play around with its conventions in wonderfully hilarious ways, without ever making the film feel like a parody. The attention to detail is astounding. I've seen it countless times, and I discover something new with every viewing. An absolute blast from start to finish, this is one of the best zombie movies ever made."

It's about this man called Shaun (Simon Pegg) we can tell from the start of this movie he's not a very brave character and he get's talked over a lot but that later changes when the zombies start to appear.Also, throughout this movie we get to see the character of Shaun change from how he once was and it's done so well. The other characters throughout this movie are also great especially Ed (Nick Frost) he's a very hilarious character from start to finish and so is Shaun throughout this movie.The chemistry which Shaun and Ed have throughout this movie is honestly great, it's nicely displayed when they're either murdering a bunch of zombies together or just having some banter together in a pub, either way the two of them have got some great chemistry with each other throughout this movie.Finally, the movie's got some very cleverly done fight scenes but oh my god, they're very brutal, very gory and very bloody but they're amazingly well done. Also, the love interest which Shaun has got for Liz (Kate Ashfield) is built up very well and it's honestly great.Overall, Shaun Of The Dead is honestly a masterpiece and a half. The movie's got a great plot, brilliant and funny characters, a great love interest, bloody and gory fight scenes, the dialogue is honestly great and so is the acting from all the cast, it's honestly worth the watch."

However, their 2004 \"romzomcom\" shot them to stardom and single-handedly managed to revive British horror. Shaun is a young man working in an electrical store has a rocky relationship with his mum, his girlfriend Liz is on the verge of dumping him and his best mate Ed is a complete slob who spends his days on Shaun's couch playing videogames and drinking beer, When he finally decides to get off his feet and sort his life out, a zombie invasion takes place but Shaun merely sees it as another obstacle. When he rounds up his family and friends and takes them to his local pub to try and survive the night. A real treat for all fans of British comedy and at the same time a gorefest that harkens back to the days of Peter Jackson's Braindead. Bloody brilliant."
