The script is crap as well as the action sequences (Its like parodying those Bourne or Bond films). Aston Kutcher also performed terribly (His worst one yet). Most of all, the movie just doesn't know where to point its gun at; action or comedy? Don't watch it, noobs."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Kutcher and Heigl have the on screen chemistry comparable to a Hannah Montana episode. Heigl plays a familar role for her in the unassuming curious unintelligent brunette. The \"suave\" Kutcher totally fails at attempting ot play a vicious killer. After the meandering plot scatters around looking for some substance or direction you are left wondering  if this is a movie at all. Weak bland character development hits home like a game winning touchdown."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "The worst acting performance (in a movie) I've seen in my entire life. Kutcher is incredibly terrible in this one. His performance was the worst by an actor. The title does not fit to the whole (terribly bad) plot of the movie. One of the worst movies I've ever watched................."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Mindnumbingly boring and unfunny, \"Killers\" doesn't know what it wants to be, so it just throws a bunch of things that wouldn't necessarily work together onto the screen hoping movie audiences are too dumb to care."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "The film's title is right \"Killers\" kills fun and the jokes are dead, it's cheesy and predictable, the action is mediocre and the pacing is defective, the dialogue is lousy, also the score is cheap. The screenplay by Ted Griffin, Bob DeRosa is gigantic predicament but somehow they make the film fun and suspenseful, definitely what the summer doesn't need. Comedy director Robert Luketic's bland style of directing the action sequences is bad, it's like the film was directed by McG. Three years since the vacation to the French Riviera, Jen  (Katherine Heigl) enjoys the good life in the suburbia with her handsome husband Spencer  (played by Ashton Kutcher who gets a producing credit). That comes crashing down, however, when gunfire rings out after his 30th birthday, he has to tell Jen the truth that he's a spy. Heigl yet again plays the same shrew women character who always nags like she always does in her rom-coms, but the chemistry is there between her and Kutcher. Ashton Kutcher does a good job as this spy character but doesn't make it believe able though. Tom Selleck and Catherine O'Hara are fine in this film but they can't save this terribly made lousy material. Grade D+"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Ashton Kutcher plays a killer, but not the \"Psycho Killer\" that's promised in the trailer. Unwilling to put his screen image at risk, Kutcher doesn't kill with a gun, or knife, or even with his bare hands. The ex-\"That 70s Show\" star leaves the nail guns and chainsaws for Christian Bale to handle. Spencer is a nice psycho. The nicest psycho in Nice. The contract killer merely pushes a button, causing the helicopter he rigged with explosives to blow up. No arterial spray, not even a drop of the red stuff is spilled. Blood would remind the moviegoer that the American girl on vacation(played by Katherine Heigl) just had lunch with a sociopath. Modeled loosely after 007, the former star of \"Grey's Anatomy\"(and future Shelley Long), ends up looking like a Bond girl of a lesser god. Presuming that she's not a superlative lip reader, daddy's girl(daddy is played by Tom Selleck) should have heard the midair detonation of the chopper. Perhaps it's bad editing, the moviegoer thinks, since there's no reaction shot(on her, or anybody's part) to the earsplitting blast. \"Killers\" just proceeds on to the next scene. The editor, not the screenwriter, helps keep the secret of Spencer's nefarious trade from the unsuspecting tourist. For sure, bad editing confuses the moviegoer, back on American soil at the now-married couple's suburban home, where a near-death experience in their garage becomes a mystery, because it's unclear as to who's doing the shooting: the man in the kitchen(a knife-wielding man), or the woman at the front door(a woman, as it turns out, was the only neighbor not trying to kill the Aimes unit). So where does the itchy trigger finger come from? Personally speaking, the bullet-riddled attempt on Spencer's life is practically extra-diegetic, a transmogrifying assailment from the moviegoer who wants a simple shot/reverse shot for the sake of clarity. If my aim was true, the chemistry-free pair(Kutcher and Heigl are no Chris Franz and Tina Weymouth) would be stopped, dead in their tracks, from riffing on Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 2\", in which a delicate domestic matter starts to encroach on the protagonist's wild, wild life. \"Killers\" has an edge all right, a dull one. \"Killers\" is no \"Grosse Point Blank\". John Cusack played a character that had the conviction of a cold-blooded killer. It's a trait that Spencer needs to make his transformation into a pillar of the community mean something."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "A comedy full of breathtaking action."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Can we finally be done with Ashton Kutcher and his utter lack of talent for acting?

It's a step up for Ashton \"Douche Face\" Kutcher's usual roles. It seems his acting has improved slightly over the years since Dude Where's My Car.If you must watch it, watch it for what it is... a **** movie. There is no greater message, there is no expert writing or masterful soundtrack.  No scene that invokes any kind of emotion. It's just a lame romantic comedy just like the 400 million other ones also in existence.So, if you just want to watch a movie that you can forget later because it doesn't really matter anyways. This one is for you."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "I honestly didn't know what to think of this when I was watching it. Parts of it I like and other parts made no sense and annoyed the hell out of me (like why no one could F'n kill the main characters??).

The plot was not great but the cast was good.

This tightly paced film was reminiscent of mr and mrs smith. It's got same levels of high octane action and amusing scenes. Aston is surprisingly good and Katherine is as lovely as ever. The South of France scenes are beautifully shot, although the roads are never that quiet. This was a fun action comedy  nothing amazing, but decent enough, and certainly better than the above metascores imply."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Because I accidentally gave it a 10...a 0 should average it out.

What could have been a fun and charming action/comedy flick, Killers is nothing more than an awkward, careless, silly, and unbelievable film that fails miserably.

I think it was a great acting, at first, I admit it was a little so, but took a big turn in events. I think the plot was great, as the acting. Perfect roles for Kutcher, at first I didn't think it was the right role for Heigl but she played in well. This movie should have a sequel."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "I was disappointed. I love the Katherine Heigl movies, but in the end I was like: \"Okay, so it was just that?\". I did not like the concept of this movie. Ashton Kutcher and Katherine Heigl had a good chemistry, but the plot is weak even the movie is cool."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "I went in without any knowledge of the story or the horrible reviews, and I mostly liked it.  It starts to get absurd about two thirds in, ultimately pushing from comedic to tedious, but there were enough enjoyable moments along the way that I think it deserved a better rating than the critics gave it.  I think Krutcher does a creditable job, and that they give a believable performance as a couple.  This doesn't compare to Mr.  Mrs. Smith, but for undemanding folks who really enjoyed that movie, I think this movie is worth a weeknight's rental."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "What an awful film. How could anyone have read this script and thought it would be good? I really dislike Heigl's acting (she tried her best to ruin Knocked Up) and with a poor script she stood no chance. Ashton Kutcher was below his normal standards too meaning this film was doomed. Also, the whole spy story film has been worn out and only the best can really succeed in this genre."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "You're kidding right?
