Unlike the 'Taken' trilogy, where Neeson actually carried the whole movie himself, here we have the excellent Ed Harris, whose character takes a big chunk of the weight off of Neeson, although he is still the main focus of the movie.\r With a touch of aesthetically crafted details and scenes, 'Run All Night' offers both drama and action, a touching and thrilling story with classical action film elements. Although the latter causes a visible lack of originality plot-wise and a series of (stereo)typical elements, the former is so powerfully crafted that you're actually able to disregard the majority of those elements.\r Certainly, although you'll be able to predict the ending quite early on, 'Run All Night' is a movie worth watching, because of Neeson and Harris, if nothing else.

The plot was very good and the acting was excellent. Maybe the problem is that an action movie must have an element of schlock or novelty or it isn\u2019t appealing these days.

I would see it again."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Well its not Taken and its not quite tombstones but its def a liam neeson movie. Which is a good thing but its really a bit of a reach to give it a 8.... 7.5 borderline may be too but it does enough cool camera junk to get the nudge. Harris is good but gets a little lost in the shuffle."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Let me just say it's very refreshing to see Liam Neeson play something other than \"the bad ass that everybody likes.\" However as I watched it kept seeming more and more like a generic action movie. But, the movie had some very interesting characters that later tie into the plot to save yourself from feeling that."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Yes I know this review is late but March has been a slow month for me with movies not playing at my location theater, it's a pain in the ass sometimes but hey I finally got a chance to watch it and this is what I have to say about.\r The story to Run All Night is about a prolific and aging hitman, Jimmy Conlon, once known as The Gravedigger, has fallen on hard times. With the sins of his past catching up, he finds out his estranged son has been targeted by his former mob boss and must now choose between the crime family he grew up with or the family he left behind.\r I think I was like everybody else when I sawed the trailer to Run All Night thinking it was another copy cat of Taken with Liam Neeson playing the same character. With all these movie with Liam Neeson playing pretty much the same character in every movie his in is getting a bit old now and his movies now I would call them The Liam Neeson film with action and bullets flying everywhere. Now I don't hate Liam Neeson I actually freaking love the guy he's awesome and his really funny when his mad.\r After the long search for this movie and finally viewing it I was actually surprise that this wasn't another Taken movie and more of a movie that can stand on it's own feet as a revenge thriller with a lot of good things in it.\r Liam Nesson in this movie isn't just playing himself this time, he's actually got a character ark in this movie and his character isn't all perfect but more damage and understandable. Liam Nesson did a great performance showing all the pain and sadness from his character and Liam nailed it because well this shows you that Liam Nesson...is a great actor. Liam Nesson character is the kind of character that I think we all can relate to when he isn't perfect but he's trying his hardest to make things right but it doesn't quite work out, we had that in are life's and it may not happened to you yet but it will do sooner or late, and as I said before Liam pulled it off excellently.\r Ed Harris was also great in this movie as he added a lot to his character just like Nesson. I think Liam Nesson and Ed Harris back and forward with each other and how both of them stare each other down, sh*t talking to each other and ready to attack and the movie took a whole scene to show that and it was like art house brilliant for two characters who are both damage to bounce off each other with their emotions really made one heck of a show.\r The directing of the movie I thought did a great job directing characters and actions scenes. The writing in the movie that can be cliche at times but still has some bad-ass lines that will crack a smile on your face or leave you in silence.\r The title of the movie doesn't lie at all, the movie is literally set on one night and everyone is always moving around and nobody get's a break everything's always moving. This is what action movie plot should be like and Run All Night gives you that plot that isn't stupid but more creative for what they had.\r Now for problems I do have some like: There are so many things going on in this movie with the cops, mob bosses, drug dealers, Ed Harris, Liam Nesson mid life crisis and may god these so many things happening and it feels a bit crushed together at time for how many things they wanted to show.\r But overall I had a good time watching Run All Night and I was surprise how it didn't turn into the cliche Liam Nesson action movie that's trying way to hard to be Taken. The movie actually had character ark, a good story to it and a solid cast and actors that pulled off a great performance in this surprisingly good movie."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Run All Night is the third collaboration between director Jaume Collet-Serra and Liam Neeson (the first two being Unknown and Non-Stop) and this may be their strongest film yet. The movie has a fairly strong cast composed of Neeson, Ed Harris, Joel Kinnaman and several other strong actors in the supporting cast like Vincent D'Onofrio and Common. Run All Night is a action film that is as classic as they come. Neeson is a character you generally care about and he is vulnerable at points in the movie where in the last installments in the Taken series it seemed as if he was invincible. Ed Harris also has a strong performance in the film and its nice to see him as the evil one as it seems like he is normally a good guy in most cases. However, one of may problems with the film is that there are two many important players in the film. You get the  Mafia, the police, and an assassin all at once and although that's pretty cool there are points where it seems like it too much. Still its well worth checking out and its a rare March theatre gem. If you are a fan of action movies this movie is a safe bet."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Definitely one of the better movies I've seen in a while. A good old-fashioned ganster shoot-em-up type movie with an interesting story, engaging characters, and great acting. The action was very realistic and believable to an extent. It was gritty and somewhat dark. Neeson is awesome as usual. Not much to complain about really. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Highly recommend if you like a \"realistic\" action movie with good story elements."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Run All Night is a gritty, pulse pounding and engaging thriller, that is Serra's best colab with Neeson. The story is fantastic, it is well written and acted brilliantly by Liam Neeson, Ed Harris, Joel Kinnaman and hell, even Common. The camera angles are TRIPPY, the most interesting cinematography I have seen in a movie. Overall, the sick action, great story, beautiful cinematography and the brilliant writing make for a darker, more  psychologicaly handled action thriller. Way better than Tombstones."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "In what might be Liam Neeson's finest action vehicle since 2008's \"Taken,\" Jaume Collet-Serra spins a sleek and memorable yarn of redemption, complicated fatherhood, and survival filled with committed performances and arresting set pieces."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "It's definitely a remake of 'Road to perdition(2002)' with modern-era-recipient. But, 4 stars (2 fathers, 2 sons) act brilliant, touching and emotional. I gave 7 for their awesome act."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Thirty years have passed, the competition is gone, the cops are off their backs, for a mob boss and his hit-man, every thing is peaceful. Until one night, when their adult children come into conflict. One commits a murder, the other is a witness, and when one of them ends up dead, the family is torn apart with one on the run and the other on his heels. It honestly took me a while to watch this movie, because I was tired of Liam Neeson and his very particular set of skills, but his character wasn't what I expected. While not having the popularity of Taken, Neeson's performance in this film, was better than any performance he's given in an action film to date. Paired with the ultimate crime boss, Ed Harris, and The Killing's Joel Kinnaman, this movie had a cast that couldn't fail. Watching this compelling story, I couldn't help but think that this would have been an amazing ending for the Sopranos. Run All Night was surprising in the way that it was done, because it wasn't your typical mafia movie, but it wasn't an action film either. The writers very cleverly combined elements of both to combine the thrilling action of a Falling Down, with the crime story of a really good Sopranos episode. The film wasn't just about the incident and the chase and that's why it was special. They even managed to get Law & Order's Vincent D'Onofrio to play the lead detective in the case, and we all know the intensity he can bring to a role. It was a slow start and a somewhat predictable ending, but in the middle, Run All Night was so good, that I could have stayed up and kept watching it all night."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Neeson is good at it, none other would've played better than him.\r Pretty entertaining action flick with a fast paced narration. A typical Liam Neeson's movie. Take a gun and go hunt down the bad guys or protect loved ones from them kind of movie. Under his league, like always he was awesome. This has been a already heard story, like a trivia say. Yes, it was similar to 'Road to Perdition', but happens for a different reason and with the different cast. Still the movie was better that I expected.\r I went speechless when I saw Neeson was begging in the opening scene. Because that's not his style, action heroes like him, Jason Statham, Bruce Willis et cetera, they don't fit in those roles. But what came just a few minutes later was like switching to second, third, fourth and fifth gear in a quick session. You know you can't judge a book by its cover, same applies for this as well. The film was good, I mean better than average, better than ratings and reviews across the web.\r It was kind of unofficial 'A Man with a Gun' trilogy (I made it up) after 'Unknown' and 'Non-stop'. Because if you check it out all these three film's posters, Neeson will be seen with a gun in the similar fashion. Hope this director and actor comes together to do more movies in the future, since it is a rocking combo. Well, they all might not be the masterpieces, but enjoyable at the time of the watch. Especially it will not disappoint Neeson's fans.\r 7/10"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Neeson has found a director who he can continue to hit solid doubles with.

This time, he has to protect his estranged son (Kinnaman) who has been the next target of a mob boss and his longtime best friend played by Ed Harris. Would Neeson and Collet-Serra's third installment make a decent successor to Unknown and Non-Stop for a trilogy of action-thriller?Well, if you had pleasure with the two mentioned movies, then you'll probably have an enjoyable time watching Liam Neeson kicking asses in one night. It's greatly acted with well-developed characters and tightly written with exciting moments that help the pace moving properly. Furthermore, it consistently keeps the depth and substance all throughout the movie by particular scenes revolving around family, regret and redemption.As for flaws, the plot can get convoluted and too jumbled at times for its own terms. Also, Common's character feels a little bit out-of-place for the totality of the film.VERDICT: Neeson and Harris face off in a lusterless movie that centers around family, regret and redemption."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "What can I say. This movie suffers from a complete lack of character development or background, poor scripting a honestly laughable direction, especially as far as the animated scene transitions are concerned. Liam Neeson plays what is essentially an even more two dimensional version of himself, with no noticeably great acting performances from elsewhere. long story short, this film really shouldn't have made the box office, and it makes me sad that so many far superior others could have taken its place if it wasn't for its starring actor. No, seriously, without Liam's name to this film I can practically guarantee it would have gotten nowhere."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Jaume Collet-Serra and Liam Neeson's latest collaboration once again shows that a good story can really help to take an action-thriller to new heights. There's a lot going on the plot. Plenty of dialog fleshes out the dark and solemn story, characters, and world. It doesn't skip out on the drama. The movie gives Neeson a chance to flex his acting muscles just as much as his action scene ones.\r As far as the action scenes go they are quite tense. Brutal shootouts, a fast car chase, and some hand-to-hand combat all are made to feel fresh thanks to the occasional awesome camera angle. Serra shoots scenes in cool ways here. It helps the action which could have felt overly familiar feel fresh instead.\r The entire cast gives fantastic performances. There are quite a few characters here acting from different roles that tie together into one cohesive whole. Usually in Neeson movies it's just him stealing the show. Here though there are other actors to keep your attention. Including particularly cool villains in Ed Harris and rapper \"Common\" (Lonnie Rashid Lynn Jr.).\r It's a particularly grim action-thriller. Part Taken and part A Walk Among the Tombstones with it's own cool ideas thrown in. The results are one of the more exciting action-thrillers to come out in quite a while. It's a wild ride all the way through that doesn't sacrifice any aspect of it's storytelling. It' a dynamite thriller and one of the best films of 2015.\r I give this movie a 9.2/10."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This may look like just another Liam Neeson's flick after Taken, understandably so with his usual look and its revenge premise, but worry not, Run All Night has enough substantial material and gritty crime ambiance to entertain. In a more convincing noir set-up, the movie gives Liam Neeson more range on his character, while still keeping his more well-known persona of action star. It justifiably takes more time to establish the premise to ensure this is more than just a random shooting spree.\r Jimmy Conlon (Liam Nesson) has been an enforcer for mob boss Shawn Maquire (Ed Harris) for decades. He has done many terrible things, but when his son Michael (Joel Kinnaman) is unfortunately embroiled in the mafia's shady dealings, Jimmy must decide where his loyalty lies. This concept of veteran gunslinger who must fight once more is admittedly used by the recent Equalizer and John Wick, however Run All Night opts for more family issue than flair to create a different yet equally engaging effect.\r Acting is pretty well done, action fans must be familiar with Neeson's performance by now. Ed Harris and Joel Kinnaman provide what was missing from Taken series, this is not your average rescue operation. It's a perspective of camaraderie relationship, a strange brother-in-arms dilemma Neeson's character had to deal with both his longtime friend and also his son. Harris is charismatic as always, while Kinnaman from Robocop and The Killing TV series, is splendid as the young son. He looks rugged, but still act upstanding enough for a contrast on the mob life.\r The dynamic works in crime or gangster thriller. It also boasts gray visual, akin to 90s mystery movie. This near exclusive darkness is a bit daunting since it may hamper the fast paced action, but it does create the authentic feel of the city and its underlying often neglected lifestyles. The movie knows exactly what it wants to accomplish with its theme and confidently portrays it with the gritty visual.\r Pacing is mostly good, although it staggers a bit in midway point. A few scenes feel as though they are a bit glossed over, probably for the sake of pushing the tempo towards the latter halt, these sequences could be explored more. Action is plausible, each fired shot, especially the one that hits, carries more weight. This is not Liam Neeson going Rambo all night, but a meticulous firework show.\r Run All Night makes good use of the actors' charisma and the sordid gangster tone in creating a fray from dusk till dawn."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This is the common fugitive runaway movie, but still, it's pretty cool.

I'm a \"good guys must always win\" type and don't like seeing good guys die indiscriminately, even if lots of bad guys die too unless it means something.

I could have gone the next day and sat thru the entire movie again and enjoy it as if I first seen it. A mob type movie that would have made the Mafia proud. Neeson said once in an interview that he is getting to old to be on the screen as a tough guy beating the hell out of two people at the same time. He may be in his sixties but it sure doesn't show on the screen. He pulls off the tough guy effortlessly. If you enjoyed the \"Taken\" series you'll walk away from RAN completely satisfied.

Certes, ce n'est pas Heat mais on sent une inspiration assez nette \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.Si l'histoire tient ma foi tout-\u00e0-fait debout, elle titube sensiblement dans la psychologie de ses personnages trop exag\u00e9r\u00e9e, trop forc\u00e9e et le sc\u00e9nario qui aligne poursuites et bastons sans crier gare est du m\u00eame acabit : on se sent un peu trop souvent dans une stathamerie ou autre production Luc Besson, ce qui n'est pas un compliment, non, non...Pour autant, on ne s'ennuie jamais l\u00e0-dedans et nos vieux donnent le meilleur d'eux-m\u00eames, Liam et Ed en premier : leur exp\u00e9rience cr\u00e8ve l'\u00e9cran. On passerait m\u00eame l'\u00e9ponge sur le caract\u00e8re outrancier du film si sa r\u00e9alisation \u00e9tait au moins \u00e0 la hauteur, ce qu'elle n'est pas avec son montage cut et zoom\u00e9, rendant l'action confuse et d\u00e9sordonn\u00e9e.Il reste un film pas d\u00e9sagr\u00e9able avec quelques moments touchants mais globalement d\u00e9pass\u00e9 par son ambition : la r\u00e9demption du truand est en effet un sujet difficile et d\u00e9licat qui ne souffre pas la m\u00e9diocrit\u00e9... Trop emport\u00e9, Night Run n'a pas acquis la sagesse n\u00e9cessaire."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Without fear a film of pure action and is all that this offers, nothing different but also not that bad.

The writer Brad Ingelsby fascinates me. His writing procedure, his character and the way they travel in his plot tracks is equally intriguing. They take detours, they take uncalled stops, they bump into randomness and they also ask us to stop this everlasting train. And I know I usually give credit, at first. to the director who in this case is Jaume Collet-Serra. I just wanted to swoon over Brad's filmography and how it has caught my eye over the years. Not that I have anything new to add to those already said and observed things. This project, the stereotypical action thriller and it is extremely typical in its genre, has something else that I'd loved and exhaled over. It is its irrelevantly fast edited scenarios.And not some physical action sequence but even a conversation is crisply edited out. No. Not crisply, but wrongly. Multiple times we can see the dialogues lapped over physical sequences to pace up the film in a briskly adventurous night. What it instead results into is a disappointing questionable set of scenarios that doesn't respect anything. Neither the action nor the characters nor the actors and what they are diving or dying or performing for is accounted into a disrespectful character.Character, I say, for it repeatedly pops up on screen and also has his own arc in the sense that it gets less and less visible and annoying. Run All Night seems, is simply terribly edited. It cuts to another frame within a blink or like a blink. It feels unintentional, wrong and doesn't quite add up. There is a disturbance between conversation. This violence is much louder than any other explosives and bangs. And on the other hand, the final act is incredibly slow and settling which in its own way makes up for that uncalled editing that jumps back and forth."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25a0\u2664\u25a0\u2664\u25a0\u2664\u25a0\u2664\u25a0\u2664\u25a0\u2664\u25a0\u2664\u25a0\u2664$&$&$&$&$&$&$&$&$&$&$&$&$&$&+.+.+.+.+.+.+.+.+.+.+.+.+.+"}], "recommendations": ["a_walk_among_the_tombstones", "the_mechanic", "the_equalizer", "the_commuter", "angel_has_fallen", "street_kings", "nobody", "wrath_of_man", "3_days_to_kill", "contraband", "safe_house", "the_equalizer_2", "parker", "16_blocks", "mechanic_resurrection", "the_accountant", "the_italian_job", "wild_card", "taken", "21_bridges", "homefront", "miami_vice", "premium_rush", "rocknrolla", "creed_ii"]}
