In the end the film ends up being OK, but it's probably forgettable, for a similar plotline you should probably just watch Fargo, and there's countless examples of films that explore similar themes to this one as well. You can tell why the Coen Brothers didn't want to do this themselves."

      "text": "Now here's a prime example of a movie trailer spoiling its own movie. Every scene that might contain a tiny bit of comedy has been shoved into the trailer in a desperate attempt to try find an audience for Suburbicon. So if like me your curiosity gets the better of you not only will you be able to predict absolutely everything before it happens but you'll be able to do it all while not laughing.A home invasion and a murder in the lovely, tranquil town of Suburbicon. Starring Matt Damon doing his best to give an angry and slightly psychotic performance which ends up looking like he doesn't even want to be in the movie. Also starring Julianne Moore doing her super smiley unnerving performance, again and Oscar Isaac, who by a long shot is the best thing in Suburbicon. Such a short moment and he makes every second count. For a black comedy to work it needs to find the balance between humour and a dark story. Well Suburbicon sure found the darkness alright but it's so far away from funny as it can possibly get. Every time a character says their apparent funny line they almost pause after it as if waiting for you to laugh. Waiting for a laugh that never happens. It never once found the balance, instead you're left watching scene after scene where you know exactly how it will play out because you've already seen enough of it beforehand and provided you haven't fallen asleep you can figure out the rest for yourself.If Suburbicon had lost all the attempts at comedy and just restricted itself to a dark thriller we might have gotten a better movie. As a whole it does not piece itself together, the tone is all over the place so the end result is a mess that just leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Directed by George Clooney with a Coen Brothers script, sorry guys this one just doesn't work. Not recommended unless you really have nothing else to watch."

Takes place in 50's suburbia, and though the story is really about a crazy white family the writers threw in terrible race issues of that time; shouting meetings, neighbors harassing the 1 colored family on the street, all without taking any time to develop any positiveness of the characters, so much could have been done there!  The beginning (1st 20 mins or so) was so boring I heard a man down the row ask his buddy if be brought a deck of cards so they could play!  Things do pick up & the story took a twist we didn't see coming.  Definitely had it's moments, though not nearly enough.  Damon was good, Moore was part just crazy & part Stepford, Noan Jupe who played Damons son Nicky was very good (expect to see him in the more movies) & Oscar Issac, who plays a sleazy insurance investigator, was also really good. Did not enjoy this film, there was so much that could have been done, but it was just kind of stupid & sad and we were very disappointed!  Major highlight of the movie was the cars - beautiful! - really the whole 50's era settings; cars, props, clothes, hair, etc. were done extremely well."

I have never seen Julianne Moore give a bad performance but here as a combination Stepford wife, throw in a little of Kim Novak from \u201cVertigo\u201d  and Barbara Stanwyck in \u201cDouble Indemnity\u201d and you feel this is a new actress who won\u2019t be heard from again.The four screenwriters: Joel Coen, Ethan Coen, George Clooney and Grant Heslov each seem to have another genre from the other plus different movie homage\u2019s, if they could be called that. In addition Clooney directed and among fight, murder and mayhem he throws in a physical joke that at least gets a laugh as wanted.The reason I went to see the movie was because of Matt Damon and Julianne Moore and having already talked about Moore I have to say that I hope his next film, \u201cDownsizing\u201d is a hit because after \u201cThe Great Wall\u201d and this film Damon needs one. Matt Damon is Matt Damon here, Fred McMurray there, a little Jason Bourne and, why not?, some of good Will hunting.With a cast of strong supporting players \u201cSuburbicon\u201d doesn\u2019t make a strong film considering the best storyline about a Black family being the first to move into a 1950s \u2018lily white\u2019 area is sort of neglected, especially the friendship between the young boys of the two families played by Noah Jupe and Tony Espinosa.Not bad enough to be on a \u2018worst list of 2017\u2019 it certainly isn\u2019t good enough to be recommended."

It's unfathomable that Matt Damon, Julianne Moore, and Oscar Isaac signed up for this film. The white guilt, race divisions of the 50s theme is so formulaic that it's insulting to anyone who bought a ticket for this film. And what's worse, is that the social commentary is only a subplot with the non-existent characters, and the rest of the cast is completely one-dimensional themselves. The murder thriller thing is like a miscarriage of 'Fargo' and 'Mississippi Burning.' It's one of the worst films I've seen in a long, long time. If anyone reads this, save your money, and your time. You'll never get either back after watching 'Suburbicon.'"

Suburbicon is a slap in the face to the American establishment of suburban perfection which only exemplifies a lie. It's not that it's generalizing but in a way what we see on screen is a reflection of what is currently happening. The moral and social rot comes from oneself, not by races or different cultures, after all we see a couple of color in a white suburb and those who behave like animals are the whites who boast so much of their advanced mentality.But the strength of its message does not save the film and George Clooney delivers an empty film that even with the Cohen's script fails to be fully saved.I'm not saying that Suburbicon is a failure, but it is a disappointment, partly because it's was filme in a simplistic way, of all its cast the only person who seems to be putting a little more effort is Julianne Moore. Matt Damon looks uncomfortable during the whole movie and he creates one of the most forgettable roles of his entire career.Its rhythm is very slow and although you infer very soon what is happening, Suburbicon spends almost an hour to become a more interesting and fluid story, you're gotta need patience."

George Clooney does a OK job of bringing the film to screen nonetheless, though the film is somewhat muddled by his own rewrites and attempts to add a second storyline, about racial tension. Some neat scenes, jokes and thematic expression does come across through now this second storyline now and again, but for the most part it feels like more of an intrusion than organic addition to the rest of the film, and it only serves to further muddy the rest of the plot.The acting is alright, the music is alright. There's a nice animated intro and the production design is gorgeous.In the end the film ends up being OK, but it's probably forgettable, for a similar plotline you should probably just watch Fargo, and there's countless examples of films that explore similar themes to this one as well.

But I went in and indeed I can understand the criticism behind it. what we've got was a movie filled with unlikable characters with no depth or redeeming qualities whatsoever. That it's why the movie fell flat and felt like a missed opportunity in all fronts. As a satire, as a dark comedy or as a political statement. The actors seem out of place with the material and the script seems like a B-Side from Fargo, with none of its charisma nor its relatable lead. The performances are bland, unconvincing and forgettable performances. Suburbicon at its core is a dark comedy. But I think for these troubled times that we're living politically becomes a bad joke, an unnecessary one as well, because the Racial Issues that the film tries to raise leads to nowhere, it's just convenient to the story. There's no relevance It's just a plot device, poorly executed and insulting to my knowledge. Sadly a disappointment."

      "text": "its birth isn't luxury but a co-operative necessity..Suburbicon Suburbicon is a character driven drama about a family that faces an unfortunate event and the trauma that it goes through it later. The perspective is the queen of Clooney's chess board in here and he plays it well enough to keep the craft and crisp parallel among the storytelling. But this is the sort of crisp that makes you nod at best twice, not the cinematic level, it's not glorifying enough to claim its own cards; no matter what does that background score suggest. Also its repetitiveness shucks away the scared element out of it and leaves it the baffled and bourgeois attempts of, literally, failure. As mentioned, the background score is exhilarating and calming equally, the cinematography is impressive and so is its editing and camera work that helps give this feature all the boost it can; its a drop in the ocean, though. Damon's performance is appreciative, if not his best and so is the case of Moore which comes off more disappointing, unfortunately. The relationships that ought to create impact goes down the drain vigorously and the one that ought to make amends, shatters the expectations; it's a misconceived act. The structure of the script is undoubtedly fresh and doesn't follow any textbook logistics and so does its narrative, but as much as gripping it is, it is also off putting on its sadistic terms. The finiteness of the moot point it thrives on never had the potential to make it in the first place after which no matter how much effort Clooney, has to offer. The uniqueness of its bubble is questionable since its birth isn't luxury but a co-operative necessity. Suburbicon is what happens when a colony is left to run on merit of the basis of the foundation agendas, if to err is to human, then so is to evolve."

The actors did a decent job, more or less but the kid was really good, plus Clooney knows how to direct his movies, which is always good, but that wasn't enough to save the movie from and average rating. The visual and sound effect look pretty good, and the sound plays a rather big role in immersing the viewer. The humor was a big fail, and the pacing of the movie is just downright awful, and it takes too much for the plot to really take off, it just breaks the immersion. The plot was delivered that it reflects on the problems of the 'great america' and people's stupidity but went really down the drain as the plot was only a shallow story. Overall it's an average movie, which could have been so much more better if executed in the right way, and gave the right conclusion and message at the end."

This film isn't the worst movie in the world, it isn't nearly as bad as people make it out to be. There are some bright spots in this. Matt Damon is good with what he's given. Julianne Moore and Oscaar Isaac put on some fun performances as well. The main issue with this movie is the directing and writing from George Clooney. It seems like the Cohen Brothers gave him a half finished remixed script of Fargo and said have fun with it. Suburbicon tries to bring forth a subplot dealing with racism in the 50's that doesn't fit well at all in the story. It's incredibly disingenuous  and they don't pull it off subtly at all. The subplots misplacement is unbearably glaring that it's hard to believe that professional film makers didn't notice is worthlessness. My final thought on this film is that all these actions, this plot, this story leads to absolutely nothing. It's mindless entertainment. These characters have no motivations. We hardly know anything about them or why they do the things they do, and in a film like this, that's unforgivable. Brights spots and all, it's hard to get over all the flaws in this film, a disappointing watch and a let down on potential. 45/100"

Little Nicky Lodge (Noah Jupe, the notable actor from A Quiet Place and The Undoing) lives there with his parents Rose and Gardner (Julianne Moore and Matt Damon). After an African-American family moves into the house next to hers, an unexpected series of family incidents begins.When in the final titles one reads that the co-writers of this George Clooney film are him and the Cohen brothers, one says \u201cah, of course!\u201d).After the prologue with the new black neighbors moving, the film focuses on the Lodge family and an incident they suffer shortly after, setting in motion a typical Cohen thriller, with characters making bad decisions, outbursts of humor fierce, despicable characters and the sinister and violence taking over everything.The film initially recreates the aesthetics and tone of the melodrama of the 50s and then darkens and darkens the story, supported by Alexander Desplat's great \u201cvintage\u201d soundtrack, the performances, which give the right tone and Hitchcockian touches. A sort of counterpart to Far from Paradise by Todd Haynes (reinforced by the presence in both of Julianne Moore).With this remarkable drama (whose title Suburbicon probably alludes to Lovecraft's Necronomicon), sliding into thriller with hints of black comedy, George Clooney proceeds to a relentless and at times bizarre demolition of the American dream and family, transforming them into a nightmare.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026."
