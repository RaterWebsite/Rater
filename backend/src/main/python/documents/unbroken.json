Angelina Jolie is directing her first big film with Unbroken. The movie had a lot of hype but it didn't impress me. The movie was too long and there were long periods of time where nothing exciting was happening. I didn't care much for the cast either. Jack O'Connell is still a young actor but I felt that his role needed a better performance. Takamasa Ishihara was very strong as the main antagonist in the film. He was certainly good at making me hate him. Overall this film could have been a lot better."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Angelina botched this film. It had no inspiration, left out the last part of his life which was what I was looking to see. Instead I was stuck with what seemed like stock war film footage of being stranded at sea and brutality at a Japanese POW camp. How many times have you see that already? Did she run out of budget and couldn't tell the post war part of life? What she did show was flat and motionless, no peaks, no valleys. A major disappointment."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "First of all I must admit, that I'm not a fan of Angelina Jolie. In fact, I never liked her. Moreover, after reading some negative reviews here I didn't expect much from her movie. However Zamperini's story (about whom I never heard before) interested me, so I decided to spend couple of hours of my life watching \"Unbroken\".\r And I was really surprised - first hour of the movie is wonderful, both visually and substantively. I felt effect of presence in depicted scenes - in the bomber, falling apart from fighters fire, under the scorching sun on a raft with starving men lost in the Pacific Ocean. Second movie's part failed to hold the level. It is still well made, but something was missed there - some intensity or nerve - yet \"it\" was found again near the end of the movie. And it shed light on why the Bird refused to met Zamperini again. In the end, the one who was broken, was \"breaker\" Watanabe, not his victim. It was the Bird, who didn't dare to watch in Zamperini's eyes. Good point from Jolie and new, practical perspective on Christian doctrine of forgiveness. Well, where credit is due it must be given. So credit to Jolie."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This movie definitely deserves a positive review. It's a mixture of everything good: It relateable on a historical level, personal level, emotional and spiritual level. I won't say more, but that the movie is worth seeing."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Angelina shows real talent in her second film as director. Based on the true events surrounding Louie Zampirini during WW2, \"Unbroken\" acts a testament to human strength and willpower. It shows that even during the worst of scenarios so long as one can persevere they can overcome. Or, as the film puts it, \"if you can take it you can make it.\"\r The horror of his captivity in a Japanese POW camp as well as the hopelessness of being lost at sea. It's resourcefulness and shear strength that kept him going and it's just uplifting to watch. It doesn't show anything about how these events effected him after the war. Instead it chooses to focus on the more empowering aspects of his story.\r What might be Jolie's biggest success with this movie is in the casting of newcomer Jack O'Connell as the lead. He might not show the necessary emotions during some of the earlier scenes, but as the events kick off we see him play a character who is weary and withered, but somehow still strong to near-perfection.\r It's a war drama that takes place during a familiar period, but still manages to be fresh and enjoyable thanks to a great story. Some might find disappointment in the fact that it doesn't capture all of the man's life, but if you keep in mind this is meant to be both a biographical movie as well as one meant for entertaining a wider audience then you should still enjoy it.\r I give \"Unbroken\" a 9.2/10."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "An uninspiring sluggish film that has corniness written all over it. Jolie rushes through the early life of the man, shows the guy living through hell and ends on a flat note. What Zamperini went through was a tragedy and sadly was the way this film was made."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "After a relatively slow and uninteresting start, that is both trite and dull, UNBROKEN really takes off and becomes quite a stunner. The film does something so rare--combining the horror of war as experienced by it's victims and the victimization of it's villains. This brutal film, does an astonishing job of depicting both the courage of man and our petty evil. Angelina Jolie has made a fine and complex film that seems glossy and \"Hollywood\" on the surface but is actually something quite different underneath. Like Jolie's first film, THE LAND OF BLOOD AND HONEY, there is a humanity so strong it will haunt you."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The non-fiction novel Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption is an incredibly riveting, moving biography of Olympian and prisoner-of-war Louis Zamperini that I believe is an important book to read. Naturally, a movie based on the book was inevitable; the film adaptation does do its subject justice, even if it's only sporadically compelling. Unbroken is a bio-pic about the life of Louie Zamperini in World War II, whose bomber plane was shot down, and he was forced to survive on a raft for 47 days. He was then captured by the Japanese and placed in various camps for over two years, where he was severely abused until he was rescued at the end of the war. There are a lot of great things about Unbroken: the spectacular cinematography, breakout performances from the entire cast, an explosive opening act and some genuinely moving scenes throughout the rest of the film. Angelina Jolie directs the film in a surprisingly graceful way. Despite some obviously unpleasant war scenes present in the film, Unbroken is a beautiful movie to look at. An opportunity that the film misses, however, is the effects of the war on Louie. His battle with alcoholism and PTSD is never mentioned in the film, and although it would have made the movie longer than it already is (137 minutes), there should have been an emphasis on those ideas. Even if it doesn't resonate as strongly as it should, Unbroken is compelling enough to do justice to its subject matter and a must-watch if yo're a fan of World War II movies."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "\"Unbroken\" 10 Scale Rating: 7.0 (Good) ...\r The Good: An interesting true story that is well acted. Jack O'Connell was especially great in bringing former Olympian turned POW, Louie Zamperini, to the big screen. From happy-go-lucky, to broken, to resilient and defiant ... O'Connell runs the gamut of emotions and pulls it off brilliantly. Assisting O'Connell along the way is a great cast. Domhnall, Garrett Hedlund, and Miyavi were fantastic.\r The Bad: Unfortunately, the film starts to buckle under it;s own weight. Just over halfway through, it slows to a crawl and becomes far less interesting. I was less fascinated with the story at this point and found myself just wanting to skip to the film's conclusion. It's a shame too because this is where the story itself should have really taken off ... but it didn't."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "All right,\rI'm going to write this as joe/Jo moviegoer. I thought it was a really good film.  The movie followed the book pretty well and thus it told a great story. I don't understand some critics comment on Ms Jolie concentrating too much on cruelty--that's a large part of what Zamperini's  experience is about . I was never bored during this long movie.  In the theater in which I saw the movie, the audience spontaneously applauded at the end. So if you're an average moviegoer like me, you'll probably enjoy the movie."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I was very moved by the film and came out of the theator in tears.  I thought of my father and the veterans he would meet for coffee in the morning and swap war stories.  I understand now.  Those veterans shared with each other things that they were reluctant to share with others who could not understand.  My only concern was that the hair and beards rarely grew!  I would think their heads would be shaved in a POW camp because of lice. But the emaciation of the actors was powerful!"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "When I heard that this film was directed by Angelina Jolie, I had my doubts about how good it could get to be, knowing her much more for being an actress than a director. But when I finally watched, all my doubts were erased, because this movie is pretty good. It tells the true story of a young man that, being an Olympic athlete, was caught and retained as a war prisoner by Japan in the World War II; and all the things that he had to put up to being there.\rNow, first, the acting was fantastic. The main character really did his job pretty well, but not only him, but everyone in the movie had an incredible performance. The film is beautifully shot, has some nice special effects when necessary, and it actually is very realistic in many aspects. Though, some scenes that were supposed to be really fascinating were actually slow. The reason of this is the fact that in some parts, this movie lacks of a very good soundtrack. I didn\u2019t really like this, but it doesn\u2019t happen for a very big part of the entire runtime.\rAngelina Jolie didn\u2019t disappoint me, she really showed that she is director material and I hope she keeps directing movies like this one.

Although that being said the length didn't bother me as I thought you needed the full amount of time to tell the story and do true life justice.  For me we we all know stories of incredible human endurance, but this one will rank up there in the top of your mind.  To know actual events like this took place throughout the course of history blows ones mind.  If you haven't seen this one I would recommend setting aside an evening and taking in this historic and epic movie.  For me it hit on all cylinders, being well written, acted, and directed, as I had heard Ms. Angelina Jolie had done her homework and it shows in the movie!"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This is a great movie.

The film made me feel proud that I can walk free in a country with so many great Americans.  I purchased the DVD and I also enjoyed watching the clip about Louie's life and his interview.   I will be buying a copy of the DVD for all of my family."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "It's a story of survival. Survival thorugh the worst of the worst. Yes, it's slow-paced, and no, there aren't a lot of key events that happen in this movie, and no, there isn't really any action in it. It's based on a true story and the story feels accurately portrayed, or ralistic, not to say that I know the differences between it and the movie based on it.

Really great movie, stunning cast."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "While a worthy stand alone movie, because we know the book and this man's life story, we also know that the movie, by focusing primarily on survival in a life raft and survival as a POW, misses what \"Unbroken\" was about.  It is a story of strength and weakness of character, of the people who influence our lives, of falling and redemption and falling and redemption.\r After surviving the war, Louie begins on a path of drunken ruin when he chances upon a revival tent where Billy Graham, a legendary preacher, is giving a sermon.  This sermon starts his recovery from the war and alcoholism and culminates with Louie's trip to Japan to forgive his guards.  The \"Bird\" refuses to see him.  That is the end of the movie, Louie's personal growth to become a better person and the \"Bird\" being trapped in the bitterness of what his life became.\r I don't know anything about Billy Graham and can only imagine how powerfully that scene could have been filmed.  What cinematic potential!  Then watching Louie transform into the man he was to become culminating in the trip to Japan.  I am still mourning the loss.  What a wasted opportunity.\r I would truly like to understand why Angelina Jolie or why the studio committee didn't take this on.  Were they afraid of appearing to promote religion?  Did they think it would scare away movie viewers?  Were they afraid of what others in their community would say about them?  Who fought to make this movie properly and who caved in?\r Any attempt to say the movie would have been too long is a canard.  The time on the raft and scenes in the POW camp were excessive, many not adding to the story.  The ending was fabricated to add drama.  It's almost like the decision to end the film with the war's end was made later rather than upfront and they had to puff it up to get to a reasonable run time.\r Personally in my opinion had they not chickened out, the film would have at a minimum qualified for a Best Picture nomination.  How many times in a lifetime do opportunities like this come along?"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Shows what the deep hearted love of a family and a physically healthy body can endure so that the mind doesn't snap. Zamperini's heart and body pulled him through and shut out his mind from the incredible daily pain. That comes across in this movie very strongly, he says as much when they first get on the dinghy.

It's important to feel the desperation and suffering in a movie like this, but director Angelina Jolie has taken it to painful extremes, presenting scene after scene of mistreatment.

Is there violence...yes but no where NEAR what we see in the likes of other movies. If you've seen Saving Private Ryan you can see this as it doesn't even come remotely close to that. Most of the violent nature is insinuated and not really show (i.e. they will show The Bird swinging a cane but won't actually show him making contact). This movie is a must see for the story of it. Surviving 40+ days at sea followed by years of abuse in a POW camp is unthinkable to me and just makes one realize exactly how amazing the soldiers of the great world wars were!

I have been reading the novel of Unbroken (Louie Zamperini's story) but to be honest the story kinda bored me a little bit but it is has it's entertaining moments.

I definitely would see this movie easily being 3 or even 4 hours long if they focused more on his life out of the war, when he was growing up to build some sort of background and extra feelings for the protagonist, and really feel sorry for him and his family when he went MIA.
