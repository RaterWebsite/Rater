      "text": "I really didn't know what to expect from The Happytime Murders, and that's why I went to see it. I wasn't sure if I'd be getting Team America or Roger Rabbit, maybe even a combination of the two. Despite the tagline, that the film wasn't suitable for children, I did expect some level of juvenile humor, but I thought if it has a edge to it and if the mystery is somewhat compelling, maybe it would surprise me, it didn't. Much in the same way that Roger Rabbit had humans and toons living together, with an extreme bias against toons, this world has humans and puppets living together, with a bias against puppets. Phil Phillips (Ryan Tran) claim to fame was as the first puppet to be a police officer, but now he's washed up, and it's brother's fame and his TV show, The Happytime Family, that overshadows him. Phil doesn't care about anything anymore until someone starts killing off the Happytime gang, including his brother, that's when he wants back in, even if his human partner, Connie Edwards (Melissa McCarthy) wants nothing to do with him anymore. The tagline said this film was not intended for kids, but I disagree, because that's exactly who this film is intended for. The comedy is nothing but sex and jokes aimed at a very young crowd. There is no way that adults are going to find most of the comedy in this film even remotely funny. As for the \"dramatic\" side of the story, the mystery isn't such a mystery, it's so simplistic that you'll know before the first murder even happens. But what about the star of the film, Melissa McCarthy? Well, she plays the same role in just about every film doesn't she? Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, here she just adds to the futility of everything. The bottom line on The Happytime murders is that the story is too basic, the backstory is a complete rip off of Roger Rabbit, and the jokes are so low-brow, that I think even Trey Parker and Matt Stone would pass on using them in a similar film. The true joke here is that this film was ever made."

Quality and dedication to the actual puppetry; Convincing and developed story-line and characters; It was actually funny to the point where lie-actors could have done the lines (the puppetry was there to make it even funnier). 'Happytime Murders' misses on all three levels. You get generic and completely amateur-time puppets both in look and delivery. A carbon-copy of the Roger Rabbit movie, and just brief setups for quick and stand-alone jokes or situations which kinda miss or get tiring halfway through the movie. If you only see the first 20 minutes you'd walk-away somewhat entertained."

It takes place in a world where puppets and humans coexist, but the stuffed creatures are largely scorned. When the cast of a popular TV show starts being killed, a washed-up puppet detective and his old partner (Melissa McCarthy) team up to solve the case. The selling point (and potential source of much raunchy humor) is the streetwise, foul-mouthed, even X-rated approach to puppets.

      "text": "Yes, The Happytime Murders isn't the first raunchy puppet movie (Meet the Feebles) or even the first story to treat puppets as second-class citizens (the short-lived show Greg the Bunny). But it is hilarious, I laughed a lot.The film has a lot creatively insane jokes. Yet, despite the craziness, the film does have a decent plot to it. Though, admittedly it does have a lot of detective/noir cliches to it.The human cast is surprisingly good in this considering that they have to act with puppets most of the time. Melissa McCarthy, Elizabeth Banks, and Maya Rudolph all put in some of their better performances. In fact, I think this is the best I've seen Maya, who plays a goofy secretary. Credit should be given to veteran Muppet performer Bill Barretta (Pepe the Prawn) as the main character. He pulls off the unenviable job of making the main puppet character Phil come off as tough and gritty, albeit in a humorous way. Only downside to the acting in this is that the puppets' voices are performed by veteran puppeteers rather than cast outside voices and there are a couple of times where the puppeteers' voices weren't strong enough to fit the tone.Lastly, I really have to admire the technical effort put into this. A lot of effort is made to populate this world with multiple puppets, even if they're just in the background. It really sells the idea of a world populated with them. I haven't seen a puppet film that has had this many full-torso shots. If you don't like comedy that pushes the edge or is weird, this isn't for you. But I really recommend this if you like this sort of thing but aren't completely sold."

The story is your basic murder mystery with out any real surprises. It relies on shock humor to get laughs but after a while it gets old and lame. It tries be adult by using crude jokes and sexual imagery but unfortunately it comes off as childish. The characters are are boring and uninteresting. The protagonist is a complete ass while the supporting characters are all idiots who's sole purpose is to make the protagonist look smarter. The only one who is at all interesting is Bubbles played by Maya Rudolph. She is the protagonist's secretary and has more personalty than all the other characters combined. In conclusion unless you have nothing better to do stay away from this film."

I don\u2019t mind crude humor. I enjoyed sausage party to a degree. South Park has its time and place. This is just a different beast though. Three or four scenes I can think of specifically that are almost scarring. I hate to make it seem like this, but it does seem like you respect it for the puppeteering part or this stuff cracks you up. It does not do the latter for me. I get that some of the puppeteering is cool, I know that there is more than one person working on the puppet and that takes some of the fun away for me."

I could never give a movie a low score if I was smiling through out and laughed at loud at several scenes, many of which where not in any trailer.  So in summary, don't go to this movie if you think you will get something on the caliber of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, because you won't but if you enjoyed Sausage Party I don't see why you couldn't enjoy this too.  I for one had a great time and so did my Sister (who I took to the movie since she was visiting in town)"

To me I haven\u2019t laughed for alongtime at many new films most of the way through in the last 5-10 years, it\u2019s very subtle, twisted and beyond the obvious humour is very poignant. With its adult stars(it maybe twisted but is not porn) I usually cannot stand Melissa McCarthy and her other SNL alumni (was not a fan of Bridemaids and so forth) but she suited this down to the ground juxtapose to the other 2D characters. Maya Rudolph\u2019s character Bubbles was fun and represented the muppets in a human form of being kind, happy go lucky which was so different to her boss Phil Phillips who I saw as equally dejected, depressed, depraved, dark and twisted in humour too but with pride. It is lazy to compare it to Ted or Team America-they are totally different and in some cases too extreme Sauage Party went wayward and which can be an issue with South Park and Family Guy episodes and to be honest Ted 2 sucked and should not have been made (not Seth Mcfarlane\u2019s finest hour, though The Orville series amended that).  Happytime Murders toes the line correctly and I congratulate Brian Henson on this as he must struggle being in his Dads shadow and perhaps he has wanted to do a film like this for a long time but been advised against it. After the film I would like this to be a great tv series or a similar idea for Netflix which I would happily watch.  Now sorry to bust the moaning critics bubble but I grew up with the muppets during the 80s and seen all the films including the known ones in the 90s but the newer ones in the last few years were lame and the last series was trying to be like the office which was boring.  This film is an adult film quite clearly that uses Muppet like characters-similar to the humour in Avenue Q and is not for kids and it could be seen as a less raucous Ralph Bakshi film in parts.   The film develops well and you can see it being obvious in places but that\u2019s part of the joke, it\u2019s tongue in cheek, irony and get this it\u2019s a comedy not a deep film and for an hour and half it will are you smile. I think in the U.K. it will fare better as British people have a darker sense of humour and get the nuances of noir. If you want something deep then go watch a French arty film about a painter/ballerina or some socio-political film you can analyse with your yuppie/artsy friends.  However if you are intrigued to go see this, please do and escape the mundane existence of most movies which are so CGI heavy or lacking in plot."

      "text": "A one-joke comedy centered around the concept of watching puppets be vulgar and raunchy. The far less clever Ted did the same thing just with teddy bears, yet it was somehow given a pass. Meanwhile this movie has an actual plot.The whole thing is also meant to be an allegory for racism, but fails at being effective social commentary. This is because it's never clearly defined how the racism in its world works. You'll see things like a depiction of a more subtle, quiet bigotry and a mutual sense of disdain or mistrust that's been formed by years of prior abuse that closely mirrors today's social climate, only to then witness segregated hospitals and characters making blatantly racist remarks that no one calls them out for like we're back in the late 1800s, early 1900s or something. Essentially, it struggles to pick between two different time periods it wants to critique, one of which is wildly outdated, and therefore fails to offer anything on the topic other than a generic \"mmmm, racism bad 'kay?\" message. I hate to say it, but I think even Bright did much better job on this front.For all of its faults though which relate to things like the simplistic story and some aspects that just flat out don't work, I was surprised by just how much this made me laugh. It's all a bunch of nasty sex and potty shock humor, but there's something about that which actually kind of works under the whole \"Muppets for adults\" conceit because of how effectively it catches you off guard with how far it's willing to go at times. Plus, there are some genuinely amusing flourishes that come from just how well realized these puppets are not just as characters, but anatomically as well. So as stupid and gross as it may be I still walked away entertained and wouldn't mind seeing another project along the same lines."

The overall plot itself was an uninspiring police procedural so all the stereotypes make their appearance. The guy who played \"Stanley\" in the \"The Office\" series has a minor role here, so that was mildly interesting, but mostly it was a chore to watch this since it was so formulaic, even given all the muppet sex/violence.
