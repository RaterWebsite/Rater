This movie is so woke that it makes stupid \"Orange Man Bad\" jokes 6 or 7 months after the man got booted from office.  Kinda makes me laugh because your adding real elements into a fictional universe when the only people who are \"purging\" right now are the far left.  This film is recommended for those who think that Lovecraft Country or the HBO Watchmen series are good continuations of the works of the original authors HP Lovecraft or Alan Moore.  It is also recommended for woketards and for communists who are so preoccupied with labeling people with acronyms that they've used atleast a 3rd of the alphabet to come up with a grievance group. (example: lgbtqia+abcdefg)"

But The Forever Purge is entertaining enough, and sets up its interesting premise well enough, for these problems not to bog down the film to much. It should be stated though, this film is very, very political. If you lean more to the right, you may not like The Forever Purge as much. I'd give it a watch if you have some cash to burn and want to be entertained for 90 minutes. General audiences will most likely enjoy it."

Did you want to watch a movie that tells you you're a racist if you love your country and refuse to allow millions of immigrants across the border unchecked? This is the one for you. On top of that it has all the woke check marks. Girls doing it for themselves, Anti-Americanism. Socialism. And real life Nazis with swastika face tattoos!! Do not watch this movie if you have an IQ over 20. All of this is on CNN."

      "text": "The new installation in The Purge series ventures outside an urban setting and beyond a 24-hour window of violent mayhem. For those who don\u2019t know, The Purge is one evening when all acts of violence are legal, supposedly to allow our nation to vent its frustrations. In this version, a group of Texas vigilantes determined to rid the US of all immigrants, decides to continue the bloodshed after the deadline. The plot follows an American family and some Mexican immigrants who must band together to stay alive. The expected scenes of brutality are sprinkled throughout, but lack much originality or shock. There\u2019s too much time making statements about immigration and our nation\u2019s periolous politics, which dilutes the movie\u2019s impact."

      "text": "Forever Purge was a great movie spoke a lot on topics that are happening in our nation. The story was great, The kills were trash ;The purge has a play book and it\u2019s all Gun shoots. A night where people can legally kill people you know someone is gonna pull some Jigsaw Trap nonsense. The movie compared to the other Purge\u2019s this is a 10/10. The movie was well shot and the ending was great, showing that the Purge and NFFA destroyed themselves by not listening to their people and country. I sincerely hope that they don\u2019t make another purge as this is the perfect ending for the Purge Series. The Country caused its own down fall. Simple and Poetic. Spoke alot on Poor and Rich classes which was Interesting to see how the Classes are effected during a night of Legalized Crime. Also, nice to see how Racist spend the night of the purge and then seeing said Racist get their Brain Splattered. The Forever Purge needs to be the Final Purge. They need to work on making More interesting kills for this Series. Give the Audience a sense of true Crime and how horrible Humans can be Movie gets a 7/10 Out of all the Purge Moive\u2019s it\u2019s a 10/10"

The story wasn't new, the concept was copied from The Purge series: Season 2 but execution was in the way thay you will enjoy it.Was the movie perfect? No. It had its problems but it didn't deserved so much negativity. Only giving negative reviews because movie was almost same story and policies is wrong. This franchise is meant for fun and they did bring something new.Overall, I would recommend anyone to watch this movie, especially to those who love or have watched this franchise's other movies."

It's a step up from The First Purge, and while that isn't saying much, the writing is sharp enough to not come across as just plain offensive. The political/race/classism themes the franchise has going are dialed up to 20 here, and while there are a few viscerally eerie scenes, they still don't hit the mark perfectly. A good, not great Purge film that ranks somewhere behind the first two."

The saga invented by DeMonaco barely touches on such historical legacy and consequently its political criticism is nothing short of feeble. The same should be remarked of the shift from the \"home invasion\" to the xenophobic isolationism of this 5th chapter, useful just to show the stereotypes and the skill of make-up artists and stuntmen."

Now, since THE FIRST PURGE, it's basically the same boring experience. The only nice thing about this was the purge being extended after the twelve hours. Still, wasn't able to carry the movie into a great spot -  most characters were expressionles. Sad to see a great horror franchise going donwhill, especially on the last movie."

Ok before I go negative crazy I do want to say there are positives to the movie like the actors they did a good job, I thought the movie was well shot and some action scenes looked good. Now I just have to say that this movie didn\u2019t really need to exist, Election Year left off on a great note the cancellation of the Purge but from the very start they Purge is suddenly back, first off where did Leo Barns go. This is a sequel to Election Year where it ended with Charlie Roan won the presidential election and she ended the Purge so what happened to her, never explained. But that\u2019s besides the point I just don\u2019t really like it, one big reason is the lack of violence, there is no blood at all. Well barely the others for as much CG blood they use it\u2019s still blood, this movie barely has any except for a few moments. Speaking of shotty CGI the explosions look straight out of a PS2 game. One in particular looked AWFUL, but the ending is so bad I don\u2019t know what to feel because the last 45 minutes have the main characters have to cross the Mexico border to escape the US but at the end it says \u201cEveryday Americans are picking up guns and killing the Purgers\u201d WHY. Overall this movie has some highs but has very low lows. Ranking. Ok. Yes that the rank it\u2019s like the first Resident Evil movie if nothing else is on sure I\u2019ll watch it."
