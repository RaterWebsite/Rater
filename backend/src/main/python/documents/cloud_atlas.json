Each story is intelligently edited and narrated, as common themes and plot progressions flow into one another. The acting, makeup and imagery are also excellent. This is a movie about love, institution, freedom, power and the amazing simplicity of the human nature. I do believe this philosophical dreadnought could not be steered by any other than the Wachowskis, and is most aptly described by many viewers as ambitious for its scope and diversity. As one of the characters describes, \"A half-finished book is a half-finished love affair\", I would, too, feel truly incomplete if the stories met no conclusion and were stopped short. I am not disappointed in the book-movie incongruities, as these two items establish themselves with different goals and visions of the same plane. While I understand this type of movie is not everyone's cup of tea, you will most definitely leave the movie theater acknowledging that it was a few dollars well-spent."

Colourful, rich, vibrant, affecting all emotional responses. A rare standout movie in a time of shallow plagiarism. Six stories entwined in one, offering sci-fi / love / suspense / action / drama / thriller. Conceptually majestic, daring production, quality performances and captivating stories provide an exquisite palate."

Hell, I didn't even think I would hit the 3 hour mark but I wanted something to watch while playing video games.  40 minutes in, and the storyline just felt confusing...but then, at the hour and a half mark, everything began to come together and this curious film started to take on a disordered order, and I found myself completely disinterested in my game and staring intently as the plot became to take shape and form before my very eyes.  I am a critical person of works, and I usually am quickly annoyed by small flaws but this movie didn't feel like a movie....it felt like 5 movies playing at once, all interconnected in different and strange details.\r Now, I absolutely know that this isn't a movie for everyone.  I didn't think much of the movie at all until an hour into the movie and I understand that for most people that's usually unacceptable.  I get that people also just want something entertaining because I myself was looking for a cheap movie to casually watch.  However, if you do want a good, interesting movie that goes against the grain, and if you don't mind the long time that the movie takes to setup it's plot, it's a very cool and interesting movie which as a result of it's design poses some very interesting and relevant questions to the viewer.  Perhaps not everyone will find it posed as a question or summation like I did, but nonetheless the movie is wholly different from the standard cookie-cutter films you see pumped out."

Is it another self indulgent effort from the Watchowski Siblings, or a Masterpiece?  Based on what is considered as an unfilmable novel, Cloud Atlas starts of as a project of such high risk, that the Watchowskis have difficulties finding the right investors.  Why not? It is an Art Film with a Blockbuster budget. At its heart though, it is one of the more contemplative film that they have made since the Matrix, using every trick in the book a film that pushes the envelope so far, that it flops miserably.  Only time will tell whether it joins the pantheon of 'visionary', 'much beyond its time' film making such as 'Blade Runner'.  The question is will anyone give the Watchowskis', one of the most daring visionary film makers of their generation, another set of budgets after two flops in succession?"

The only people who would say it is \"cheesy\" or \"cliche'\" are the most jaded of us. It's cliche' because it's true. It's a vulnerable message that Cloud Atlas tries to bring home, and I think it is a message that is disturbing to the American mainstream mindset. Cloud Atlas wants you to know that you aren't safe from other people... for better and for worse. It succeeds in doing that and it feels satisfying. What drags the film down though is the length and the multiple storylines. I appreciated the purpose they served, but felt I could have done without so many. There were several characters I simply wanted \"more\" of, but didn't really get. It left me wanting more development for individual stories, but then again, maybe that's just another way Cloud Atlas drives home its central message.  It's a good movie. See it with someone you care about."

The film is ambiguous but in a way that allows for you to really think about what you watched and not in an infuriating way.

I would have loved giving my money to see this in theaters. The film is like 2 hours and a half long and I never got bored, in fact, without even noticing it, I was more and more into it as the film progressed. By the last hour I was absolutely surprised at how much I was loving the experience. Only bad thing I can say is some of the make-up doesn\u00b4t look good, but even that was probably done on purpose. Each one of the stories adds something different and are totally enjoyable. I felt like the futuristic ones could have been a film on its own, with great and innovative special effects. The film is truly memorable, I plan on watching it several times in the future. My favorite story was the boy who was a musical genius, that was the one with more heart and with the best acting in my opinion. But really, all the actors are on point, and it\u00b4s absolutely incredible to think how they even managed to put all this together and make it work. Outstanding body of work, emotive, epic, funny, sad and everything in between. What an experience. One of those very few cases when I strongly disagree with the critics rating. But time puts things in its place, and I\u00b4ve already seen several of them taking back their negative opinions. Memorable."

      "text": "Cloud Atlas is a hot mess. There is about half a good movie here. The themes presented are relevant: love, dignity, freedom. Unfortunately they are sometimes presented in such a way as to seem trite or even cliched. There are also some strange and baffling elements that just don't work.\r I'm also going to get this out of the way right now: I was not a fan of the use of yellowface and whiteface on non-Asian and non-Caucasian actors, but not for the politically correct reasons a lot of people were. I didn't feel that the characterizations were racist or offensive. My main problem was that with a few exceptions, it looked really unconvincing.\r Of the six stories, I was most fond of the tale of Sonmi-451 (Neo Seoul, 2144). Her story was dark and tragic yet hopeful at the same time. The world she inhabits is a glitzy dystopia built upon the worst excesses of contemporary corporate culture. Of all the sequences, this one and the story of Robert Frobisher (Cambridge and Edinburgh, 1936) would have made enjoyable full-length films in their own right.\r I liked the sequence set in the UK, 2012, starring Jim Broadbent as Timothy Cavendish in what was essentially a dark comedy vignette about an aging publisher and his gangster client (Tom Hanks). Even a throwaway joke about soylent green being people actually relates to a disturbing element in the Neo Seoul sequence.\r The story set in the South Pacific in 1849 about a young lawyer who falls sick during a voyage and is under the care of a doctor who it emerges is poisoning him in order to steal his belongings but is saved by a runaway slave fell flat. Tom Hanks as Doctor Goose had a false nose and prosthetic buck teeth which made him look like a character from League of Gentlemen (the British comedy series, not the crappy adaptation of a good Alan Moore comic book). Predictably the lawyer, who is helping the slave by hiding him and then later gets him work as a sailor on the ship, become friends. When the lawyer returns home he declares to his slave-owning father-in-law that he and his wife will go east to aid with the abolition efforts. It should be powerful but it just feels cliched and somewhat cheesy.\r I don't have too much to say about the sequence in which Halle Berry plays the main role. It was neither good nor bad and felt like an homage to movies of the era in which it was set, namely the early 1970s, featuring a tough, independent black journalist whistle-blower uncovering a conspiracy at a nuclear power plant run by an unscrupulous business man. Taken on its own, it could have made a rather average thriller with a few good moments of tension.\r The sequence set on a post-apocalyptic Hawaii in the year 2321, just stank. It reminded me of Battlefield Earth, but with better production values and no use of dutch angles that I can remember. Tom Hanks plays a superstitious coward belonging to a tribe of people with vaguely Maori-like tattoos on their faces. He is plagued by hallucinations of Hugo Weaving as a character that can best be described as a goblin with a top hat, who I think is supposed to represent his fear and religious hang-ups. Tom Hanks' people live in constant fear of cannibals on horseback with fearsome facepaint. Halle Berry plays a character from some nice,shiny utopia where they have pretty, shiny vehicles and fusion power. She's on the island looking for some ancient secret which she tells Tom Hanks is \"The true true.\" or some such childish baby-talk. It's all very confusing and stupid and ends with Tom Hanks and Halle Berry living happily ever after on some distant planet with two dozen grandchildren sitting around a campfire listening to Grampy Tom Hanks tell stories.\r I haven't read the book, so I can't really compare it the source material. The principal cast appears throughout the movie in multiple roles because they're reincarnations of characters from earlier time periods, but it's not presented in chronological order. Some of it is intriguing. Some of it is hard to care about. Other parts are just plain weird and not always in a good or compelling way."

It took three film crews across the world, three writers/directors to adapt a screenplay from a book that was deemed impossible to do. I don't care much for parts of the story, but the themes, editing, humour, suspense, and eye popping makeup design and special effects are sure to please any viewer. I've never seen anything like it, nor will there ever be."

      "text": "\"Cloud Atlas\" 10 Scale Rating: 9.0 (Amazing) ...\r The Good: An absolutely epic film with several fantastic stories all rolled into one. If you can make it through the lengthy run time, you'll be rewarded. Extremely ambitious and risky attempt, which has garnered a polarized response, but an attempt worthy of respect. Severely underrated.\r The Bad: You feel every minute of the 2:52 run time, especially early on. I was not impressed initially as the early stages of the film are difficult to get through. Hit and miss makeup takes away from the film as well. Some of the makeup jobs are extremely silly to look at and distracting."

I then read the book, watched to movie again, and only after seeing it twice and reading the book did I come to fully understand the impressive magnitude of this movie.  This is one of the most under-appreciated films in recent history as most people dismiss it as boring and uninteresting.  Watch it once and you will want to watch it again and again.  It has amazing cinematography, terrific music, and great acting overall in an amazing story that stays true to the amazing book it is based off of."

      "text": "Overall the story is intriguing, it's just that due to there being multiple interwoven stories taking place in vastly different settings and time periods, not all parts of the movie appealed to me. It jumps from satirical comedy to some grimdark dystopia to spy movie to drama, which can be jarring. Still, when the story comes full circle it feels pretty rewarding, but the movie certainly isn't for everyone as there is a lot of stuff going on and the pacing is generally slow."

      "text": "I originally went to watch this movie in the theatres because the name caught my attention and the reviews were so divided.\r In my experience, when opinions are split like in the case of Cloud Atlas, with some saying that it was a fabulous movie, and others that it wasn't.. with many quoting that they didn't UNDERSTAND what they watched, it's something worth watching.\r As far as I'm concerned, I was right. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.\r I have nothing negative to say about it, other than that it was sometimes mentally draining to try and keep up with all the themes that I saw, to try and confirm any connections between events in the various stories, yet that too was all part of the fun.\r Not only was the acting excellent, the overall story welded itself together in such a remarkably vague yet visible way that, as a viewer, I couldn't help but come up with underlying themes and theories all on my own.\r Everlasting love, transcendence of time, strength of human connections and will, the concept of freedom.. just to name a few.\r Now, let's be clear. This movie isn't for everyone, and definitely not intended for young children.\rUncomfortable with sex scenes? Can't follow not-shallow plot? Wrong movie.\r On the other hand, if one is looking for a unique movie where the story's main messages aren't bluntly shoved in your face, but suggested at and left for the viewer to discern in wild, yet smooth, dynamic fashion, this is definitely worth a watch or two (or more).\r All things considered, I highly recommend Cloud Atlas for any appropriate viewers."

I'm not sure the movie really gets it done, but the interplay of the different stories helps portray the universal aspects of human nature and how the struggle continues throughout time and place."

      "text": "One of the most criminally underrated movies to date and the best work of the Wachowski's hands down.The ambition and scale of Cloud Atlas is one of a kind with 6 different stories over a timeframe of many centuries. Each story is great on its own with a unqiue tone and style but it goes further. All of these stories are connected to form one big story and message to the viewer.I can only assume that a lot of the more middling or negative reviews come from the initially confusing plot of the movie and the fact that actors play several roles at once with the help of makeup and prosthetics. It can certainly be hard to wrap your head around at first but there is a method to the madness.Even if it may require a second viewing you start to understand how the different stories feed into each other and ultimately all tell the same story of oppression throughout history and how the actors play iterations of the same character throughout all of these 6 storylines.It's a shame how overlooked this movie was back in the day because it's truly one of a kind with a unique style, great ambition and a great message."

      "text": "This film addresses a subject rarely addressed in the cinema: how individual actions can, over the time, influence the course of future events. It mixes six different stories passed in the past, present and future. It's directed by Tom Tykwer, who also wrote the script along with Lana and Lilly Wachowski. In his several roles, it includes Tom Hanks, Jim Broadbent, Jim Sturgess, Ben Whishaw, Halle Berry and Doona Bae, among other artists.This movie is one of the most complex and difficult to follow I've seen in cinema. We need to view it carefully in order to understand it and savor it, and that complexity is a motive why some people will probably dislike it. By mixing six stories situated in six moments in space and time, but united by so subtle connection elements such as a song, a book or a birthmark, this film looks like a tangle of stories without head or tail, but it's not true. That happens because the topic addressed is also complex, so as David Mitchell's novel. The script is flawless, superb and deserves congratulations but the cast deserves even more applause. They literally had to unfold to make this film and none of the main actors made less than three different characters, which is an achievement and a challenge for any actor. And perhaps it was the pleasure of the challenge that led so many big names from Hollywood to risk entering in an openly indie film, far from the financial support of the big corporations of the industry. The technical offices are beyond reproach, thought of every detail and made an exceptional work: the costumes are exquisite and the makeup and visual and special effects are gradually surprising more and more. Reinhold Heil signs the soundtrack, which was also excellent.There are certain films that, as good as can be, end up being marginalized due to issues that have nothing to do with the quality or beauty. This film is one of those. Despite the depth and complexity of the script doesn't allow it to be massively understood or appreciated, is an exceptionally good movie that the fact of not having a film company behind left almost out of the critics attention or the major industry awards. Surprising, exciting, this film is mentally provocative and it's sad that hasn't even been nominated for more categories at the Oscars and Golden Globes."

      "text": "Cloud Atlas is a true missundestood masterpiece. It touches on the deepest subjects such as love, rebellion, life, death, indecision and so much more. Each part of it is brilliantly crafted and put all together in one true flawless masterpiece. The level of mediocrity humanity has reached is unbelievable. Even bumblebee.....bumblebee has a better metacritic than this dramatic and sad yet funny masterpiece. There was one line in birdman that said all the critics do is say big words instead of analyzing the structure and everything important in that movie. The only thing they do is tear appart and trash on original movies just because they can't do a movie. They never think how much effort went into a good and original script, the production design, the special effects, cinematography, editing, etc. They just do what they know best (being selfish retarded **** who are not able to percieve nor understand true art) and giving good grades to the newest unoriginal hollywood movies like bumblebee. The critics don't want profound messages about life death, etc. What the #### is that U don't know. They just want explosions, action, shooting, etc, etc, etc! So as a message to everybody: #### the critics. Every lazy incompetent can be a critic, He/She calls a site and asks for a job and then gets payed by that site to trash on every new artistic film and give 9/10 ratings to every new Marvel Audio Visual Product (because obviously marvel movies are not really movies. Movies have a message and artistic values)"
