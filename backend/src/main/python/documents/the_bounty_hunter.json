Then you watch it they have simply no chemistry and the film is so badly written it isn't funny. It isn't bad enough to be good. I give this movie 13%."

The story is predictable and cliched, the dialogue is laughably bad, and not even Jason Sudeikis (great on \"SNL\" and \"30 Rock\") can bring any humor to this."

Can we please get a \"Friends\" movie or something because you are way spending too much money on these Gucci shoes? I really don't like Jennifer Anniston and it's time for her to give it up because \"The Bounty Hunter\" is one of the most absolute drenched-up movies of all time."

      "text": "This is the IDEAL flick for people who are bored of watching Robert De Niro  Charles Grodin's scrotummy old faces every Christmas when Midnight Run is on the telly. That was well overdue a remake and the Hollywood guys have delivered in spades. There's a bit of a twist this time tho. The bounty is on a girl and the bounty hunter is her ex boyfriend. You can understand how awkward it's gonna be when they're cuffed together for the duration of the film. Comedy actors Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston positively sizzle throughout... on-screen and off. That's method acting."

The movie contains just a teeny tiny touch of action for the male and a smidgen of believable romance for the female, although both elements are done poorly. With all the hype of the stars' off-screen romance and the oft-repeated trailer on TV, I was looking forward to this movie. This is my first movie critique -- I was so disappointed I felt it necessary to warn others."

      "text": "Nicole, an investigative journalist lucky enough to still be writing for a newspaper, skips her mandated court appearance so she can work on her story, and becomes a fugitive of the law. Since her crime is barely a misdemeanor, it seems a bit overblown that a bounty hunter would be warranted for such a minor offense. This is a police matter, or a PETA concern, but Milo, a former cop, is given the assignment and rejoices at the opportunity to track down his ex-wife. Going into this film, the moviegoer already knows that the bounty hunter will get his woman in more ways than one. It's the chase, the pursuit of the bounty hunter's former spouse, like a domesticized version of Andrew Davis' \"The Fugitive\" that might have given this film some heat, had Nicole been hard to outfox. She's not; she's too easy to find. \"The Bounty Hunter\" is a comedy all right, but it's the wrong kind: romantic instead of screwball. Even though he incapacitates Nicole by throwing her in a trunk, and she tasers Milo in a motel room(dealbreakers both for most reconciling couples), the old feelings return, as the film jettisons its premise in favor of a routine crime drama, where the bounty hunter becomes \"Her Boy Friday\" instead. There's at least one storyline too many, as this tired film completely loses its footing when Milo stops hunting Nicole, and hunts her bounty instead in tandem. \"The Bounty Hunter\" should have been an all-out war of the sexes: the woman constantly outsmarting the man, like Jane Sibbett in an episode of \"Quantum Leap\", where she's always one step ahead of the sheriff's body that Sam(Scott Bakula) inherits."

      "text": "While the film does not really have anything particularly good about it, it does not have anything particularly bad about it either. Going into the film with the expectation to laugh and be entertained a lot will definitely produce a disappointment. There is, really, barely anything that is funny about the film at all, so that is a let-down.The screenplay is rather messy, with really boring dialogue and a rather confusing and unnecessary mixture of different characters and side-stories that come into it. The acting was.. well, what you'd expect of Aniston and Butler - not very much.Nevertheless, I cannot give this film a straight-out negative grade, just because of the fact that the film did not leave such a strong (or negative) impression on me. Actually, it did not leave any impression on me what-so-ever.It's one of those films that one can watch if you're bored one afternoon and it's on TV. You won't like it, but you won't hate it either."

She was so good in \"The Good Girl\" and respectable in \"Friends with Money\" and \"The Break-Up.\"  Other than that, whoever is picking vehicles to showcase any talent she may have continues to fail...miserably.  I won't even go into Gerard Butler who is immensely overrated and an absolute pathetic actor."

It was almost like a \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" wannabe - and I see the connection, but if you want a troubled marriage combined with action then watch that instead. It was very predictable with a silly storyline that doesn't even try to pretend the couple won't end up together in the end."
