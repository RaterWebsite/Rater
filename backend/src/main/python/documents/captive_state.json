  "description": "Nearly a decade after occupation by an extraterrestrial force, the lives of a Chicago neighborhood on both sides of the conflict are explored. In a working-class Chicago neighborhood occupied by an alien force for nine years, increased surveillance and the restriction of civil rights have given rise to an authoritarian system -- and dissent among the populace.",

Don't go in expecting super-heroes, spectacular explosions, choreographed battles or thrilling chase scenes.This is a thought-provoking story about a dystopian future when humans live under the subjugation of aliens. Think of the French Resistance operating in the shadows of the German occupation during World War II.The movie focuses on the life of a person who is working to escape to the wilderness. He has minor interactions with the rebels in the beginning, but unknowingly becomes an important part of their plan."

Elegantly-told, it feels like 3 slow-moving seasons of USA's \"Colony\" supercharged into a bite-sized two hour chunk.  Love the story, the effects are incredible, and the acting is perfect - not at all over done like so many sci-fi films of its ilk."

      "text": "Usually when a movie is released without much fanfare and a lack of critic reviews, it's a sign of a stinker.    However, despite some negative reviews, \"Captive State\" is anything but a stinker.    We get tired sure of dystopian futuristic societies, and alien movies any more are almost as abundant as super hero movies.    It's admittedly a tempting subject to portray an alien civilization however the studio wants, either ugly and benevolent, cutesy, or pure malevolent evil.    This movie doesn't show too much of the aliens who have made humans on earth their subjects, but it's much more a believable pitch on the order of \"District 9\" as opposed to the insultingly stupid \"Independence Day\" films.    We are made to draw conclusions, only to have them proven wrong.    The pace is riveting and the film centers around two types of the captive world population:    thoroughly ass kissing and pandering, including corrupt law enforcement in Chicago where this story takes place who take their orders from the \"legislators\", aka the hideous aliens, and brave people who are determined to fight back against both the aliens and the humans who choose a fate as captives, involving turncoats and spies everywhere, making the main thrust of the movie, an attack against their captors and people unwilling to rise up to regain their planet back.    John Goodman is a great actor - totally believable and an ultimately sympathetic character.    If there is one minor gripe, it's the short role by Vera Farmiga, one of the best actresses out there.    Her talent is not utilized to its potential, but even the small role she plays is a critical one.    Most of any possible plot loopholes are closed up in the final part of the movie, and the dramatic feel is top notch for a movie of this genre.    Those panning \"Captive State\" are frankly, unfair.    The pace doesn't allow for the massive \"character development\" they ask for.    Then again, none is really needed that doesn't already present itself.    The film is articulate, dynamic and nothing of the confusing or disappointing descriptions some reviewers have determined it to be.    Just pay close attention."

      "text": "Excellent, tense sci-fi thriller. The best sci-fi, IMO, is allegorical as Captive State certainly is. The alien invasion could just as well be, say, the Nazis occupying Poland, but the suspense is enhanced by the mysteriousness of the aliens -- the unknown is always more frightening. The tension starts within minutes of the movie's beginning, and it slowly escalates over the next 1.5 hours till a climactic scene (which I won't divulge); things subsequently calm down in what seems a sort of epilogue... until there's a surprise (which I won't divulge :-) ). The direction style felt a lot like District 9.I understand some of the criticism about character development, but it's not really a character-driven story. It's about the human desire for freedom and the lengths to which some people will go to obtain that freedom. It's conceptually similar to the tv series Colony: people make choices about the kind of life they want to live and whether it's worth giving up that life for a greater good. It's certainly not surprising to know that some people will always choose to fight for freedom, and we go into Captive State knowing this, but we can still enjoy the ride.The movie doesn't spell everything out for you, which I appreciate, but some might find it frustrating at certain moments where you have to fill in the blanks. It's an intelligent thriller with excellent performances (wish Vera Farmiga were featured more) and an ending which most will find satisfying."

      "text": "Instead of an aliens attack, this film takes place 9 years after they've taken control of Earth. Their presence is largely unseen, but they exert a demanding power over humans. Naturally, a group of rebels plots to destroy them. Anyone expecting lots of cool sci-fi stuff will be massively disappointed. There are a few glimpses, but it's mostly a paranoid drama with lots of ominous threats and little payoff. The filmmakers have also chosen to keep us in the dark: Literally, a lot of scenes are in shadow that don't reveal much of the creatures and figuratively, it's often confusing to figure out what's happening. A plodding, dull disappointment"

      "text": "Captive State is one of the biggest disappointment for me in 2019 so far. The trailer hooked me completely: an image of a stadium singing the Star Spangled banner while an ominous shadow, presumably a spaceship, laying across it.  What you have instead is a pedestrian flick that is reminiscent of any 'police state' type of film or heck..even TV series as a matter of fact. The era of 'peak TV' as we know it now has created series with the production values of 'middle range movies': be it 'The Handmaid's Tale', 'A Man from High Castle' among the meaty offering available today.  Captive State took a similar route but in a completely rushed way: a certain world building is rushed in the first 10 minutes.  Characters are unappealing and just being skimmed through.  The titular aliens? Well, for a race that was so advanced, they actually behaved like the xenomorphs from the Alien series. They are designed to give you a jump scare.  As it is, this is a poor attempt in modernizing a more superior series: 'V', with a seemingly 'menacing / benevolent' alien race taking over the world and instilling a 'Nazi' like state.  If it was made as a TV series in a streaming service, it would have been passable.  As a movie however, a completely forgettable experience."

      "text": "I'm with the Variety review rated 90.  I'm also with the reviews who say it's a mess and very likely was a nightmare to edit.  Still, John Goodman holds the thing together masterfully.  The title is useless.  The real title is Endgame, where one game is played and then the endgame reveals itself.  This pays off handsomely in the third act.  Up to then tho too hard to identify with anyone.  What I suspect is this movie was not story boarded nor pre-vized end to end.  If it had been, the messiness would have been greatly reduced.  It's problems are not lack of talent or good ideas.  It's problems are messy cinematic storytelling.  I also do honor this director's Planet of the Apes contribution."

The story is expertly crafted, with twists and turns that keep the audience on the edge of their seats. The film's atmosphere is palpable, with the gritty and oppressive nature of the alien-controlled Chicago adding to the tension and making the audience feel as though they are right there in the middle of the action. The performances from the cast, particularly John Goodman and Ashton Sanders, are fantastic, adding depth and complexity to their characters. The film also does a great job of creating a believable and terrifying alien threat. Special effects are used sparingly, but to great effect, making the aliens feel like a real and looming presence throughout the film.Captive State is a film that should not be missed. It's a masterful blend of science fiction, action, and political commentary, that will leave audiences thinking long after the credits have rolled. It's a film that will resonate with audiences, and one that will be remembered as a classic in the genre."
