      "text": "Downsizing takes an interesting premise and turns it into one of the most boring, plodding blunders I have ever seen. The pacing of this movie is all over the place. Some scenes fly by so quickly you cannot understand what is happening, and others go by so slowly that you wonder when the movie will end. The movie is very liberal with scenes accompanied by music in which nothing happens. In an attempt to be artsy, these scenes come off as nothing more than poorly disguised attempts to pad the run time.The script is hit-or-miss at best and asinine at worst. Matt Damon does his best to give an honest performance, and he and Christoph Waltz are the only watchable parts of the movie. Downsizing is just a giant let down."

      "text": "Unfortunately from a promising start this film devolved into a dull homily on \"helping people is what matters\".  I could see so many promising avenues this could have explored based on the premise of shrinking people to lessen their impact on the environment, and it touches very lightly on a few of them (for example the inherent conflicts between the \"smalls\" and the \"normals\", the notion that repressive governments would use the technology in repressive ways, the problems of borders dealing with humans who come in pint size, the obvious issue that even in Leisure Land somebody needs to clean the toilets), but then it wastes time in a drug-induced trance, and loses its way entirely by meandering off into the original small colony in Norway reacting to a potential doomsday scenario that makes absolutely no sense (it does make sense to plan for it in the long run, but there's no reason at all for the darn hurry).  Matt Damon is the most boring protagonist I can ever remember him being in any of his films, and even the always impressive Christoph Waltz and the bright newcomer Hong Chau couldn't pull the unfocused script back from the brink.  I did like how Matt Damon's character came full circle (from taking care of his ailing mother at the start), that's a neat thematic viewpoint, but I really wanted this film to do a lot more with its premise and the big ideas that came with that.  Heck, even just more of the interaction between tiny humans and the regular-sized world would have been more interesting, though that was the most superficial if funny aspect of the film.  As usual, science fiction remains best left to actual science fiction writers."

      "text": "The most notable thing about Downsizing was I laughed a lot more than I ever expected to. I'm not about to urge you all to rush out and see this one. For one thing the trailer painted a slightly different picture than the one you end up getting. Not only that but there are a number of scenes that don't appear in the film at all. When a trailer about a topic as weird as this features a scene involving people 5 inches tall drinking out of a massive bottle of vodka and then doesn't appear in the film you can't help but notice that. It's not the best movie you'll see all year but it's so quirky and out there that you'll enjoy it in the moment and might even get some laughs out of it, I know I did.In a world where overpopulation is an issue the only feasible solution apparently is to undergo a permanent procedure called downsizing. This will greatly benefit the environment etc but more importantly your money will get you a lot more so you can afford to live like millionaires in a little perfect town and a huge house. Matt Damon fed up with his life, experiencing money problems and unable to afford a house decides the best option for him and his wife is to downsize and live the life they've always wanted. Well things don't go according to plan for poor Matt Damon and that's about the point where the movie decides to take a sharp turn in another direction. I wasn't relishing the idea of seeing a depressed mini Matt Damon for 2 hours 15 minutes so the introduction of Christoph Waltz and Hong Chau was exactly what the story needed. So although I feel the second half of the movie differs so much in tone it does feel like you're watching a whole new movie I enjoyed Downsizing for the most part. For all its problems and lack of focus it makes up for it with unexpected and random bursts of hilarity. Not the easiest rating I've ever given, I didn't love it but I didn't hate it. A great idea, with a very good script so I can't help but feel like it should have been better. Recommended if you're looking for something a little bit different."

      "text": "What could've been an astounding social commentary piece ends up to be a multi-faceted disjointed disaster piece. Downsizing focuses on the good Samaritan character Paul Safranek as he ventures the downsized world with some realizations and disappointments without delving into any of the important societal issues, but simply stating them and moving into cliche stories of characters. Payne misses the mark with the great cast and occasional humor, ultimately dooming Downsizing the chance to become politically important."

      "text": "In order to extend our planet's life span, a technique is invented that shrinks people down to 5\", so their energy usage and waste is greatly reduced. Matt Damon plays the man caught in this tiny world after his wife abandons him. Once the novelty of the small vs. large wears off, what's left is a forceful ecological lesson. Luckily, it includes his relationship with a Vietnamese woman (Hong Chau in a delightful and sometimes touching breakout performance). This adds a level of human responsibility and expands the message to compassion for one's fellow earthlings. There's virtually no humor, so what looks like it could be fun turns into a mildly involving drama and a heavy-handed tract on the foilables of human nature and the dangers of disregarding our planet's health."

The initial premise of the film is set up well, but after around thirty minutes the film becomes a total mess and seems to have no idea where it is going, jumping from idea to idea throughout the rest of the duration. A total waste of time, I actually watched it again as I couldn't believe how poor the film was and I wanted to give it a chance to redeem itself. It didn't. There is a very good video essay on youtube called \"How Downsizing Cheated You\" which sums it up in quite a humorous way."

The trailer tries to sell this movie as a silly comedy, like Matt Damon's \"Stuck On You.\"  While the movie does have some silly, comedic bits, it's main focus is a satirical take on modern consumerism.  If you go into the film expecting to be rolling on the floor laughing, you're going to be disappointed.\"Downsizing\" is to modern 21st century mass consumerism as Voltaire's \"Candide\" was to 18th Century Leibnizian Optimism.  Both works take the perspective of a generic everyman to illustrate the flaws in the times they live in and the mindset of the people around them.  And in both works, the main character starts off seemingly indoctrinated by the world around them and proceeds to live through experiences that cause disillusionment.  I won't spoil the ending, but if you didn't like \"Candide,\" you're probably not going to like \"Downsizing.\"It's not a comedy.  It's meant to be a thought-provoking, satirical commentary on rampant, self-destructive consumerism.  It does an acceptable job at that, though if you go into the movie blind like I did, you'll endure about an hour and a half of \"where is this movie going\" confusion."

Yes, it has its heart in the center of it and has genuine effort in writing and direction but it completely fails on offering the audience what they were promised. Surprisingly as we know, it has a premise of an animated feature and much like it, it is finely detailed as it had to create its own world (in a way) and this is the only note where the movie scores for these little amusing things are the only thing helping one survive this overlong script. Downsizing lacks a gripping screenplay, better editing, fast pacing and a particular palpable environment (it fluctuates a lot; the first act is completely different than the others, it doesn't quite fits in). Matt Damon and Christoph Waltz are equally good in it but surprisingly so is Hong Chau; she is perfect in her role. And in the end, Alexander Payne is the man responsible for all of it and as far his direction or execution is concerned he puts all his effort in each and every frame; one can completely see it, but on the writing part he fails to either surprise or entertain the audience. Downsizing is sweet and beautiful filled with hope (not for the viewers though) but has an overlong second act and a disappointing climax."

Where is the accountability? Matt Damon is a great actor and will rebound, but unfortunately I will forever see him as the main in this complete waste of resources and time. The writer and director as well as the producers should collectively be ashamed of themselves and especially Damon, whom I believe to know better than this. Each ticket should come with a complimentary cyanide capsule."

If you watch the trailer for this movie it promises you a fun, comedic jaunt about the trials and tribulations of being small in a big world. What you ended up with is a long-winded, boring guilt trip about being human and destroying the planet. I'm not sure how this movie was even listed as a comedy, as I can't recall a single laughable moment throughout the whole film. Everything from the storyline, to the dialogue, to the on-screen performances, felt like the cinematic equivalent of a valium induced coma.

The next thing we see is Paul\u2019s life in Leisure World and meet his obnoxious neighbor played by Christoph Waltz.  At this point, the movie takes a left turn and becomes a whole different movie.  And, we meet a Vetnamese woman (Hong Chau) who becomes an important character.  There is het another plot twist before the end.  At this point, it begins to sound like a ride at Epcot.

Paul Safranek (Damon) is the married American everyman who is just gets by and becomes intrigued the more he hears about the Norwegian doctor, played by Rolf Lassgard, that his project of shrinking humans is successful plus he hears from others including some old friends that he didn\u2019t know had gone through the project and has nothing but raves about it. When Paul learns what little money he has would be worth about $12 million in Leisureland where this new species of humans live in a perfect world.As Paul learns about this new world so do we and we follow him in his journey meeting his new friends two aging party guys, Christopher Waltz and Udo Kier, into booze, drugs, women playing and using them as if they were frat boys. One of the benefits of everything being small is made fun of with Kier owning a fully equipped yacht that he has Fedex\u2019d where he goes to get there before him.We eventually meet Ngoc Lan, played by Hong Chau, while she cleans Waltz's apartment, right above Paul\u2019s, who at one time was a famous Vietnam dissident, who now lives in a tenement world of various Third World people who are sick and ill-equipped to take care of themselves. Ngoc wears a prosthetic device, is direct taking no nonsense and spending her time before, during and after cleaning places taking care of others.Without giving away any spoilers Paul and Ngoc with her bossing him around and they eventually team up with Waltz and Kier going to Norway to hear about the next step in saving the world.While not getting too deep into the world situation but explaining enough plainly the journey Paul takes from being the normal guy then going through the shrinkage steps, which provides a few laughs, becoming adapted to being rich, taking a dead end job and a decision he has to make near the end is the arc of drama of the film.Matt Damon does an excellent job as Paul, Christopher Waltz and Udo Kier are a hoot as the two aging playboys but it is Hong Chau who steals the film and has a 4-5 minute bit using the \u2018f\u2019 word that, while funny also has a lot of feelings.There are cameos by Laura Dern, Margo Martindale, Neil Patrick Harris, Jason Sudeikis, Maribeth Monroe and James Van Der Beek among others while the aforementioned Rolf Lassgard along with Kristen Wiig offers strong support.\u201cDownsizing\u201d is the second film I have seen this week, the other being \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d, that have been snubbed by the critics but which offer strong performances by the male lead, with the former also having an award worthy female lead, and is definitely worth seeing.Rated R for language, drug usage and frontal nudity."

      "text": "I assumed Downsizing would be light entertainment to kill a couple of hours before meeting friends in the food court. Instead, it riveted my attention from the beginning.The silly premise of people, en masse, shrinking down to five inches is the vehicle for an existential work of art more akin to Camus' The Plague, or Kafka's The Metamorphosis, than 'Honey, I Shrank the Kids'. To reduce the human carbon footprint, a scientist discovers a way to shrink people down to five inches. Not only will small people consume less but their personal wealth will increase in inverse proportion to their new size as their tiny houses and other necessities of life will now cost pennies on the dollar. This increase in wealth is the marketing tool used to entice customers to downsize.   The movie opens at a scientific conference to announce the discovery of the transformational process. But the cutting-edge scientific tone soon shifts to a campy small town setting where the main character, Paul Safraneck, played by Matt Damon, is seen caring for his sick, aged mother. Both tone and settings kept ricocheting off in unexpected directions like marbles in a pinball machine. Worlds meld into worlds. A tunnel connects an idyllic small community to its dystopian counterpart of bleak carton-sized cement blocks of tiered units that house the poor and disenfranchized. Another tunnel is like the stuff of dreams, where the dreamer must choose to proceed one way or the other, forever sealing his fate depending on which way he goes. An Avatar-like forest filled with a lush extravagance of giant leaves and flowers seem magical from the perspective of people five inches tall. A scene of workplace banter among medical techs in a huge transformation plant seems mundane enough until a door opens and the giant head of a 'big' co-worker fills the doorway.   But rather than feeling disjointed, the constantly shifting tone and settings are more like the whorls and eddies in a swiftly flowing mountain stream, with Paul a leaf floating Zen-like atop the ever-changing current. Matt Damon's acting talent shines as Paul is repeatedly thrust into bewildering circumstances and meets them with an expression of pure receptivity, the receptivity usually seen in children who find themselves in a perplexing adult situation and stand, transfixed, soaking everything up like a sponge.  It's the receptivity to ever-changing circumstance and banishment of desires that's been timelessly advocated by Eastern mystics. I'd always assumed that by 'desire' these wisdom traditions meant desiring material things like cars and houses, or the more ephemeral desires of ambition and competition. But Paul not only has no interest in material wealth, which he shows by moving out of his tiny mansion into an apartment, neither does he have any 'What's in this for me?' or 'How do I get out of this mess?' personal agenda. He's neither self-pitying or rageful as his new small life goes unexpectedly wrong. He doesn't seem to desire anything - only to immerse himself in the flow of his new life, doing whatever is required of him in every shifting situation.   I never knew what the Zen virtue of egolessness looked like before. Now I do. It looks like Paul Safranek.   Paul has an unassuming presence. He runs like Forest Gump. His good nature is evident from the beginning when he rushes home from his job as an industrial occupational therapist to care for his sick mother. Only later do we learn the great sacrifice he made career-wise to move back home to care for her.   A number of highly creative scenes are memorable, like when Paul struggles to carry a beautiful normal sized rose as a gift to a neighbor. Or the eerily real dialogue when trapped in a car with a stranger, he's forced to make polite conversation immediately after receiving a devastating loss. Or the visually surreal ballet without music as hundreds of still anesthetized newly made small people are adeptly scooped up onto spatulas and placed in carts for transport by giant techs with all the precision and repetitive motion of workers on an assembly line. A wordless backward glance at an old man in a wheelchair chomping down on a cold piece of chicken says everything necessary about who Paul is, and what motivates him.   The only reason I didn't give Downsizing a 10 is because I found the role of Tran played by Hong Chou just a bit too abrasive.   As the movie neared the end, something made me look away from the screen and around the darkened theatre. It was something odd I sensed. Only about a dozen other people were there with me. But there was no crinkling of candy wrappers, no shifting in seats. There was an atmosphere of deep silence, a collective of mental energy inwardly focused, like in a church where only a handful of people are sitting or kneeling, intent only on their prayers. Not surprising, since Downsizing is ultimately a deeply spiritual movie."

      "text": "\u201cDownsizing\u201d was directed by Alexander Payne who, with Jim Taylor, wrote the story and screenplay. The film stars Matt Damon, Christoph Waltz, Kristen Wiig and Hong Chau. I went to this film expecting to see an elaboration of a very tempting trailer but, unfortunately, the best part of the film was, in fact, all in the trailer itself. What starts out with a very intriguing concept, i.e. shrinking human beings to a height of 5 inches with a proportionate environment around them, loses itself in the first 30 minutes and travels in a number of different directions, most of which involve the writer\u2019s political statements about climate change and the harm humans are doing to the planet. Also, to add another negative to the film is the role played by Thailand actress Hong Chau and what has to be the worst attempt ever made at imitating a Vietnamese \u00e9migr\u00e9. Simply stated, she ruins each scene in which she appears with this \u2018chalk on a blackboard\u201d dialogue. Couple all of this with plot changes and ideas that make no sense and you have a disappointing and uncomfortable 135 minutes. I give the film a rating of 6.02 because of what it started out to be, and could have been, but unfortunately went downhill in mid reel. In summary, all of Mr. Payne\u2019s efforts as director and co-writer of this film came up short (pun intended)."

Actually, the main theme is hard to describe as it seems to change a few times but that doesn't ruin the movie at all.I feel like people get some expectations based on the trailer and get them shattered during the movie, hence the low rating so far. I expected nothing more than good acting when I saw the cast and was not disappointed at all."

      "text": "Ethan's Review: Let me just start off by saying this is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen, the other movie that comes close to this movie by being the worst is \"Mother\", and that's saying something. The premise is what got me, along with Matt Damon. Who doesn't like Matt Damon? My friend Sequoyah after this movie (who will be typing his review after mine. Let's just say the only part of the movie I enjoyed was the Vietnamese character, only because of the racist stereotype that they show in this movie. To conclude, just don't watch this film. Don't even rent on redbox. Sequoyah's Review:If i could change history and choose between stopping 9/11 or stopping Matt Damon from acting in this movie, I would pick the latter in a heartbeat. This movie is like having pins shoved into my urethra and then someone poured lemonade on it, with nice salt and a garlic to finish it off. The only good thing about this movie is the philosophical question asked by the Vietnamese lady \"What kinda **** you give me?\", I spent 12.00 dollars on this... To sum it all up, this movie was terrible. Do not watch it."

      "text": "I saw Downsizing last night and immediately after I would have given it a 6, but after letting it sink in, the film really resonated with me.  At this point I will give it a 10.  I'm going to make this a spoiler free review, in the hope that some people will see it based on my experience.  The film speaks to issues of global warming and who we should be spending our life with knowing that we're destroying our environment and possibly destroying ourselves as a species.  I really feel like I now have a better understanding of how I want to live my life in the face of climate change.  It also feels like a feature film version of a Black Mirror episode.  I love Black Mirror, so if you're a fan of that show you'll probably have a great time watching Downsizing."

Among all the other tiny people movies we have watched so far such as Gulliver's Travel which focuses on comedy but Downsizing focuses on the feelings and emotions. If you liked the trailer definitely you gonna love the movie as well."

      "text": "Downsizing is a film with a very intriguing idea with promising world building, but ultimately fails to capitalize on its own concept and instead opts for a poorly executed political message that conflicts with its subject matter.I will say the first act of the movie does a great job of setting up its world building by having its dialogue grounded in its sci-fi premise of humanity able to shrink down to a few inches to create a whole new society where they only need a fraction of the resources they would consume as normal sized beings and effectively live a life of wealth. Unfortunately once the 2nd act, its entire premise becomes completely trivial, to the point where its Sci-Fi premise is practically meaningless. And it also doesn't help that the story we have now is driven by a main character who is completely bland and uninteresting, not to mention that he seemingly fails to make any meaningful decisions for himself until the very end to run back for a cheesy romance subplot that lacks any chemistry."
