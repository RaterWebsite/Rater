First, the characters. They were TRYING to make the sloth, Sid, a wise-cracking, chatter-box, but didn't wasn't that the Donkey from \"Shrek\" who offered us that character who we'll probably remember for the rest of our life as he was one of the best characters in an animated film ever? Or how about the wolly mamoth, Manner (or Manny, or Manfred, or whatever your supposed to call him)? Didn't his personality and attitude remind you of Shrek of \"Shrek\"? And to top it all off, the \"tear-jerker\" of the movie. The movie was TRYING to be as heartwarming, and tear-jerking as \"Monsters, Inc.\" but you just couldn't get that feeling when M (I wasn't sure what to call the mamoth so I settled for \"M\") remembers how his parents died, or when it looks as though Diego has died, or when M and co. bring the baby back to his dad.

Directed by Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha, has voice actors like Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Denis Leary. It was nominated for the Oscar for Best Animated Film.This is not a film I consider remarkable, but it's funny enough to not consider for lost the time I spent watching it. Although not easy to understand for young children, the film is appealing enough. Playing with the animals existing at the time, the script creates a situation, implausible but funny, involving a human child and a group of animals, predators and preys, united in a joint effort.The characters are not the most interesting but Diego, a tiger torn between loyalty to his brothers and friendship with fellow travelers, and Manfred, a mammoth mourning his dead family, deserve some positive highlight, giving the film a touch of maturity. The more negative note goes to Sid, an unpleasantly greenish sloth, which associates a grotesque aspect to an endless collection of stupid moments. Unfortunately, this creature is the largest attempt to make this movie something funny. The intelligent humor of other characters works better, making more digestible a film that, without it, it would be quite silly. The squirrel can also be very funny.The work of animators is regular and fulfills its role. The voice actors did a good job, particularly Leguizamo, who gave voice to Sid.

Everyone else will get through it ok as the humor is decent and the film does have some heart and quiet moments as opposed to bombarding you with obnoxiousness.

Despite this, it delivers some solid laughs and the backgrounds are surely appealing to the eye. Although it clocks in at just a pultry 81 minutes, it feels a little slow in some parts and the animation is a bit simplistic compared to Pixar and DreamWorks. Nevertheless, Ice Age succeeds in delivering the funny and will surely delight people of all ages."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Story:\r3 prehistoric animals from the Ice Age-Manny, a mammoth, Diego, a saber-tooth tiger, and Sid, a sloth-find a human baby away from its tribe. They decide to bring the baby back to the tribe as they're being led by Diego who might have something up his sleeve. The story here is pretty basic and predictable, and there's no surprises here. There's also a subplot with a saber-tooth squirrel named \"Scrat\", and in it we follow his misadventures as he tries to get an acorn. Besides that, the plot here is nowhere near the creativity of Pixar. 5/10\r Animation:\rUnfortunately, the animation didn't really age well. Over 12 years after its release, it's animation is severely outdated with the colors and textures looking below average by today's standards. Even the character models look outdated. Good thing Blue Sky updated them in the sequel. Overall, it's animation may have been good back in 2002, but unfortunately, it didn't age well. 4/10\r Characters and Comedy:\rThis is where things get better. When it comes to our 3 heroes, all 3 of them are likeable. And it's all thanks to that baby they have. That baby is the centerstone that this film needed as it's responsible for all the character development and heartwarming moments that this film has. Manny starts off as a grouchy mammoth, but as the film progresses, it becomes clear that he has a dark past that he tries to hide and that it's explained why he dislikes the baby at first. Diego was sent on an objective, but after spending time with the crew and the baby, he slowly opens up to them. Finally, Sid is the comic relief character who isn't too annoying and is generally funny. Manny and Diego eventually grow to like him as he tries to form a \"herd\" with them. There's also Scrat who is hilarious as his style of comedy resembles the Looney Tunes style of humor. He's silent, but with all the attempts he makes to get that acorn, he quickly becomes a big highlight of the film, and eventually Blue Sky\"s mascot.  So the characters are likeable and have a bit of depth, and the comedy is great here. 8/10\r Sound:\rThe score is fine, but nothing memorable or amazing. 6/10\r Acting and Casting:\rAll the voices here do a great job, even if John Leguizamo can become occasionally too much to bear. I also like Scrat's voice, so props to Chris Wedge for his voice. 9/10\r Verdict:\rIce Age was a great start for Blue Sky Studios because of its great style of humor and great performances all around. Even though it's now a bit dated, this is an animated film that can still be enjoyed by everyone.\r Rating: 8/10"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This one is a fun comedy flick!\r The movie holds it self quite well with good use of slap-stick comedy that I am sure many can enjoy, the simplicity of the story is good enough to keep the goal of the main characters direct and be easy to fallow for the younger audience; the animation is very fast and energetic, it helps the slap-stick of the movie but the writing needed some work, specially when it comes to dialog and continuity.\r I also felt that some of the textures were very ugly and every times the movie tried to be taken serious it failed to be, I just scratched my head at all those scenes... but for the rest I found it to be a very fun and enjoyable movie overall."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "I do not understand all the positive reviews and why most people like it, i found it really boring and dull. I found the plot to very poor and predictable, the jokes and story were infantile, not interesting enough to interest older audiences. The characters were also very charmless, boring and forgettable. I'm glad I brough the film cheap as I won't be watching it again."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "\"Ice Age\" is generally original, and while it is able to entertain, its story is generally packed with so many plots that it can get carried away. Characters are interesting, but not outstandingly executed, and some can give solid laughs to audiences.
