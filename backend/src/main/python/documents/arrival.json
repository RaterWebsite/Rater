This is so self-important and ponderously dull that it makes Ingmar Bergman's depressive dramas seem like comic farces. The screenplay is all **** and pretension in which Amy Adams' language specialist amazingly deciphers the black ink vocabulary of the extra-terrestrials in record breaking time. A feat that only ever happens in the movies. The creatures themselves look like a cross between giant squids and an elephant's foot, and it's no exaggeration to state that their presence is underwhelming. The first ten minutes promise much but we never get that film. Instead as soon as the alien pods arrive degeneration in to boredom is immediate and sleep inducingly effective. Praised by the highbrow critics, make no mistake this is alarmingly over rated. A totally confused and uninteresting example of the sci-fi genre. Arrive? It certainly did.

If you're looking for a movie about aliens, this is not it. It really has nothing to do at all with aliens. It's a weak tug at heart strings depicting a story about a parent that loses a child. The chemistry between the two main actors is non existent. Just a terrible waste of 2 hours."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Not great. As others have said, it is slow. Also, it feels like they just did a wikipedia search for \"linguistics\" and then wrote a script around the first paragraph. I don't see this as a cerebral sci fi film at all.

It is one of the best rated and reviewed films of 2016, and is drawing comparisons to Close Encounters of The Third Kind, but I have a question, did they watch the same film that I did? I wasn't crazy about Close Encounters, but that movie was leaps and bounds ahead of this one. Twelve alien crafts land in random places all across the planet, and the people are in a panic. Some countries react with hostility, but the U.S. Government decides to act cautiously (yeah right), and send Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), the best linguist they have, to figure out a way to community with the aliens. The aliens, turn out to be giant octopus, whose language turns out to be ink that they squirt into the air. This movie features flashbacks and flash-forwards, that seemingly make no sense, until the end when you finally figure out what they mean and once you do, you realize that you just wasted two hours of your life. If that wasn't bad enough, the film moves at an absolute snails pace, I mean you could take everything that actually happened in the film and squeeze it into about twenty minutes. The rest is just people talking to each other about the same damn thing over and over again. Trying to figure out the same thing over and over again. Worrying about the same things over and over again. The characters have no personality whatsoever, and you might think that it's one of those slow moving weird films that all comes together in an amazing ending, but no, it doesn't. Once you can see the whole picture, as one lady in the theater so eloquently shouted out, \"really, that's it, that was so stupid.\" Her uncontrolled outburst really sums up this entire film. Honestly I think the slower and more artistic a film is, the more the critics love it, but I am one critic who isn't fooled by great actors and emotional music, this isn't the best film of the year, this is the biggest turd of the year, and it should be avoided at all costs!"}, {"rating": "2", "text": "boooooring.

Tried my very hardest to enjoy this movie, but failed to do so.  One film critic graciously rated this as: wait until it comes out in DVD.

Arrival falls into the latter.It's a little slow for multiple viewings, but it poses an interesting idea and a mystery that you'll be as eager to figure out as the characters."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I don't think this movie is about that \"what makes us human\". Personally I think it is about creating your own reality. The whole movie developes around the ability of a character to understand a language. In a way, Adams' character is a child (humanity) learning to speak. She has to go through all the tribulations of learning a new language, a powerful one at that. The premise is quite interesting and it took me two views to get it: Your language (the way you express what you think) determines your reality. They even mention it at the beginning of the movie, with the Sapir-Whorf theory. This is by far a very metaphysical proposal, and a very adecuate one at that, one that has been told to us by great master of ancient (\"For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned\"). In a way, language IS reality, it is the only way we have to describe it and thus create it. So it would make sense that a more powerful language would create a different, more powerful reality. In the movie, learning the aliens' language would opne the doors of time and space for you, and this can be wither a weapon (as first understood by humans) or a gift, as later realized by Adams. Of course the ability to thread between past, present and future could be a powerful weapon, or a great gift. Once she realizes this, it is quite interesting that she still chooses to have her baby, aware of the outcome, but the most important choice she makes, while having the ability to visit the past or future, is to live in the present. Powerful message indeed. So now you know, choose your words carefully."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "An intriguing film with an interesting concept of first  contact with aliens.

I liked the nostalgic flashbacks shown, a reminder of childrens curiosity and wonder when faced with seeing certain things for the first time. Its a relatively atmospheric film, with looming music used in the background, not dissimilar to that present in other previous sci-fi films, most notably Close Encounters of the Third Kind. It also reminded me somewhat of Jodie Foster in the film Contact from the 1990s.Its a somewhat deep film that makes you think about how threats are handled, at a global level, the responses by various governments and the like. If anything, I found it refreshing that in this instance, the US didn't exactly go in 'all guns blazing' and I appreciated that the main character, Louise Banks, tries very hard to understand and see things from the unknowns' point of view.

With this, the movie brings a new look to the sci-fi genre, as it deals with themes and emotions that many can relate to in the modern world. Arrival proves to be one-of-a-kind and one of the best in the genre, not just for pure action or the cliches we tend to see in such movies, but for its creativity and thought-provoking ideas it presents to the viewer. It is a movie that does require utmost attention, however, the experience is truly rewarding, as director, Denis Villeneuve continues his run of exceptional movies. Amy Adams, who plays a linguistic professor, leads the movie with a strong performance, yet playing a vulnerable character who succumbs to the events that unfold. The 'arrivals' themselves are wonderfully designed and their language particularly is a topic in on itself. Crafted with great cinematography and moving music, this was a deserved Oscar-nominated film, and truly one for the ages."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This movie is not for everyone. If you wanted a science fiction action blockbuster then you will be disappointed. However it is one of the most brilliant plots in scifi. I won\u2019t spoil the details but once you understand the twist it\u2019s just magnificent. It is a movie worth to discuss with friends and very memorable because it does something completely different. The ideas for follow up stories are basically endless. It is based on the book \u201cThe story of her life\u201d if I am correct. Also all actors were the right choices for their respected rolls. I think this will be a forgotten masterpiece because it is not mainstream enough. Sorry for not going in in details, but it will ruin the movie. Think about the twist in \u201cThe sixth sense\u201d.

A much discussed and sometimes feared story has come true which, honestly, always sounded a bit ridiculous to actually happen in the real world.I am, of course, talking about this new sci-fi drama \u201eArrival\u201c where mankind is greeted by huge alien spaceships in the sky who seem to be coming in peace\u2026 wait, did you think I was referring to Trump becoming the next leader of the free world?But yeah, these two events have a very similar plot summary so it\u2019s only fitting that I had the chance to experience them in the very same morning.Directed by Denis Villeneuve \u2013 the man behind \u201ePrisoners\u201c, mindbending \u201eEnemy\u201c with Jake Gyllenhaal, \u201eSicario\u201c and currently filming \u201eBlade Runner\u201c sequel \u2013, one could expect \u201eArrival\u201c to be a thinking person\u2019s sci-fi. And one is not wrong.It is a 116 minute slow-burner all heavy on atmosphere and light on explosions or any quick thrills. If you wish a quick reference to any recent well-known movies, the result is a bit like Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201eInterstellar\u201c crossed with Terrence Malick\u2019s \u201eThe Tree of Life\u201c. Robert Zemeckis\u2019s \u201eContact\u201c (1997) would not be very far either, because \u201eArrival\u201c also focuses on fragile yet brave female protagonist whose quality acting is one of the main pillars carrying the whole experience. The other one would be overall atmosphere, deliciously dark and ominous. Some will like it, others will probably find it depressing and maybe a bit slow for their taste.I haven\u2019t read the award-winning short story by Ted Chiang that \u201eArrival\u201c is based on. Wikipedia says that the major themes explored are determinism, language and Sapir-Whorf hypothesis which sounds mighty dry and mostly sci-fi geek friendly. So it\u2019s nice to witness movie makers adding some mainstream appeal which comes mostly in the form of Amy Adams\u2019s great performance. She truly holds the movie together as a woman going where no-one has ever gone before. You will believe her hesitations, the tears, and also the silent determination when the going gets tough. This kind of role is tricky because of the need to play it out mostly alone, often in close-up where every detail and tone has to be clearly seen and felt. Think Matthew McConaughey's mighty turn in \u201eInterstellar\u201c but decidedly less showoffish.So it\u2019s mostly Adams\u2019s one-woman-show, and a quite rare chance to see her doing something memorable and worthwhile on screen. She accepts too many decorative pretty girl roles, even in more ambitious projects. The all-male supporting cast is good too, especially star players such as Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker. As stated above, I don\u2019t know the original story but \"Arrival's\" message is rather spiritual and not \"dry\" at all. Essentially it is a reminder that mankind\u2019s future depends heavily on our ability to understand and connect to the world, rather than attacking and overpowering everything we find foreign or downright alien. It\u2019s a call to rise above the inflexible ego-based mind the western society so dearly values, and to find balance with our intuitive side.Overall, \u201eArrival\u201c is a good movie although I wasn\u2019t especially happy with the final act which seemed rushed. It felt like somebody grew impatient near the end and wanted to add something \u201eimpressive\u201c just in case the people were not happy with this slow-moving tale. I do not want to talk about it here in detail but, for me, it lessened some of the movie\u2019s overall impact. Mostly because there was not enough time to play it out as properly as the stuff that had come before.But yeah, if you are into more intelligent sci-fi and don\u2019t prioritize explosions, \u201eArrival\u201c is good to go."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Arrival is an excellent offer by sci-fi director Denis Villeneuve, and I think he is going to be our generation's great sci-fi director.

Arrival explores various linguistic and psychological theories and takes them to an extreme, even using them as the crux for its storytelling. While it does benefit the viewer to be familiar with psychological concepts, especially linguistic determinism, the film does a good job explaining the fundamental concepts the story is based upon. Arrival is not only a cautionary tale but also a hopeful one. Arrival purports that through cooperation and coordination, i.e. through avoiding competition, a future which benefits more to a greater degree can be achieved.
