I am definitely looking forward for the Real RocknRolla. The movie is action packed and funny. Some people say that the plot twists are too predictable, but I ask them, what plot twists their are none. It's just a flowing movie of awesome. Lots of people compare it to snatch, however it's completely different. Snatch happens in the little league gangs of east london, while as RocknRolla is with the high rollers of West London."

      "text": "RocknRolla tells an engaging story, a surprise in itself given just how many character arcs are taken on, but screenwriter-director Guy Ritchie handles this monumental task well, each group of characters have their own individual story unfold, but crossover and intertwine with others until the conclusion, where the plot drives each of the characters to the one place. I am reminded of Grand Theft Auto IV and its two DLC (\"The Lost and the Damned\" and \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\") and how the main characters' stories, while on the whole entirely different affairs, crossover at certain points, maybe its just me, but that's a narrative technique that I find admirable. The cast pull it off with an aplomb, I mean, come on, Gerard Butler, Tom Hardy, Mark Strong and Tom Wilkinson to name but a few, this movie's casting is nothing short of inspired. But most important of all, the cast seem to have fun with their roles, and it's awesome to see actors who enjoy what they do not just for the extensive salary, but for the joy of acting itself."

      "text": "RocknRolla brings an ensemble cast, some who have done extremely well in life after this film, and have thrown them into a very fast-paced and pulsating film that doesn't come up for air.\rThis isn't necessarily bad, Guy Ritchie, after all, is the writer and director of this British crime/comedy film, and he does an exceedingly good job at integrating each cast member to be of a particular use when the time comes.\rSo One Two (Gerard Butler) and Mumbles (Idris Elba) are basically thieves, if the complex story is to be believed, and they owe quite a debt to underground crook Lenny Cole (Tom Wilkinson) and his associate, Archie (Mark Strong), who lead in an awfully witty and humorous script that is up there with the best of Ritchie's films.\rThere is a vast array of characters who all play minor parts in the big picture, literally, because a painting lent to Cole has been stolen and is being traced down. Tom Hardy, Ludicrous, Jeremy Piven, Toby Kebbell and the cunning yet beautiful Thandie Newton, all play pivotal roles to create a largely entertaining crime film of the Ritchie tradition.\rIt does, however, have its shortcomings. The plot is a little complex to the point where it can sometimes be too quick, or too much going on to even give a damn to pay attention to the actual story and instead enjoy the action moments. There is also the problem of a large part of the cast being under used or not really standing out in their roles, apart from maybe Thandie Newton, Mark Strong and Tom Wilkinson, the rest just appear to be going along for the sake of it. Toby Kebbell is also annoyingly memorable in his role.\rBut these small problems aside, this is still and excellent and enjoyable film, with the cinematography being of true excellence, highlighting particular scenes to show their importance, or just to add depth, like most Guy Ritchie films. The witty and smart script is catchy and noteworthy, with plenty of British slang and quips to amuse the best of us, and is well delivered from the talent at show, some more so than others.\rit has all the potential to be a classic, with its underlying humour and glitzy take on crime in London, but a few minor story details and over-abundance of characters stop it from being masterful."

It is one of the greatest, most interesting, thrilling, satisfying movies ever. The story has some great unexpected twists and literally kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through, ok so its a little complicated but if you stick with it then you'll love it. The action sequences are awesome and original and I wouldn't swap just one of them for the ALL of the action sequences in Quantom of Solace. Plus the acting and characters are truly superb. All of it comes together to form something so unbelievably amazing that you simply HAVE to see it.

First it drug on a little in a couple spots and the dance scene was kinda stupid. Otherwise the movie was fantastic, I loved the robbery scene, I don't think I have laughed that hard in a long time.

The movie is more of a cult-hit sort of a deal where majority of the public will not be impressed, but a selected few will absolutely adore it. If you have seen Guy Richies previous work then, its more or less of the same thing (not a bad thing). If you plan to watch it however, I strongly recommend doing so alone or in a small group, DO however turn on the subtitles even if you are a native speaker, since some of the witty jokes are thrown out so casually you might not even notice em. The movie plays mostly off the atmosphere and interesting characters with the story taking a back seat most of the way. I have seen it 3 times and I noticed new things on each sitting(also understood the story as a whole after the final sitting)."

Ritchie steals too much from previous films, the snitch boss a-la Layer Cake was horribly predictable, the film tries hard to be Lock Stock and Snatch, but lacks in every department and simply winds up as an unintentional parody of Ritchie films. Poorly acted for the most part, poorly cast, poorly directed and hopeless editing and cutting leaves this film as a ghost of what most people expected it to be. Unbelievable and unrealistic this is more a pantomime than a movie."

However, if you've seen any of Mr Ritchie's previous films or the the great movie, Layer Cake, then this just seems jaded. In terms of the plot and characters, you can actually see where he's just lifted existing material (Johnny Quidd is the same as Mickey in Snatch; Lenny is like Bricktop and the bad guy in Layer Cake... I could go on. ) This would not be so bad if it was improving on the earlier films but it isn't. If anything, Ritchie's just getting sloppier. There's rehashed dialogue and a couple of story lines that seem very unnecessary and lack any real conclusion. So overall, this is worth a watch if you fancy some mindless entertainment and liked his earlier work... but don't bother if you're looking for something new."

I winced at Tom Wilkinson's speech about the crayfish, it was basically lifted from Bricktop's speech about pigs in Snatch. At least Jason Statham wasn't in this one playing the same character he plays in every. single. film. Still, a boring rehash that feels about 5 to 10 years old, when films and tv shows about gangsters were cool. Let's face it --gangsters are pretty played at this point. Your time is better spent on his first two films, and, Guy, rather than making the promised sequel/s, why dont you try something new?"

Kinetic and chaotic as all of Guy Ritchie's films, RockNRolla is a smart and witty crime comedy that features the very best of Ritchie's skill in the director's chair. The acting, especially from Toby Kebbell, is terrific. The entire cast is very talented and showcased it in this thoroughly British affair. The film has some pacing issues, namely in the middle. The ending picks up and is decidedly the best part of the film. The beginning is also strong, whereas the middle falls apart and is loosely connected to the beginning and end at best. The biggest problem, however, is the plot. In the middle, as mentioned, things fall apart and this is certainly evident in the plot. Overly convoluted and hard to follow, RockNRolla may be wildly entertaining, funny, and British, but its plot needed somebody far smarter than I to fully comprehend all the moving parts, especially since the film itself seems uninterested in telling its story. That said, the characters are terrific, but the film needed to be more focused. RockNRolla is a funny and fun film, but would have benefited from a better story."

Unfortunately, this seemed to alienate most of his fans (who like him for his action comedies), making his best movie also his most despised movie.\r With \"RocknRolla\", Ritchie returns to his roots. The problem with that is that this movie is not as fast-paced as it needed be, not as funny as it should be, nor as innovative as it could be and therewith totally felt lacking of anything worth grabbing my attention.\r After being copied over and over by various directors during the early '00s, the style that made Ritchie famous gradually became repetitive and dull. While \"Revolver\" offered a whole new dimension to the genre by replacing most of the humor with philosophy and symbolism, \"RocknRolla\" felt like a rather soulless attempt in the exact opposite direction. It felt uninspired and rehashed, leaving me constantly longing for more.\r The only thing this movie adds to his older work is a bit of fan service to his gay audience, which by no means added anything of value to the average straight guy. Watching this movie and his later Sherlock Holmes movies, I'd say Ritchie sold his soul to commercialism and gave up trying to be an artist."
