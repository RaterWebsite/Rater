An extremely profitable franchise is unleashed.What did I think?Hey, you guys like Harry Potter? Then I\u2019ve got good news: Fantastic Beasts is the worthy spin-off that you\u2019re going to be really into for the next ten years or so. While it\u2019s darker than the original films, it\u2019s packed with subtle little nods to them that fans will adore, and the story (though somewhat complicated) is good enough to stand alone. It\u2019s tremendous fun to see the wizarding world through a 1920s lens \u2013 magical speakeasy, anyone? \u2013 and the inhabitants of Scamander\u2019s Pokeball-meets-TARDIS suitcase are just as fantastic as advertised. This film will frighten young children, but everyone else will be thoroughly enchanted."

The Story may not be Special but seeing the American side of the Wizarding World is Fresh and interesting and the Main cast also works for the most part. I personally find Newt an good Main Protagonist but i kind of missed that he gets no real development so the thing he says at the end is ironic. The Main Villain was fantastically played. I was invested in the World and the Beasts. The CGI was really good for the most Part, only the last showdown was a little to much in may opinion. I got to admit that this Movie is one of my favorite Harry Potter movies even it has probably not the same quality as some of the older ones."

      "text": "First of all, a majority of the casting for the characters was fantastic. Each actor or actress fit their respected role perfectly. This can be seen with Eddie Redmayne. He just played Newt in such a way that he was relatable. He was such a charismatic character that everybody loves. Also, Dan Fogler was hilarious as Jacob Kowalski. He had pretty much all of the funny lines in this film. He also was the audience character which was nice to have in a film like this. The score by James Newton Howard was incredible to hear. The costumes in this film, which are Oscar-winning, are fabulous. They look like they were taken out of a history book for what people might have worn in the 1920\u2019s. The last good thing I want to mention is the visual effects and set designs. Their production design was Oscar-nominated and you can see why. You can see how much detail went into each set that they wanted to show in this film. Same thing with the special effects. All the beasts and creatures in this film looked remarkable. Now some things that they could of fixed was the pacing in the film. The pacing was all over the place. It almost felt like they didn\u2019t know how to end some scenes or they thought the scene was too long and cut it too early. This also could be a cause of some poor editing. There were some awkward transitions in this film that didn\u2019t make sense. The last thing I want to mention is the plot holes. I feel like the writers had to ignore them or else there wouldn\u2019t have been a film. In the end, Fantastic Beasts is a stunning film that just has a few issues but I still recommend to watch."

In \u201cFantastic Beasts and where to find them\u201d there are those \u201cbeasts\u201d, but the problem is that the movie is not about them and has a single word about where to find them.The film begins with a battle of a group of mages and a mysterious dark sorcerer and a bunch of newspapers headlines about someone called Grindelwald. Who is it? That\u2019s a good question. If you want to know than go watch sequel, because he is not in this one. The twist of Grindewald\u2019s exposure is very weak, it simply leads to nothing. Throw it out of the movie and nothing will change. Oh, wait, if you do that than it wouldn\u2019t be so interesting to see the sequel. It\u2019s really sad when the first movie of a cycle tries to sell you the sequel.What is a real pity is the fact that the beasts are absolutely gorgeous, but there\u2019s too little screen time with them. The story just begins when some of them flee, later they become a secondary storyline, giving the first place to Creedence. He is a very powerful wizard, who turns into an obscurus, a dangerous magical creature, by suppressing his magical powers. And someone might say: \u201cBut here is your magical beast and a story about it!\u201d, but it is a very cheap move. The viewer clearly understands that the story of the beasts ends with the capturing of the last escaped creature, long before the end of the movie. Who is this Creedence guy? Why should I care for him? The whole movie feels like the creators just stuffed too much and didn\u2019t bother to make some part really good.But no everything is bad here. Eddy Redmayne (Newt) and Ezra Miller (Creedence) are superb in portraying their characters. You could watch this movie for their performances alone. It\u2019s difficult to say something good about other aspects of this film. The editing feels raggy and awkward, the stories are skin-deep, and the sequel baiting is frustrating. The movie had potential but it lacks of polishness almost in every aspect."

She violated the rules of her own world by approving this. Graves' wand connecting randomly? No, the cores of the wands have to be the same. That was reserved for the climax of three of the old movies, and they just throw it around here? No. And Obliviate rain? Give me a **** break. The people in the theater were laughing, I was crying inside.The movie's score, which in some bad movies is good, is completely terrible.

It lost most of the dark elements that I liked in Harry Potter, but we shouldn't be comparing this with the main series, since the movie feels like a standalone. It was shallow, digging only slightly in topics and themes. This ensured that the movie was entertaining to watch.. or was it? I personally found myself blanking out at moments during the movie and tried to look for a deeper meaning within the movie. I couldn't much apart from clich\u00e9s and an overall average movie.

Moving to 1920's America setting and removing the angsty teenagers who have to save the world because the negligent adults are too incompetent are both absolute improvements.Newt himself is an extremely underrated character, and brilliantly portrayed by Eddie Redmayne. See Pop Culture Detective's \"The Fantastic Masculinity of Newt Scamander\" on Youtube for a better examination, but I'll sum it up here: He's not macho or \"The Chosen One\" or a witty schmoozer. But he doesn't fall into the typical nerd/genius/outsider stereotypes either. He's quiet, introverted, humble and sensitive, but also confident in his abilities and sympathetic towards his beasts as well as humans.The only major downside to the movie was that it couldn't decide which movie it wanted to be: a lighthearted romp about chasing down escaped magical beasts, or a dark conflict between wizards, anti-wizard muggles, and dark wizards. I personally preferred the latter, but it would not make a lot of sense to have Newt in a movie purely about that (and of course the former also brings child appeal and toy sales to the table)."

      "text": "I really like this movie! BEST MOVIE IN 2016! Great acting. The beasts are fantastic. There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with that. But the picture \u2014 directed by David Yates, who also gave us the last four Harry Potter films, terrific ones \u2014 feels both sprawling and crowded, as if it were trying to pack too much mythology into one cramped crawlspace. Fantastic Beasts is a prequel, set years before Harry Potter was even a zigzag-lightning-scar-shaped gleam in his parents\u2019 eye: it\u2019s 1920s New York, and Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a \u201cmagizoologist\u201d with insider knowledge of all sorts of magical creatures, is just arriving from London. Stateside, it\u2019s a troubled and troubling time: the underground wizarding community is under threat, because a whirling black whatchamacallit has been forging a path of destruction through the New York City streets. To protect their ranks, the wizards must take great care to hide their powers from the No-Majs (the American term for Muggles). It doesn\u2019t help that a fanatical group, led by Samantha Morton\u2019s demonically prim Mary Lou Barebone, is out to break the wizards\u2019 ranks apart. Also, dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald has gone missing\u2014in case you happen to find that Fantastic Beasts doesn\u2019t have enough plot points for you to digest.Into this mess steps Scamander, hoping to research some new magical beasts and protect some that have become endangered. He happens to carry a number of such creatures in his mystically bottomless suitcase (more on that later), though their misbehavior ends up landing him, and the new friends he makes, in a great deal of trouble. Those misadventures involve an earnest, friendly No-Maj and aspiring baker, Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler); Tina Goldstein (Katharine Waterston), a \u201cStatute of Secrecy\u201d enforcer who misperceives what Scamander is up to and tries to turn him in to the wizarding officials; and Tina\u2019s sister, Queenie (Alison Sudol), a charming flapper-girl who can read minds as efficiently as a voracious grade-school reader tearing her way through all seven Harry Potter books.There\u2019s so much going on in Fantastic Beasts that after the first act, you almost can\u2019t be bothered to care what happens next. In the movie\u2019s world, there\u2019s a magical explanation for everything, which means story logic too often gets left by the wayside. (In the Harry Potter books, Rowling did a remarkable job of making magical logic seem consistent and believable, and the movie adaptations followed suit; that clarity has been lost here.) And even though the movie preaches tolerance, its ideas never quite jell. Still, Yates and Rowling are intent on working their charm on us, and some of it sticks: If Redmayne\u2019s performance is just too adorably mannered, Fogler and Sudol twirl through their roles like dance-floor champs \u2014 both have low-key, breezy allure."

But i really think that we needed more characters with more stories about them, so we could care about the plot. Because that's what the wizarding world was all about!

      "text": "We travel once again into the magical world of Harry Potter, several decades before the rise of You-Know-Who and the birth of The Boy Who Lived, by following the misadventures of Newt Scamander in America and discovering his Fantastic Beasts. In this misadventure we get a treat of a film that is a decent follow up to the masterpiece of its predecessor but stumbles a little on the execution.The biggest fault of the film is the story, or at least specific parts of it. The film is a little too obvious with its foreshadowing and setup, which distracts from the rest of the film. The entire subplot with the \"exposure of the magical world\" and the involvement of the \"Magical Congress of the United States of America\" (or \"MACUSA\") is interesting, but ultimately unnecessary for the movie until the sequels come out. When the film focuses on the Fantastic Beasts and Newt Scamander themselves, it shines, only to be rusted by the political overtones and the unneeded dark magic involved.The characters are all fun and very distinct. They all have very unique looks and actions to them that makes them memorable and likable.  The distinctions come to a disadvantage, however. The roles of each character is so obviously cliche that, if it weren't for the decent acting chops of all involved and the additional character tidbits added in, it would be rather painful. Newt is obviously the hero, Kowalski is obviously the comic relief, Tina is obviously the heroic girl and so on. The effects are a little questionable. It's easy to make out a lot of the CGI, and the filmmakers would have done well to use more practical effects. Especially for creatures that were on screen for a long time. For a movie that's based around them, that's a pretty big flaw.The movie is good, but it could have been much better. If they cut out the subplots and add in more practical effects, we could have had the Magical World equivalent of Jurassic Park. Instead we get an enjoyable movie that is bogged down by stories that are obviously meant to set up future sequels."

      "text": "Scamander's Lumos Maxima Is Sufficient For Another J.K. Rowling's HeptalogyIt was predicted by the selfsame Rowling: \"If I have a sufficiently powerful idea, I will come back\", it is. The return to the wizarding universe most acclaimed of all time was as logical and pressing as the return to Katniss Everdeen's Panem or a galaxy far, far away in \"Star Wars\". \"Fantastic Beasts\" fulfills all its aims with faultless expertise: conceiving the spinoff wished by all fanatics drawing on Harry Potter's rich mythology to forged a style of its own which stands out with power of franchise, introducing to the most apathetic or uninterested people of  Rowling's writings and laying a consistent foundations for extensive franchise which has in front of its wand.Seductive prequel begins in in the midst of the 1920s, in New York precisely, a period of economic prosperity. Magizoologist Newton \"Newt\" Artemis Fido Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) born in 1897, who was expelled from Hogwarts due to an incident with one of his beloved offsprings, does expeditions across five continents to register, protect\u2014from the most dangerous specimens in the planet, \"humans\u2014\" and categorize magical creatures in order to write a meticulous textbook of preservation about them, entitled \"Fantastic Beats and Where to Find Them\" (with a foreword written by Albus Dumbledore: \"Never tickle a sleeping dragon\"). These trips take him to 'The Big Apple', where meets the baker Jacob Kowalski (Dan Floger), who accidentally takes Scamander's fabulous carrying case. That mistake ends with the catastrophic opening of the suitcase, which four celestial animals escape (\"Night at the Museum\" style). While Kowalski, Scamander, Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) \u2014 a police belonging to the 'MACUSA' \u2014 and her charismatic sister Queenie (Alison Sudol) are in the exhaustive animal search and capture, in Europe, malicious and powerful dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) causes great vicissitudes, which will be connected ominously with animal chase in North America.The charm, excitement and fantasy projected before us were theoretically 'as if by magic', nonetheless, such magic is performed by explicit magicians. The first of them is who has been behind the art of wizards all this time, J. K. Rowling, who now holds the start of this new story with her own hands, since in addition to assembling almost naturally the new piece within Harry Potter's vast universe, wrote the screenplay of all the characters involved. British (screen)writer makes a well-built beginning as such; it's for that reason that first installment is crammed with information, narrative threads as: The Magical Congress of the United States of America (which is strictly dissimilar to the British), varied range of suggestive characters, meaningful range of facts, ambitious catalog of creatures and the presentation of who perhaps will be the king-villain of the saga (akin to 'Thanos' in \"MCU\").Second miracle worker is director-producer David Yates, who was in the middle of Gabonese jungle with \"The Legend of Tarzan\" in July and concluded masterfully the story of Harry, Ron and Hermione with \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 & Part 2\" in 2010 and 2011 respectively; he enigmatically returns to inaugurate a new and long chapter, which probably also will direct. His tremendous experience is imposed on the fluidity of the story, the refreshing and vital blocking and assiduous harmony of every complex aspect on the screen. It is open to view that Yates and Rowling are understood well and for the sake of their all 'muggles', that honest connection must endure.Our third magicians are the art, production and boundless special effects team, they demonstrated some of their aces under the sleeve, the others are kept for future films. Simply by the imaginative, surprising and sophisticated recreation of the 1920s, radiant \u2014and sometimes terrifying\u2014 creatures, thundering lightning flashes of wands, flying food and objects in the movie, parallel worlds of the suitcase of Newt and more are a compelling Academy Awards nomination. Maybe there is a little excessive use of CGI, but if the current blockbusters abusing technology for purposes like these, they have the clear path.Lastly, but no less important, the true wizards of the story. Oscar-winning Eddie Redmayne wears the coat that made Radcliffe shine in his time. The new hero for a new era of magic has an inherent connection with his stooped over way of walking, his shy personality and bangs manage to create an overwhelming and interesting atmosphere. His team is equally effective, however, Dan Floger (\"No-maj\") is who amuses us and provides part of the comicality in the film, and in addition, gives us glimpses of silent film. On the dark side of witchcraft and wizardry, Colin Farrell, Ezra Miller and the short cameo by Johnny Depp become the subplot into something scary, creepy and not too suitable for kids\u2014 substantially, pointing out in the excellent performances and background music by James Newton Howard.\"Fantastic Beasts\" fortuitously becomes us absent-minded of the original series, with a spin-off packed with magic, joy, new opportunities and surprises to come. The faithful muggles\u2014or No-maj\u2014 of Rowling have a lot to be happy with the return to the essence of Harry Potter with a golden and striking wrapping which promises fabulous visuals, stories, and possibilities. Open that suitcase, we are on the right way."

      "text": "'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' is the first screenwriting credit for \"Harry Potter\" author, J.K. Rowling, who plans on taking this beloved franchise and expanding it, since that is the current trend of Hollywood blockbusters, these days. Eddie Redmayne stars as Newt Scamander, a wizard employee at the Ministry of Magic who travels to New York. It's 1926, and Newt appears to be carrying around a case that seems to hold a living creature inside. He tries everything he can to retrieve the creature when it's escaped and starts to cause trouble, on the way, he runs into a man named Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) that takes one of Newt's mysterious eggs when he leaves it behind. Meanwhile, a woman named Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), another wizard is concerned that Newt may have let Jacob, who is a \"No-Maj\" - which is an American term for \"Muggle\", meaning non-magic humans - know too much about the wizard world, and his memory must be \"Obliviated\". But Jacob gets away with the egg, and Newt and Tina must get it back before more chaos ensues. Meanwhile, we meet a high-ranking Auror and Director of the Magical Security named Percival Graves (Colin Farrell) who appears to get close to a young boy named Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller) whose family seems to be holding some dark, magical secrets that Graves needs to know more about. Graves also discovers that there are some dark magic that invades the whole of New York, and it's up to Newt, Tina and Jacob to try and stop it. Seeing the few unlikely heroes reluctantly go on their unexpected journey together is fun and riveting, and the cast do an excellent job to get you invested in what might happen in future sequels... it appears that there will be four more movies to come out of this. The worst thing I can say about \"Fantastic Beasts\" is that, it's not \"Harry Potter\"... there is no young boy discovering the gifts of magic, there is little awe and it's not quite as whimsical. But, director David Yates - who directed the last four \"Harry Potter\" installments - keeps things balanced. The pacing of the story is a little uneven, as there are some amazing scenes where we discover a world of magical beasts, and there are some slow, scary and chilling moments about the dark magic. 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' isn't necessarily exciting, but it has made me curious for where the characters might go in future sequels. Whether or not this will match or even surpass the quality of the \"Harry Potter\" franchise, we will never know. But, if you watch it as a franchise on its own terms, it's still good! I liked the characters, I liked the creatures, I liked the new story... this is a franchise that should get more attention."

Sometimes it was fun, energetic, and charming (Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol). And sometimes it was bland and forgettable (Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston).I liked parts of it a lot. Even parts with wildly different tones and plots worked for me (even if they didn't necessarily work well together). In the end, however, it felt like a lot of potential and a lot of wasted opportunities. I think there could have been two really good films here, instead of one that was simply okay.I liked more than I disliked and there's definitely a lot of material left here to build a film franchise on (as they're planning to do). Unfortunately a horrible casting decision sucked out a good deal of my enthusiasm. That character reveal evoked laughter from the audience at my theater and *not* in a good way. It's the worst misstep in a movie that wasn't exactly perfect to begin.It was an entertaining movie and it was not a bad movie. I'd recommend it to fans of the Harry Potter universe for sure. I was mostly left wishing it had been better but I didn't regret having seen it."

CGI wasn't as good as I thought it would be, which was one of the let downs. But the niffler was an extremely adorable addition to the movie. I thought this movie was incredible and fun to watch. Good job Yates and Rowling!"

Are you a fan of harry potter? well this movie says dumbledore and hogwarts so come buy a ticket? Did you only see the movies and haven't kept up with anything J.K has made canon? Good luck keeping up with this movie. I feel like i should've had to buy two tickets to see this as it feels like two completely different plot lines put together into one convuluted mess. I do not recommend you see this movie for any reason."

      "text": "In 1926 a former Hogwarts student, Newt Scamander travels to New York with a case full of magical creatures only to find himself pulled into the strange world of magic in the United States, which is very different than Britain. The Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) is embroiled in a situation that threatens the safety of the wizarding community as well as the No-Majs (Muggles). It also jeopardizes the International Statute of Secrecy, risking the exposure of the wizarding world in America. Newt and his beasts may be just the thing needed to help bring to light the true forces at work.Us vs ThemThe Magical community has been hidden from the rest of the world since 1692 when the  International Confederation of Wizards enacted the International Statute of Secrecy to protect itself from Muggles or No-Majs. In America it has created an even stricter divide between the two worlds as witches and wizards are forbidden to marry non-magic folk. It's created a sense of superiority in the magical community which Tina clearly show when she says to Newt, \"Why would I want to marry him?\", pointing at Jacob, a No-Maj that has unwittingly become entangled in the wizarding world. The No-Maj world is no better. Mary Lou Barebone who runs an orphanage and the New Salem Philanthropic Society, works to indoctrinate the children she \"cares\" for and the people of New York of the dangers go witches and wizards in their midst. There is a real sense of tension that is palpable as each side cloisters in it's group, spreading fear of the other.The movie, in subtle ways, slowly undermines this idea of Us vs Them through the character of Jacob. In America, a No-Maj is immediately obliviated (a memory charm) so that they do not remember what they have seen, yet circumstances in the film make that impossible. Jacob and Newt form a friendship, learn from one another as they share their worlds. Jacob also has a major impact on Tina and Queenie Goldstein who, for the first time in their lives, get to spend significant time with someone from the \"other side\". It's beautiful to see the fear of the unknown vanish as communication leads to the awareness that they're not that different. In the real world where this happens every day, the message is clear, true knowledge of the \"other\" side only comes though interaction, communication and an open mind.The MovieThis is the first of five movies in the Fantastic Beasts series, written specifically for the screen by J.K. Rowling. There is a really strength to this since there are no books to compare it to leaving the audience free to enjoy the film for it's own sake. The movie does a good job of laying the foundations for the world of wizardry in this time period as well as what's to come in the series. The cast is outstanding, with the relationship between Alison Sudol as Queenie Goldstein and Dan Fogler as Jacob Kowalski being a true highlight. James Newton Howard's score is good, even if it never reached the heights of Williams and the production value, character design and world building is, well, magical. The film nicely begins it's journey to telling the history of the Harry Potter universe that we got hints of in the previous series, making it a wonderful addition and expansion to the world, yet, at the same time, it stands on it's own. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is rated 4 out of five Bowtruckles."

He came to America, to buy a rare magical beast.  His aspire just one : that to make the world of wizard have a better understanding about magical beasts. He come just in not in right moment where ther has been several phenomena in that could've blown the cover of wizards identity in America. Newt stop by in the ladder entry to a bank to hear speech of Mary Lou about wizards living among humans and very dangerous to human mankind - meanwhile a cute niffler manage to escape from Newt magic suitcase and runaway into the bank, Newt found out and try to catch it back. His path cross with a no-mag Kowalksi - a wanna be pastries shop owner, then soon the adventure begins for both of them. Then Newt arrested by a demoted auror Tina Goldstein and brings him to magical congress, so she can get promoted again. But, then things don't happen as she hopes. Cause, in the process when Kowalski escape from Newt, their suit case accidentally swapped - all the magical beasts that Newt hide in that magic suitcase escape, even one of that beast bite Kowalski and cause him a fever. And rhe road to a whole new unforgettable adventure begins for all of them. I do admit that i enjoyed this movie - even though that director David Yates buy too much time to bring all adventure that make me in between of bored, curious and impatience at the same time. But, even i never read any of JK Rowling's book i still can feel that this character Graves - is onto something evil (my opinion cause that choose Collin Farrel - that also known of his ability to play as a villain, but it's not a poor choice, cause Farrel really did his part as a cold magical security). Yates succeeded brings this element of curiousity among audiens that never read this JK Rowling book, what is Graves agenda - who is the wanna be quiet introvert Credence? I also enjoyed the hillarious and emotional moments that Yates build between character Newt-Tina-Kowalski and Queenie. Off course the beasts are fantastic. What i feel is that this first Fantastic Beast is not really of Harry Potter's weight, but Yates manage to delivered this in a such magically fun delightful adventure with such beautiful special effects. But really it was Kowalski character that steal moments while the others - not mediocre - even though not fantastic but really fits in. My final conclusion is : \"The whole plots not kick hard enough but...really entertaining\""

But finally the wait is over, and I can feast on this movie with my eyes! And for all you Potterheads out there, I've got some good news! Fantastic Beasts is just what the title says, it is fantastic. The biggest surprise for me was the fact that this movie doesn't rely on nostalgia and just try to set up sequels, but instead it gives us a good story, interesting characters portrayed by fantastic actors and last but not least, it gives us the feeling that we really are in the Harry Potter world once again! There's magic, there's wonder, there's color and an overall feeling of warmth here. Eddie Redmayne was such a good choice for the main role, his performance was fantastic, and so was Dan Fogler's as the funny sidekick character. It's just so nice that the movie didn't suck because I'm the biggest Potterhead and it feels good to have a new movie in the series."

The visual effects are remarkable and the beasts are truly fantastic. On the other hand, the story isn't especially inventive and the direction lacks personality. Even Redmayne resorts to the gawky, awkward style that's often apparent in his work. While there are clever moments and a few mildly enjoyable characters, it's just a noisy, jumbled disarray by the end. The overall effect is visually dazzling and fun to watch, but not especially captivating on a human level."

Shout out to Dan Fogler, He gave a much better performance than I expected and really had a lovable character. I thought Ezra Miller was by far the weakest part of the cast, Mainly due to how his character was written and not acted. Plot wise is was a little bit basic but there was enough action and plot twists to keep you interested in for the full run time. It's a very beautiful and well directed/edited film. I wish they tried more variety among spell use rather than the same 3-4 spells over and over again but that's just me.Overall, I really enjoyed it. I had no real issue with the movie and can't wait to see the second one. Certainly lived up to expectations as a spin off and more than lived up to the hype."

      "text": "For someone that is really into the Harry Potter universe, I was actually kind of excited for this movie. However, the movie was simply enjoyable, but nothing special. I'll start off with some positives. First off, I was intrigued with the concept of having to recapture the beasts. The beasts were very unique and interesting to watch. As much as I personally do not like Eddie Redmayne as an actor, I thought he was fine as Newt Scamander. Nothing special, but serviceable. I really enjoyed Dan Folger as Kowalski, or the no-maj as he's referred to in the movie. I liked seeing him really get caught up in this world and forming this awkward friendship with Newt Scamander. At the same time, I also found his relationship with the character of Queenie to be even more interesting than I could have possibly imagined. Most importantly, despite the movies numerous \"Lord of the Rings\" like endings, what happens to Kowalski at the end of the movie honestly left me touched. However, the movie has quite a bit of flaws. The movie suffers from pacing issues. Some scenes played out better than others. The whole Ezra Miller storyline didn't really captivate me and felt as if it was from a completely different movie. But the biggest reveal in the movie, while truly surprising, didn't feel needed in any way, shape or form. If you've seen the movie, you will definitely know what I am talking about. And the ending itself went on way too damn long. Like I mentioned before, I like what happened with the no-maj character, but everything else happening at the end simply did not need to happen. There were definitely two movies going on at the same time, which was very distracting. At the same time, I cared about our main protagonists and wanted to learn more about them, which is why I ended up enjoying the movie in the long run. Overall, for a messy movie, it still provides some interesting new additions to this movie universe that fans will not be disappointed with. I give \"Fantastic Beasts\" a B-!"

As in Alien and Jaws, less is more. There was too much of it in the film, yet it felt insufficiently explained. This part here could be shortened by few minutes. (Note: There is a less obvious villain in the film.)3) Johnny Depp's casting in this film felt like an attempt to promote his flagging career.How would the the different age groups rate it?Children: (The film is not rated for children.)Teens: ExcellentYoung adults: GoodMedium age adults: GoodOld adults: GoodRating: 4/5 (no half scores).

It has all the magic of the Harry Potter franchise, while at the same time bringing in new elements and standing on its own without relying too much on nostalgia or the previous entries. I don't want to spoil too much but this film was much darker than I was expecting. This is definitely a more mature version of J.K. Rowling's universe. The acting is fantastic. Eddie Redmayne as Newt was a great choice but I would say the standout is probably Colin Farrell as Percival Graves. He stole every scene he was in. Fantastic Beasts is full to the brim with imagination. It truly shows how many tricks Rowling still has up her sleeve. It's pretty impressive how her first screenplay/film is already up to par with her extremely innovative book series. This is definitely not like other prequels when it comes to substance. It's original, it's complex, and it's engaging. And I say that as someone who liked the Star Wars prequels.Unfortunately, since I'm not an official critic, I can only give scores out of 10 but if I could give scores out of 100, this would be a 96. For Harry Potter fans, this probably ranks somewhere in between 3rd and 4th place out of all the films. For me, that'd be between Prisoner of Azkaban and Half-Blood Prince."
