The X-Files: I Want to Believe see's the return of Mulder (Duchovny) and Scully (Anderson) as FBI agents since their last film made in 1998... However this one is made in 2008 by director Chris Carter and I've only seen The X-Files: I Want to Believe once and to be honest I don't remember the story and became confused whilst watching it what was actually going on.

The movie would have benefited from a bigger plot line... a governmental conspiracy or something, but instead decided to take a simple black market approach with a tiny bit of religion mixed in. Reading some of the reviews I anticipated a boring love story between Mulder and Scully, but really their relationship was merely probed in an unusual way in that we skip by the awkward tense unexplored romantic relationship in the TV series and skip right to the sex apparently. Yet, I'm still not sure exactly what their relationship was in the movie. Weird."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I can see everyone's problem with this film. When something carries a cult name like X-Files people expect a certain degree of escapism and adventure as in the first film and this unfortunately hasn't happened here. The film stands quite well individually (if without the X-Files name). Had this been made without the necessary cast and certain personnel this could have easily been passed off as another crime thriller with a couple of character name changes.

It was like they spent 10 years building up an intricate story arc that finally culminated in the series finale, and the first X-files movie even played into that storyline, but then for some reason many years later they just decided to ignore all of that and make a mediocre 'monster of the week' episode into a full movie. And it wasn't just that the movie didn't tie into the main story arc of the television series with the alien invasion and government conspiracies either, but it was that the movie even ignored the many years of character development and the evolution of Mulder and Scully's personalities in favor of just going back to the original scenario where she is a 'skeptic' and he is a 'believer', even though that isn't the way things were at all when the series left off.

I agree with someone else who said that many of the reviewers have only a passing knowledge of the tv show. If they had done their homework, they'd know that this movie pays tribute to the Mulder Scully relationship -- which was the driving force of the show, anyway. I sincerely hope that the movie brings in enough at the box office for Carter to return for a third movie -- he has been saying that the third one will deal with the alien invasion, and it's a resolution that they fans deserve and that a new generation of fans could really latch onto."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "This movie is so inconsistent,boring and the dialouge between scully and mulder just reeks of boredness."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "A fairly good movie, with a decent cast, but not a very powerful story to go with it. overall its worth the watch."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "How was this an X-File?

Why is Sculley using Google to learn about a procedure she's performing the next day? What was the point of the chase into the construction site?If the villian had taken Amanda Peet with him, the scene might have made sense. Can anyone explain why Sculley and Mulder had no chemistry? Is it because we see the moment of intimacy so early? It's almost like Chris Carter didn't expect fans of the TV series to watch the movie."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Only Scully(Gillian Anderson), and Scully alone, can broach the subject of Mulder's sister to the ex-FBI agent. Fearing that Mulder(David Duchovny) may still be feeling the effects of cabin fever, Scully orientates him to the here and now, so when he leaves with the field agents to help locate a missing girl, it doesn't turn into a wild goose chase, conducted on synchronous time. Because Mulder loves Scully, no offense is taken by her implicit suggestion that he possesses an omnipresent mind. And because Scully is probably the most important person in Mulder's life, he lets the obvious go unspoken; that Dana Scully's return to practicing medicine is the act of a tortured soul. Mulder, he knows. He's been there. He's still there. Since \"The X-Files: I Want to Believe\" knows its characters intimately, fans surmise that Dana is seeking the approval of her father, albeit posthmously. In an episode from Season One called \"Beyond the Sea\"(featuring a great performance by Brad Dourif), Scully loses her father, and is aggreived by his unspoken disappointment that her departure from the medical profession in order to join the FBI caused him great consternation. She wants out. She wants to remain in the light. So Mulder goes into the darkness alone, but Scully is his dark light, and Mulder is hers. To quote Michael Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather: Part III(I Want to Recast my Daughter's Part)\", \"Just when I thought that I was out, they pull me back in.\" Thankfully, \"The X-Files: I Want to Believe\" is smaller in scale than the first film. Throughout its nine-year run on the Fox network, we saw enough signs of alien life and government conspiracies. Signs of love, that's what longtime fans want."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Chris Carter did what he knows best, write a good x-files episode.

It's didn't assume the audience was stupid. The only thing I thought was stupid was a medical doctor using Google for stem cell research."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Any way you slice it, this movie is a disaster from top to bottom. The one good part that even the scroogiest of critics point to is Gillian Anderson's performance. Yes, it's fine, but when one is working with such a god-awful script, who cares? The banter is muddled at best, and the plot is a pale imitation of the show's lamest of episodes. But none of that would matter if something -- anything -- worked. Yet it's doesn't. [SPOILER ALERT] Everything, including the chiming of the theme when a picture of George W. Bush is seen outside an FBI conference room (which made me say aloud in the theater, \"Well what the hell did THAT prove?\"), is ham-fisted in a way that makes \"Walker Texas Ranger\" look like first-rate drama. And giving Skinner three lines (the second of which is a repeat of the first) is beyond hokey; why bring Mitch Pileggi back at all if that's all you were going to do? \"I Want To Believe\" doesn't ruin the show's legacy; most of those episodes are still insanely watchable a decade and a half later. But, like the Twin Peaks flick \"Fire Walk With Me,\" though it has the same characters, the writers apparently lost the plot somewhere, and this version is yet another piece that proves \"Star Trek\" was about the only show that was ever able to make the leap from small-screen sci-fi to big-screen action and not totally suck."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "As some user said: It just ruined one of my favourite shows!

I realize the department was shut down, but that doesn't mean paranormal events have stopped happening. If the story revolved around an x-file that happens to threaten a member of the FBI, that could have pushed it up a notch. I'm okay with the fact that it does not involve aliens, but something extraordinary would've helped. or keep this plot, just don't drop \"X-Files\" into the title of the movie . . . it's misleading. great to see mulder and scully again though!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I'm a long-time viewer of the series, and was depressed at seeing the show decline quite a lot after the 1998 film, especially the mythology. The stand-alones never held my interest, except the psychic ones, because I never cared for being scared. The mythology episodes had more to them: there was a depth of complicated, yet sometimes mysterious, relationships between Scully and Mulder and the human conspirators. So, the mythology basically ended brilliantly with Season 6's \"Two Fathers\"/\"One Son\" and Season 7's \"Sein Und Zeit\"/\"Closure\", but the series generally lacked the quality of Seasons 3 and 4, and what really became obvious was that Mulder and Scully's dynamics were stale from Season 6 on; they tried to throw in comedy to give them something new, and there were a few good episodes, which surpassed the over-rated Season 1. However, Season 7 was a total failure, except the afore-mentioned episodes. Though Season 8 added some new dynamics with the introduction of Doggett and a few of the new mythology stories were fun, it wasn't consistent enough, and Doggett often played a more stubborn, working-class Scully. As I wrote in a Season 9 review, \"the characters moved through the dramatic motions in so formulaic a manner, lacking clear motivations, while the stories lacked real plot; scenes and dialogue felt stretched out on purpose. The mythology had become a caricature of itself, employing mystifying dialogue and pointless confrontation to put nothing substantial across, but to serve as ends in themselves.\" So, anything that avoided the formula of Scully and Mulder's dynamics would have been a bonus. How many times would Scully contemplate whether Mulder's quest was hers? How often would Mulder feel guilty about that fact and go off on his own? How often would they suspect Skinner? How often would some physical trauma happen to Scully causing her to feel victimized? How often would the X-Files be closed or Mulder and Scully kicked out of the FBI? More importantly, how often could the themes of faith, trust, and paranoia be used with any freshness? The first film was a failure as a mythology story because it tried to work as a standalone but without all the aspects that made the mythology so effective -- the built-up fascinating characters and their loaded histories with Scully and Mulder and the various theories of what the main characters had seen so far. After the series' best mythology episodes in Season 5's \"Redux II\", \"Patient X\" and \"The Red and the Black\", viewers were greeted with a fairly shallow story. The X-Files was never as much about revelations as about the dramatic interaction of the main characters with the recurring ones like CSM and Krychek, but they were either absent or stripped of any meaningful dialogue. There was also such a self-conscious attempt to dumb things down for excitement purposes: the explosions, the silly bees, the spaceship at the end -- the last of which was never really explained. Granted this film had a pretty lame suspense quotient and misused Callum Keith Rennie, who is magnificent in Battlestar Galactica, and just wasn't very exciting here. Part of this also stemmed from the low key nature of the story. I have to admire how Carter abandoned all the shock and awe of the previous film and shallow copycats like J.J. Abrams, who is just an awful, superficial producer. Mulder and Scully were on the run from the FBI at the end of the series, so to just have them back in with guns and resources would have been pat. The story was trying something new in having them on their own and they had to rely on basic resources like no guns and Google.com. Carter has also often said that real fright comes from the everyday. So, a collision in daylight with a snow-shovelling truck becomes a terrifying abduction. At least that was the idea. I could admire his restraint the same way I did Bryan Singer's attempts to tone down a super hero story in \"Superman Returns\", even though they both failed in some ways. However, for all the lack of thriller action, the movie was really about the relationship between Scully and Mulder, and I was surprised at how fresh the dialogue was and how new the turns in their relationship were, showing how it had grown. Mulder no longer spoke in cheesy stock phrases about how \"the truth is out there\" (something ardent early seasons' fans forget he did a lot in Seasons 1 and 2, when the dialogue was often poor). There was a subtlety to the ever-present themes that rejuvenated them, and my fear they had been tired out was put to rest. Also, Scully was given a dignity she hadn't known in a professional sense before in that she actually kept her job in the end. In addition, there was an attempt at moral complexity in Billy Connelly's character. Finally, the tender moments and the excellent dialogue between Mulder and Scully were wonderful to see, and was really the most important aspect of any X-Files movie I was going to watch. Truthfully, their drama felt more real than the relationship between the two leads in \"Atonement\", although admittedly what made that film great was the outsider sister. Yet, if this had been a film by Anthony Minghella and not The X-Files with lots of superficial critics' stock expectations, it would have gotten better reviews. I'm not saying it's an 'A' film, but what Chris Carter has attempted and succeeded at in the intimate drama and dialogue is quite an accomplishment, especially for a sci fi franchise that built its audience on spooks and scares, and is now not simply using drama as a breather between action scenes like most of Hollywood. 7.5 out of 10"}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Very disappointing.

The whole plot centered around a series of abductions and a so- called- psyhic the FBI was depending on to help them out.

Who was responsible? ....well, I'll just let you figure that one out for yourself.

I didn't see the Scully I knew with short bright red hair. She didn't even have her \"move over. I need answers NOW!\" drive. For the first quarter of the movie, Mulder looks like a mountain man with his beard. Who the HELL are these people? They weren't even in character. Then the movie goes on and on with some perverted weirdo with physic abilities. LAME! No drama. No conspiracy. No X. No nothing. It dragged on so much and was so bad that I kept on fast forwarding the movie. And just when you think something is about to happen to the only person in this movie who is in peril. Scully and Skinner burst in but almost without effort and/or lack of surprise. I lost so much respect that I almost can't watch the X-Files seasons that I own anymore. And they were so good that I was actually afraid to go to bed at night thinking that there's an alien or something in my room.

It was like watching a Rocky film where there were 10 seconds of boxing at the beginning and 10 seconds somewhere in the middle and then everything else was about something completely unrelated.

The plot of the paranormal phenomene was only a gimmick for exploration into the characters and faith, and how to deal with darkness and life. I think that so many reveviewers of movies and television have been somewhat dumbed down by conspicuous melodramatic, viciously obvious or crass movie fare that subtlety, lack of righteousness, personal doubt and struggle, so much the everyday, are beyond their minds. No one seems to want to think, and that is why people are so negative of this rather beautiful tale. The X Files promotes that life is not an area of duality, black or white, but an entire realm of shades of grey that few of us want to admit, because not having a camp where everyone sits to justify our rather horrible tendencies and behaviors toward one another is scary.
