Brutal, sincere and well presented. Very good cast and this movie wasn\u2019t re-colored story as in the case of films of similar subject. It's just a pity that the fight for survive itself was very short."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Daniel Radcliffe still on his way of pushing his career further trying to get rid of his Harry Potter image, let's be honest, he will never do it, but he's doing a good job taking risky roles.Jungle is a film focused on survival, inspired by the memories of Israeli explorer Yossi Ghinsberg who was stranded in an unexplored part of the Bolivian Amazonian jungle in 1981.Jungle is directed by Greg McLean, a director more focused on terror, he's the director of Wolf Creek 1 and 2 and the recent The Belko Experiment, although Jungle is more focused on other topics, the tonal and structural aspect of the film follows much of the rules of his previous films.His direction is neat and successful but keeps everything in the grounds he knows, certain narrative points feel irregular and certain sequences will test your patience.Radcliffe is solid, he carries with fluency and credibility the protagonism but in the end the role does not seem to require more of him from what he already delivered in Swiss Army Man.Forgettable, but it has enough quality to stand out a bit."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Jungle tells the real survival story of 3 young men who wants to add some action and excitement to their lives by thinking \"What if we die this time for a change?\" and heading to the jungles of Bolivia. The difficulties experienced and the delusions seen by Yossi, who is played by Daniel Radcliffe, are illustrated successfully. If you are into survival movies, I think you're gonna love this one."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "A director for horror movies takes a stab at making a survival film that's based on a true story. It's a well put together movie on the surface, but there's nothing going on underneath. Yossi is never given any room to become anything more than a faceless guy who got lost in the jungle. The stuff that happens to him is surprisingly tame compared to other films of the like out there. I get that the slower pace is probably more realistic, but despite Greg McLean's penchant for horror it's the more brutal things that actually happened to Yossi that failed to make the cut here. The presence of McLean's previous filmmaking experiences can be felt here. The soundtrack and trippy hallucination sequences feel ripped straight from a horror flick, and are among the movie's more interesting elements. One particularly grotesque moment in the movie is brought to life by some impressive gore that is not for the eyes of the squeamish or those with a fear of parasites. There is something inherently watchable about a person surviving by themselves in the unforgiving world of nature we so often avoid. While some of that still shines through here, \"Jungle\" never manages to transcend to anything beyond just watchable. The shiny exterior can't make up for the hollow interior. It's missing that uplifting element one can feel when witnessing a story about a man overcoming the odds and surviving by finding that very special, very human driving force for life that exists within all of us, but is found by so few. Daniel Radcliffe is all there really is. It's impressive just how much that means though. The incredibly talented and likable actor carries things much further than they otherwise would have gone."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Has some strong moments but is ultimately a quite poorly-executed survival story."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Good movie 8/10 Good movie 8/10 Good movie 8/10 Good movie 8/10 Good movie 8/10 Good movie 8/10"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Jungle, is not a place for humans anymore as thousands of years ago!A much better, in fact, one of the best biopic about the survival in the wilderness. It is an Australian film about a young Israeli named Yossi, who went for a trekking in the Bolivian jungle with three others, but had got lost and fought for survival. It's 1981, the rainy season is just a corner away, but the four went to find a lost Indian village. After everybody got separated, the remain story told from Yossi's perspective, how he faced the nature's challenges to keep alive and make safely to the human civilisation.The film was very good compared to what the trailer and teaser hinted out. Radcliffe is getting better with his every new film. With performance like this, surely everybody would accept him in the coming days. So we could see him in big projects, in big roles. Good writing and direction, but it was based on the biographical book of the same name. The film was entirely shot in Australia, but you can witness the real South American atmosphere. Something what bothered me was, Yossi an ex army man, so this kind of survival skills is taught in the army camps, yet he was scared and struggle like a normal person. Overall, it is a good film to go for it.8/10"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Before the movie I had no idea about the real story behind it. Big plus for keeping script as close to the events as possible. \"Jungle\" is a very well shot showing beauty and also danger of surrounding nature. Plus great performance by Daniel Radcliffe and other cast members. Definitely one of the better man vs nature movies of recent years."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Why this brilliant piece of work gone underrated.
