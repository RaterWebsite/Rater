In it, our hero, Chris Kyle played by Bradley Cooper is presented as a young man growing up in Texas and we see that his girlfriend is cheating on him. Later, he meets his beautiful wife played by Sienna Miller in a bar. We see Chris Kyle react to the September 11th attacks and he enlists in the military to fight terrorists in the middle east. Kyle is deployed in Iraq and we see his escapades as the most deadly sniper in the U.S. military. Iraq had been listed as a State sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. since 1990, when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. Iraq had also been on the list from 1979 to 1982; it was removed so that the U.S. could provide material support to Iraq in its war with Iran. Hussein's regime had proven to be a problem for the UN and Iraq's neighbors due to its use of chemical weapons against Iranians and Kurds in the 1980s. The Iraq War began in March 2003 with an air campaign, which was immediately followed by a U.S.-led ground invasion. The Bush administration cited UNSC Resolution 1441, which warned of \"serious consequences\" for violations such as Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction. The Bush administration also stated the Iraq war was part of the War on Terror, as Saddam Hussein was a radical Sunni muslim, leader of the Baathist party who may have had ties to Al-Queda. The movie is gripping, and you're pulling for Kyle who is tough and gallant. One criticism I have of the movie is it doesn't show many airstrikes, it only features one in the entire movie, when I know we bombed the hell out of Iraq. But it wants to focus on the sniping on the ground so its acceptable. The movie can get pretty exciting and intense. There are some cool action sequences with American marines going up against terrorists. The movie does a good job depicting PTSD caused by the trauma of war, as Kyle has to deal with these problems after his exploits in the middle east. There is a well-directed scene at a barbeque where Kyle freaks out with a dog and it disturbs his wife. The movie ends tragically, as we are told Chris Kyle is killed by a mentally disturbed veteran he was trying to help. Overall, a good tribute to an American although controversial, was virtuous and a hero."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "This is not it guys. I'm sorry but I have to be very negative. I realize some can't stand any negativity, so I ask you to read this at your own discretion.\r Let's begin with the movie. No spoilers. Just let me say it wasn't much better than the usual straight-to-TV movie. The budget was somewhat higher, but this is where the good stuff pretty much ends. Don't expect awesome sniper-stuff or anything like that. In fact, the little bit you saw was utter nonsense. I served myself and I can tell you, not even regular troops were like that; very unrealistic and unprofessional. You get to look through the scope, so let me tell you it's a made up nonsensical thing they came up with.\r This movie is a drama first and foremost. It's about the inner person of Chris Kyle, his partner, his life. As mentioned before, none of it was done right, convincingly nor was I moved to care.\r The movie is based on a book of a soldier who's known to 'shoot first, ask questions later'. This is what his comrades said. This makes the 200 kills suspicious from the get-go. Needless to say that his colleagues put this carefully in the media and anonymous. And needless to say that the main stream media didn't pursue this angle.\r Chris Kyle is the same person who needed to ridicule Jesse Ventura in his book. He supposedly floored Ventura. Ventura sued the Kyle estate and won the case. What's interesting is that no SEAL witness could produce a consistent story even though they were there. This angered the Jury, as they explained in the media, and hence allowed Ventura to win the case.\r They (the anti-Ventura SEALS) subsequently complained in the media that 'what happens inside should stay inside'. It supposedly is a unwritten SEAL code (clich\u00e9 clich\u00e9). But none of them was consistent enough to mention that Kyle ignored that very same rule! In fact, he ridiculed an ex-colleague in a commercial and publicly available book. How is that for double standards? Even though Ventura won the case, he is practically out of job since then.\r American Sniper is the same guy who bragged about shooting looters after Katrina. I'm sorry but bragging about it is not right.\r I'm aware of the popularity of the SEALs around the globe. But because of their policy to be visible in the media (they made that choice few years ago), their ugly side shines through as well. Too often they communicate and behave like stereotypes who use too much anabolics.\r Thank you and see you next time!"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "It just feels to me that the movie should of been better.

But I have to say something about this movie.\r This movie is a war propaganda movie. If you think showing dead bodies with blood and having one character against war itself is considered enough an anti-war movie, then I am afraid you\u2019re wrong. I believe that the director of the movie Clint Eastwood is an anti-war person despite being a Republican and he tries to deliver his anti-war message to the audience. But when the message is lost in the audience and instead encourages more war and Islamphobia, then I am afraid his so-called anti-war message is not delivered clearly.\r Speaking of Clint Eastwood, his direction in this movie is okay. I have seen far better directing on war movies.\r The characters in the movie are utterly unlikable and uninteresting. The main character Chris Kyle is really hard to sympathize and relate to especially that the Chris Kyle in real life turns out to be a huge dick. Despite that, Bradley Cooper delivers a really good performance that it\u2019s almost uncanny to the real Chris Kyle.\r Not all movies based on a real person has to be accurate but when this movie made Chris Kyle a hero with little to no flaws when he is a huge dick in real life like I said earlier, that kind of inaccuracy is unfair and biased.\r The only parts I liked about this movie was how Chris Kyle dealt with his PTSD and it felt realistic without being over the top. However I feel like these scenes were underdeveloped and I needed more of him struggling with his PTSD.\r Lastly, I don\u2019t think this movie is worthy a Best Picture nomination for this year\u2019s Oscars. It\u2019s just another war movie that brings up nothing new to the table. It\u2019s just overrated in Oscar terms for me.\r American Sniper is not a movie for everyone and in my opinion it\u2019s very overrated.

It is also blatant propaganda for the USA - this wouldn't have looked out of place in Nazi Germany or North Korea, yet bizarrely it doesn't even do that right as the whole think makes the protagonist look like a complete maniac. Perhaps that's what Eastwood was going for - the maniac who was green lighted due to patriotic fervor or something - but the movie doesn't communicate that point well at all.

The first thing it does as portray the Iraqis as the bad guys who are responsible for 9/11 despite them having nothing to do with 9/11. The 2nd thing this movie does wrong is paint Chris Kyle as a conflicted soldier, where if you read his book he actually was not very remorseful about the people he killed. I mean lets be real here, Chris Kyle was an absolutely terrible person. I'll go even as far to say he was a psychopath, he said it himself that he loved killing and that he would kill anyone with a kuron which is what basically everyone wears over there. Kyle was no hero, he was a monster, a repulsive and sick man who was a pathological liar that forged his military accomplishments and kill count to sell books.

The performances are excellent, both Cooper and Miller are dynamic and believable in their roles.

The moral subtext is where criticism is warranted as this is a film which posits the hero as a representative of the entire conflict in Iraq and, as such, any commentary on the nature of war or that particular conflict is decidedly one-dimensional. This may be expected from an Eastwood film, however, it's clear that not only is the moral quandry not central to the plot, it is also treated with disdain in the dialogue, which may play well for an American audience, but smacks of the 'MURICA mentality rather than good storytelling.

Other specs ops in the SEAL family have also made similar comments.\r This is not Saving Private Ryan where there, the battle scenes were extremly realistic and quite accurate to the real D-Day event, most of the inconsistencies lie within the names of people in the movie as well as names of battles and cities.

Various postulates as to its success have been formulated: its belated offering of Iraq War cartharsis or even justification; its tight filtering of historical events through a single, largely sympathetic protagonist (memorably played by Bradley Cooper); or simply a highly effective publicity campaign. My own suspicion is that the film is fundamentally about war-themed video games \u2013 or rather, is a successful attempt to capitalize on those games\u2019 colossal popularity.\rThat the film\u2019s iconography, sensibility and rhythm are at one with such games is too obvious to require comment: even I\u2019ve played enough to know that. But I think that part of what the film does is convince its audience that playing those games is actually a form of civic participation, requiring concentration, commitment and self-sacrifice.\rClint lets the cat out of the bag near the end of the film, when Chris Kyle\u2019s kids are playing some game or other (\u201cLevel 4, daddy!\u201d), but I think it\u2019s best to read the atavistic scenes of \u201chunting\u201d in the film as figures for the perceptual (and political) pedagogy offered by war-video games. In other words, what the film does is construct one of those good ol\u2019 four-level allegories familiar from medieval times, enabling the private wargames-player (the \u201cmoral\u201d level) to insert him/herself into the \u201clegend\u201d of Chris Kyle (the \u201ctypological\u201d level), and thereby connect to the larger destiny of the imperial nation as such (the \u201canagogical\u201d level). The \u201cliteral\u201d level, the history of the Iraq conflict, serves as nothing more than material for these figurations, to be arranged and rearranged like the body parts in the torture chamber.\rThe point of doing this, of course, is to siphon off some of the enormous libidinal/capital investment in such games - the film is doing huge business! - by providing a gratifying political emplotment of that investment (as a form of civic commitment). After all, you can even jeopardize your precious family life if you spend too much time trying to defeat the (computerized or \u201csavage\u201d) enemy: yet despite these existential risks, the vindication will come, draped in the flag, somewhere down the road\u2026."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "An appalling attempt at movie-making.

While Bradley Cooper nails the role, the mostly boring war sequences consumes too much of the movie."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "While not for the faint hearted, the often harrowing \"American Sniper\" is a solid if not spectacular war epic by Clint Eastwood. It is well acted by its leads and delivers a tense tribute to the late American sniper, Chris Kyle."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "American Sniper has its moments (for me, it was the sandstorm scene), but the film didn't quite take off. Maybe it was the constant back and forth from home to warzone, or the overused \"soldier and his wife\" drama, or the lack of empathy for the protagonist, I don't know. I don't think Bradley Cooper had the right face for his character, even though he acts just fine throughout.\r A major lack of detail lets itself known, also: where's the score, where's the cinematography?"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This is a movie with a lot of idiots saying this and that about it. Simply it's intense, inspiring, and sad. Throughout Chris's life he had tragedies. From his friends to himself. There has been speculation that Kyle was more of a **** than the movie shows. This might be true but he still shrived to help his fellow marines and fellow people out. He said that he loved killing the enemy. I don't mind this because....they were the enemy. Like he said, he will stand proud and answer to every shot he took to his creator. The ending is where it left our theater silent. You could hear a pin drop because people didn't expect something like that.\rThe best part is Cooper's performance. From Hangover to this, Bradley has completely revamped his career. Another great part of this was story, it just kept you engaged and the dialgogue was on point. The amazing part of this is...it's all real. These men went through this as they tried to fight for out freedoms. Give them respect that they deserved. For all the evil, it was done by people who told them to do it. He had unstoppable power to get the job done and protect those he loved the most. Overall it's the best or one of the best movies to this early 2015. 9.3."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "The lack of historical accuracy wore down my enjoyment of this film after a couple of days. Eastwood has The right to present any view of the war he wants to. However to imply that Iraq attacked us, do not tell that IRAQ is Sunni, Shia, and other, to imply to al-Qaeda in Iraq was there from the beginning, to act as if we won the war, the military had few doubts, etc is a disservice to our troops and to our the viewing audience in the long run.I applaud him for show the damage that a bullet to the head will do but to paint the war so simplistically is a major flaw. Did Dick Cheney write the script? No one will remember this revisionist nonsense in a few years."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "A movie with very little character development or point of view. Forget the moral ambiguity of this stupid war, nobody really changes in this movie. Fake baby, whining 'wife', and war 'buddies' who talk about their personal lives right before they get shot.  Cooper, acts through chewing tobacco (and does quite well with what little he has to work with).  Oh yeah, and dark haired 'bad guys'. I'd play Call of Duty before spending money on this movie."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Normally I really like Eastwood's films and normally I really like war movies, but this one is really stupid.  Sadly you get the feeling the sole purpose is propaganda for the US war machine. There is no real dealing with the problems Kyle encounters back home."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "absolutely the best movie of the year, the depth that Eastwood and Cooper nail the looks and feel of being deployed.  The feeling of not being over there and helping, with people you will grow closer to than even those in your family, is really captured in Coopers face while sitting at the VA.  It became really hard to hold back the tears during the credits as they showed the love and support that Chief Kyle received after his passing.  Best movie winner, hands down."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "It's not enough merely to observe that this is a right-wing propaganda movie. It's also a bad movie. It IS possible to make propaganda movies that work as movies even for viewers who don't agree with the viewpoint. Case in point: The original \"Red Dawn.\" The makers of Red Dawn really did believe that America was vulnerable to being invaded and conquered by Soviet Russia. Even though the premise of Red Dawn was and is laughable, the Wolverines were people you could root for and the movie worked.\r As to American Sniper, for me the picture was one-dimensional, the plot simple and wholly predictable."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Bradley Cooper made this film somewhat acceptable, however it boils down to another American propaganda piece.\r It's a pity there wasn't much point to the film in the end and all the subtext was the usual \"America, greatest country in the world\" crap."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "There were a few moments that were spectacular, but those moments couldn't save the rest of the movie. The undercurrent of glorifying war also left a pretty bad after taste. A movie should never be used as a propaganda tool, and even if it wasn't done with that in mind, this movie definitely comes across that way. If you simply must watch this movie, I'd recommend watching Blackhawk down instead"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "American Sniper is a standard \"meh\" movie with an over hyped buzz because its director,  cast and subject, as its main target audience is like \"I love me a gun\" and the over ego feeling of \"I love me a supposedly American hero who kills them all\".\r\"American Sniper\" valorizes,  guns, father teaching a son to use the gun and kill,  muslim's xenophobia and arrogance not Altruism as heroism.\rIn a time where children are killing children in schools; in name of God terrorists are killing innocents around the world and a huge part of the humanity is being named terrorist just because its religion and the religious xenophobia around the world is  gaining more space in society and it is so wrong.. This movie timing is awful.\rArt for the masses has not to be historically accurate but \"American Sniper\" is so lame & socially irresponsible, domestically & worldwide for all reasons above.\rSorry.... But in my POV. You can't say that the art from a genius filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl, who did institutional movies for the German nazista govern, was historical wrong and the meh movie from Clint Eastwood is not. Guarded the proportion, it is the same...\rArt is art,  but the industry has to have the responsibility of the time that a piece of art is out there. World is in the middle of a social  mess (the last months and weeks have dozens of examples) and this movie just brings a bad image for Americans around the world. The American people doesn't deserves it. They are suffering with it."}], "recommendations": ["the_hurt_locker", "lone_survivor", "munich", "fury", "letters_from_iwo_jima", "green_zone", "lord_of_war", "12_strong", "13_hours_the_secret_soldiers_of_benghazi", "free_state_of_jones", "zero_dark_thirty", "machine_gun_preacher", "jarhead", "valkyrie", "apocalypse_now", "cartel_land", "apocalypto", "exodus_gods_and_kings", "red_tails", "detroit", "united_93", "the_1517_to_paris", "hostiles", "blackkklansman", "the_kingdom"]}
