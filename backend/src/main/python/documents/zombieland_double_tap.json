      "text": "After a hiatus of 10 years, the original director, 2 writers and the main cast are all back, but the thrill is gone. Even though the chemistry is still there and there are plenty of snarky comments, the magic is missing. Primarily, because the action takes a back seat to relationships (yawn). The main quartet splits up several times, as they cope with new breeds of zombies and their own personal issues. Some fresh faces pop up, but Thomas Middleditch is the only one who adds any fun. There aren\u2019t even many fight scenes and most of the killings aren't clever or original. Don't get me wrong, I love a good zombie chop, but \"The Walking Dead\" does a lot better job of that. My review of the first movie called it \"pure popcorn pleasure,\" but this one rates as a high-spirited but ultimately tired retread. NOTE: Stay thru the credits for an additional gag."

      "text": "Zombieland from 2009 is a good movie that is thoroughly entertaining. So how does the sequel stand up to the original. Eh, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s entertaining but you will probably forget about it after you see it. The film unfortunately feels way too familiar to the first to the point where you feel like it\u2019s almost a copy of the original which is unfortunate because there are some interesting new elements that they added to the film. One of those elements would be the zombie types. It\u2019s a cool idea but it doesn\u2019t go anywhere. There are two moments with the zombie types that are pretty funny but that\u2019s about it. I liked Luke Wilson and Thomas Middleditch\u2019s characters but they are only there for about 5 minutes and then they are gone. Those two are the only new characters I enjoyed. I found Zoey Deutch\u2019s character to be incredibly annoying. I know that\u2019s what the film was going for but she was just way too annoying. The humor was hit or miss for me. I found some of the jokes to be pretty funny while others I thought were terrible. The first Zombieland was definitely much funnier but this film does have a hilarious post credit scene with a celebrity. The one aspect that holds this film up high would be the acting and chemistry between Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin. Just from their performance and chemistry alone, you can tell that they really wanted to make this sequel. Double Tap definitely feels like a Zombieland movie even if it\u2019s a tad bit familiar. As I said earlier, 50 percent of the jokes are pretty funny. They have a segment that comes into play 2 or 3 times called Zombie Kill of the Year that is hilarious. Some of the segments in the film are really good. The opening sequence is brilliant. It\u2019s the main characters battling zombies in front of The White House with Metallica\u2019s Master of Puppets playing and it\u2019s fantastic. Another segment would be a zombie attack scene in an Elvis themed hotel. It\u2019s not a one shot take but it\u2019s made to look like one but it\u2019s great and creative which is definitely what the film needed. Double Tap is much more gory than its 2009 counterpart which is used for mostly comedic value which works most of the time. Overall, Zombieland: Double Tap has great acting and chemistry from the leads and some hilarious moments but it is a little too familiar to its 2009 counterpart and is mostly forgettable. I give Zombieland: Double Tap a 6/10."

Conversely, new viewers may not laugh too often, but rather enjoy the story and the adventures and characters."

      "text": "Zombieland double tap review:10 years after one of the greatest comedic actors of our time was both mistaken for a zombie and shot dead, zombieland double tap delivers an averagely funny but slightly messy experience that feeds off of forced humor and references to the first film. 2009s Zombieland is perhaps one of if not my favorite zombie movies of all time, featuring hilarious performances from the likes of Woody Harrelson and Emma stone, but unfortunately the sequel doesn\u2019t really live up to the hype. It has a lot of laugh out loud moments, but doesn\u2019t manage to capture the essence of what made the first film so great which was the dynamic between such contrasting characters who were completely unfamiliar with one another. Sure they brought back many recognizable features of the original, such as a new version of zombie kill of the week and several reused lines, but it ultimately feels unoriginal compared to its vastly superior predecessor. There were other gaping flaws in the film, for example; right off the bat we are introduced to three new types of zombies who are each given their own introductions. Usually when these things happen in movies they serve a purpose, such as there being a scene later on in the film where the protagonists encounter these specimen, yet two of these three zombies are never again referenced for the rest of the movie. Another issue I had was with the new character Madison. The only reason she existed in this film was to introduce another style of humor, which is making fun of complete stupidity and it annoyed the hell out of me! This movie really suffers from that familiar sequel problem. It doesn\u2019t live up to the original, not only because the original was so great, but because it feels like the whole film just didn\u2019t need to happen. Aside from my many gripes with zombieland 2, the film isn\u2019t bad and is certainly entertaining. You\u2019ll never feel bored and it\u2019s still very enjoyable throughout, and because of this I give it a 5/10"

Within the first 5 minutes I can tell that the humor hasn't matured a bit, like I'm cool with immature humor but this stuff was just like fart jokes and on the same level as \"attack helicopter\" jokes. I tapped out about 20 minutes after Madison was introduced, the last thing this movie needed was the most annoying valley girl type character to do exactly what you'd expect her to do. It was sad to watch, and now it makes me question if the first zombieland was even good in the first place..."

And while it does have its enjoyable moments and throwbacks to the first, I simply found myself a little more underwhelmed by it than I anticipated. Maybe my expectations were a bit too high and I expected it to be slightly funnier, but I also felt as though the risks/stakes weren't as high in this one. Certain scenes/jokes also felt drawn out a little too much, and I was surprised at certain running gags from the first that didn't make it into this one (not a single mention of Tallahassee's love for Twinkies in this one.) On the plus side though, the four main actors all work great together once again, with some new funny additions and a cameo or two here and there that's pretty fun too (stick around till the very end of the credits to see what I mean.) Overall, it didn't quite live up to the first film for me, as it lacks a whole lot of new ideas and feels pretty straightforward, but if your nostalgia level from the first is pretty high, it should satisfy for the most part (seriously though, I hope I'm not the only one that's disappointed with the absence of the Twinkie joke with Woody Harrelson from the first film, cause I thought that was one of the funnier aspects of the first film!)"

I see that critics are not giving this nearly the same praise as the first, and why should they. BUT.... with that said, this is no ordinary sequel.  Double Tap has a certain satirical self-awareness that yes, it is a sequel, and kinda spoofs all the proper tropes and gags.  This is a film with no ulterior motives other than to keep giving what the audience of the first film would want. That would be zombie killing, quotability and great pop culture ref gags.  Zombieland Double Tap is a sequel yes... but it's not one that diminishes the work proceeding.  I'll go a notch higher with this forgiveness in mind and call it 7/10.  Woody always delivers.  And I must admit, there are a few LOLs to be had. It's a sequel that works, and works well.  With that said, if you're looking for something heady or thinky.... you're in the wrong place.

      "text": "Zombieland: Double Tap is directed by Ruben Fleischer, same director of the first movie, and written by Dave Callaham, Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, And starring Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin.Zombieland: Double Tap takes place a decade after the first one, and in the sequel the four slayers must face off against the many new kinds of zombies that have evolved since the first movie, as well as some new human survivors. But most of all, they have to face the growing pains of their own snarky, makeshift family.Zombieland was a great movie, I think it's one of the best zombie-comedies, it was really funny, and well-crafted with amazing performances and great cameos!Zland: Double Tap is another fun movie to add to the first one, it's still funny, charismatic, has good cameos and some cool zombie-sequences.The performances are great, everyone gave a great performance, all the new characters are welcome, but Breslin on the other hand isn't that good as she was in the first one, she's by far my least favorite part of this movie, I think she did a bad job in this movie, but fortunately she doesn't have lots of scenes as she did in the first one.Madison's character, played by Zoey Deutch, is that dumb character that could annoy some people, she's so cliched, but still she has some fine laughs during the movie, but most of her screen-time, I couldn't help it, I was so annoyed of her character.This movie is as simple as the first one was, and that's really good, because what made the first so one a cult classic, is that it wasn't serious nor grim, it was simple, funny and violent... The plot, which is a subplot in other movies, is delightful, it was really good to see them all reunited again on the big screen!Woody Harrelson is once again the MVP of this movie, just like how he was in the first movie, he's so funny and his character is still the one that has depth, even if it's lower than what we saw in the first one, but it's still so good to see that character again, and to see how they developed him, because sadly, there isn't that much of development in this movie over the first one when it comes to characters, there's even another runaway from the same characters, but I loved what they did to Tallahassee, and I'm so happy to see more of him!Fleischer did another great job directing this movie, he made some cool shots, for instance, there's a shot when a couple of moneybags were shot, and money started to flew in the air, and the character just passed beside it and didn't care, because it's Zombieland, what could money do to them? I think he really did a great job capturing this apocalyptic world, just like how he did in the first movie.There isn't really that much to say about a movie like this, it's just a zombie-comedy movie, and it did that really well, but it's not as cohesive as the first one, nor as good as it was, but still really enjoyable!The reason why the first one works better than this one is that the first one wasn't that much about zombies, they were there, but the movie focused more on our 4 main characters, and showed us how they're acting during those situations, this one here, cared more about zombies, and it gave them more character than what we needed.When it comes to flaws, beside the stuff I said above, I think it's not as sick, weird or silly as the first one was, it got a little bit self-aware, and that's not what we wanted to see from a zombie-comedy.Still Zombieland: Double Tap is a an enjoyable movie, if you liked the first one you would probably enjoy yourself in this one too, even though I would watch the first one over this one.I'm gonna give Zombieland: Double Tap a B.Thank you, guys as always for reading my reviews, and if you liked this, you can click on my name up above and see all of my reviews."

      "text": "Wonderful movie overall! The characters really expressed themselves in this movie and expanded their relationship. So much deeper meaning in this movie than people perceive it to be. For example the lack of Twinkie\u2019s on this movie refers to Tallahassee  finding his true family in Z-Land. Along with his constant hate for vans also is a reference from the first film to when he expressed his anger. One more interpretation I picked up on was his despise for the pacifists is due to the loss of his family from the apocalypse. The only way he can express his emotion is through violence. Just something to think about but definitely a movie to enjoy!"
