      "text": "Tim Burton does an honourable job and taking Sondheim's show and putting it on film. The lighting, sets and make-up paint the screen well however, his choice in casting missed the mark. Depp was too small in stature to play Todd and his voice was no match for Sondheim's score when he sang in his upper register. Bonham Carter spent most of her time looking beautiful (a beautiful Mrs. Lovette?!) and lacked the timing and punctuation needed to get all of the laughs from her songs. The extra scenes that were written into the movie were superfluous but the movie still entertained. It was the youngest three lesser known actors who delivered the vocals the way they were meant to be. I plan to be the first in line to get the DVD."

Some people have actual complaints about the music, which i have no problem with. It's just when people give it 0 siting \"it's a musical lol so it must sucks obviously\". I thought the music was brilliant. I felt that Anthony was a bit weak in the long run. A few too many mushy glazed leers into the middle-distance. I thought everyone else did their job well. Good music, good singing, good entertainment. Some excellent suspense work, as well as lots of (thematically justified) blood. I was gripped after 5 minutes. Good stuff all round."

But as for those brilliant reviewers who say they hate the movie and list \"boring boring boring\" or eloquently complain that \"nobody dance\" during the movie, they're not really giving much detail. -I like the movie because the plot was simple and compelling, the idea of the two lovers who can't be together (Depp's character and the woman he loved), but twisted around slightly by echoing them in a younger generation of lovers who have hope of happiness. I thought the visual style was excellent, and here's an EXAMPLE (people need to give more of these): the moment when Depp's character gets his box of barber-knives back and holds one up to his face, and you see his mad, twisted reflection in the clear silver of the blade, and he says that his arms is once again complete. Anyone want to argue that Burton's directing or Depp's acting or the script was off during that moment? London was also grim and beautifully depicted, as fits the whole Industrial Revolution look of it. -The music was fantastic and the singing was much better than I thought it would be (people tended to cringe when the first line of the movie was sung, but then they started getting into it). -Acting was great, especially Depp and Rickman. My only problem was the ending was rushed and flawed, since we don't really get any info on the young lovers. -Good movie; watch it, then judge it."

For once, we get a movie that's quality, that's creative. It's a remake of a play and it shows. I think with all the effort put through this , some people (COUGH PHIL.D COUGH) should have more consideration. Instead of hating the movie just because it's made by Tim Burton, you should try actually watching it. I am a musician and I would say that the camera play was dead-on with the music. It always FIT it was always where it should be. Timing things such as gestures to every beat made it all the more interesting as a musical comedy. The plot was simply revenge involving Judge Turpin and Benjamin (AKA Sweeney Todd) Barker, played by J-Depp. Johnny Depp is a brilliant actor, as Tim Burton said it, the actors weren't meant to be full of life in their movements, because that's what the make-up was for. How contradictory would it be for a \"cold, bitter man\" to play \"lively musical dancer\", do you think? The singing I wouldn't find anything \"embarrassing\" into as some have said. Johnny Depp didn't strike a note wrong and he was singing very well. Everything playing in that movie I found catchy and it's really cruel to pretend that it's nothing but scrap heap. There was TREMENDOUS effort put through this by the actors and the crew. There aren't bad movies: Just bad audiences."

It's visually beautiful, the orchestration is magnificent, the acting is fairly good, and the singing really grew on me, especially now that I see it set against the characters in motion. \"Pretty Women\" still bugged me the way it always did in the stage show, but I was surprised that Anthony's \"Johanna\" solo didn't bug me at all since they trimmed it down, I think. I had some issues with it, but I don't think its faults are big enough to really knock off any points with me, personally. Especially after seeing it multiple times, the things that bugged me the first time don't really bug me much at all anymore. Go see it, everyone!"

It's not the blood itself; it's the blood in juxtaposition with song, and that is a combination audiences have never seen before. \"Sweeney Todd\" is unbelievably violent. The filmmaker miraculously finds the right tone for all those slit throats that fall somewhere between graphic and whimsical. Johnny Depp(imagine Nick Cave) and Helena Bonham Carter(imagine Siouxsie Sioux) are brilliant as Sweeney Todd and Mrs. Lovett. They're sociopaths. They don't have an ounce of good in them. The filmmaker had the guts to make both leads completely ruthless and evil. \"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\" accomplishes the unthinkable; it's a guy's night out musical."

      "text": "Visually stunning. Burton does more for black dark hued films than most black and white movies. The singing is a bit thin. Both Depp and Helena Boham Carter have comparatively quiet voices. They make up for it with their acting. If you loved the musical you will love the movie. Audience unfamiliar with SWT may find the movie quite a shock. The movie is awash with spurting arterial blood. But then thats what you would expect. The audience we saw the film murmured a lot at the end of the picture. Actually listening to the soundtrack at home after the movie, proved richer. Theater sound systems are built more to deal with explosions and dialogue. So I think the recording does a better job at capturing music. What impressed me about the film was how I understood every lyric sung in the musical dialogue. I heard lyrics much clearer than I have often heard in live theatre. If you like Sweeney Todd the musical...I can't imagine you won't like the movie."

The Harkins viewing was awful--the speakers couldn't handle the higher register so Carter sounded tinny & horrible. Either the film print was bad or the projector bulb weak, but the color was completely desaturated as well. Many times characters were half lost in the shadows. It was very close to a Drive in experience--which makes me wonder if those who did not enjoy the movie saw it under conditions ala Harkins."

What I really want to know is what possessed Sir Malcom Arnold in the late 1970's to think \"Hey! This horror story would make a great musical!\". This was the weirdest and most disturbing musical I have ever seen, but I guess since it's a remake of a Broadway musical it is true to its roots. +10 for Tim Burton having the guts to release Sweeney Todd as a movie. The acting and singing was superb. I'm not sure I ever want to see it again because it is so gory and violent, but it is what it is. BTW: Interesting fact: Johnny Depp was absolutely horrified when he read the script. Because of all of the violence and cannibalism in it? -- Nope. Because for the first few minutes of the film he would have to play a \"normal person\" - OH THE HORROR!!!! LOL"

The costumes are superb, the cinematography is beautiful, and yes, everyone can sing. Johnny Depp, who is always interesting, does what became an Oscar-nominated performance in the title role. It's a reminder that when he is on his game, it's a fabulous ride. This movie is based upon the Stephen Sondheim award-winning musical but is much shorter and the humor is trimmed as well, making this a melodrama instead of a comedy. But, it's still highly entertaining and I would recommend getting a little familiar with the lyrics to the songs before watching because it just makes watching better. Sweeney Todd was Benjamin Barker, a young man with a beautiful family, who is torn apart from them by a lecherous judge, played with appropriate sliminess by Alan Rickman. The New York Times opera critic gave Depp high marks and I think was hoping for more from Helena Bonham Carter (Mrs. Lovett), but she does well enough and shines in songs like A Little Priest, By the Sea,  and Not While I'm Around. I do have to admit that I am not a fan of movie musicals, but this one is the exception. One of Tim Burton's best, right up there with Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood."

His 'unique visual style' is totally stagnant, he really hasn't got much feeling for pace or character or timing. He's just 'quirky', and his quirks are getting old really fast. I've seen more captivating insights into the nature of man during my little brothers christmas pageants. I can put up with one or two godawful pieces of trash, but Sweeny Todd has confirmed my suspicions that Burton is clueless. The less said about the singing the better. Depp, frankly, is embarrassing. The songs themselves are totally forgettable, and not at all funny. The plot is predictable. Remarkably, the minor characters are the only redeeming feature in this disaster. Old what's-his-name, the short fat guy with the top hat - I liked him. Also, young so-and-so, the one who rescued what's-her-name from wherever. He was intriguing. Carter, too, was excellent as usual. Throw in the towel Burton. Your time is up! ps If anyone starts oozing about what a genius Burton is I want to point out that you are probably still delirious from the poisonous garbage he's been shoveling down your throat and are incapable of judgment.
