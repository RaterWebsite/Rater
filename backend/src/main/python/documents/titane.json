I love nudity. I love cars. I love murder. I love women. But not this way. There is nothing sexy about this. Not interesting or memorable. And the murder was strictly amateur. It's competently made and acted . And I guess it's going for different or shocking. But the level of sophistication is like a 90s movie. It could have been more over the top.

      "text": "While this utterly out-there cinematic fiasco may do a fine job at generating shock value (though schlock value would probably be more fitting), there's nothing otherwise redeeming about this exercise in pointless, pretentious crap. With a story line that's all over the map, virtually nonexistent character development and almost no resolution to any of its diverse narrative threads, this truly is a case of there being \"no there, there.\" Those who erroneously try to characterize this garbage as high art will likely rationalize away the complete lack of a coherent story or meaningful insights as \"unimportant,\" but that's just far too convenient an excuse to justify the validity and viability of this nonsensical trash. Its stunningly odd mix of slasher film elements, cheesy sexual gratuitousness and bizarre horror film tropes just doesn't cut it, particularly when it's further enhanced by such peculiarities as a sexually ambiguous fire company, a steroid-obsessed father figure and incidents that bring new meaning to the concept of \"auto\" erotica. It's puzzling how director Julia Ducournau's latest even made it to the Cannes Film Festival, let alone how the picture walked away with the Palme d'Or, the event's top prize. It has since also been named France's official selection for the upcoming Oscar competition. Let's hope that saner heads prevail before that august ceremony and stop the ill-considered madness associated with this travesty before things go any further."

Heavily influenced by Gaspar Noe's \"I Stand Alone\" and \"Irreversible\", with some sequences and characters almost directly ripped from these films. Yet where Noe's films attempt, in some form, to portray some meaning in the meaninglessness via the characters who at least have some human goals (even when depicting the disturbing lead character in \"I Stand Alone\"), \"Titane\" simply portrays an inhumane caricature of emptiness that embodies the selfish self-destruction of the nihilistic mindset. The film is as cold as the titanium in its heroine, marking its attempts at cheap \"shock\" with polarizing gimmicks that consistently fall flat. An utter waste of celluloid if there ever was one. So why did it win the Palm d'Or? Politics, hijacked senses in an era of fear."

It does send a message in that regard, yet its bigger statement is a testament to the power of the LGBTQ+ lobby and to the twilight of the western cultural supremacy. Last year the festival was suspended due to COVID. The last two winners were Shoplifters from Japan and Parasite from South Corea, both ferocious critiques to the capitalist system and its inequalities. While the rest of the world is concerned about the climate and wealth distribution, the left in the west is struggling to define itself, giving precedence to identity politics while migrants drawn in the sea."

From Julia Ducornou (director of the grotesque but also very overrated 'Raw'), I can't even begin to describe what this film is about, cause even after seeing it, I still have no idea what it was even supposed to be about. (Somehow) the winner of the Palme D'or (a French Oscar) at the Cannes film festival, the film follows a woman who's a serial killer in France that finds herself in unusual circumstances when a man takes her into his home while she's on the run. And to give any more than that away would likely ruin the film, but what's the point in worrying about that when this film is simply bizarre, pretentious, and pointless just for the sake of it!? Seriously, the film is simply disgusting, weird, and random with no merit, rhyme or reason behind it (or at least no smart or justified reason) oh and to cap it all off, one of the main plot points involved the main female lead engaging in sexual intercourse with an... Inanimate object and becoming pregnant as the film progresses. Ya...this film was absurd, and not in a cool Lynchian or Cronenberg way like what many other reviewers have been saying."

I can definitely feel the influence of both Noe and Carax, both far superiors directors, but it lacks their punch if what Ducournau is going for is something like Climax or Holy Motors. The car theme was lost on me, but I did like the humanization of Alexis. She goes from random killer to son/daughter by the end and learns what it means to love and be loved. Not sure if there's supposed to be a message about gender, but I don't really care to hear it anyway, and it certainly didn't resonate.Seems like everyone is drooling over Rouselle's performance as it's her first and she carries the film, but Vincent Lindon's was more impactful for me. Rouselle was not bad by any means, but I related more to Lindon.The ending was a dud for me as well. I read another review that said it was more like a string of music videos and I can see that. Too much left out to allow the audience to connect to the protagonist, but then again, could you even connect with a psychopath?If you watch it because it got a palm, you probably won't like it, or just lie that you do. If you're intrigued by the genre, I'd recommend Holy Motors, Climax, or Irreversible. More shocking and better films."

That\u2019s all I can say about the plot as it\u2019s definitely better to go into Titane knowing as little as possible. It really feels like a mishmash of genres, never comfortably fitting into one. Occasionally a director will make a movie so insane you won\u2019t know whether you\u2019ll love it or hate it, the only thing you can do is watch it and find out. You might be disgusted and walk right out of the cinema or you might be glued to your seat unable to look away as you\u2019re too desperate to know what happens next. Either way you\u2019re in for something you\u2019ll be stuck thinking about long after you\u2019ve stopped watching. Robert Eggers got a similar reaction from me after The Lighthouse and now director Julia Ducournau has created something grotesque, unpredictable and unique. You also may remember hearing that Titane won the Palme d\u2019Or at the Cannes Film Festival so clearly some people out there really loved it, that being said I\u2019ll never watch this again.Titane is not going to be for everyone, it will shock you and make you squirm all while intriguing you and reeling you in deeper and deeper because no matter how disgusted you feel watching Titane a part of you can\u2019t help but want to know what the hell will happen next. It was giving off strong David Cronenberg vibes, so if you\u2019re a fan of his movies then there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll like Titane. Also recommended for fans of director Julia Ducournau\u2019s other movie Raw. It\u2019s safe to assume if you liked Raw then you\u2019ll probably like Titane too."

      "text": "From the opening scene, Titane continuously doubles down on its own outrageous absurdity until it suddenly pulls back. You go from watching a thriller, to body horror, to something that has a lot to say about what it means to be family. Specifically, what it means to be family in action, not just by blood or oil. Titane somehow addresses gender fluidity, the role of parents to support and accept, the male ego slipping as bodies and testosterone age away, and the opportunity to choose a family not given to you by birth all while bombarding the screen with gore and squirm inducing violence. You find you cannot look away from these disturbing images partly because of how beautifully Titane presents them and partly because they all have something to say. Even though the film may retreat too far from its own deliriousness in the second half, it comes speeding back just in time for a finale that will have you guessing until its last push. Strap in because Titane is one hell of a ride."

I felt myself squirming and not feeling right after watching this film which has not happened in a long time but the way the film uses it\u2019s stellar sound design to make you uncomfortable adds to this story of family and accepting others even though our protagonist is a horrible person. The performances and direction here are some of the best of the year with Vincent Lindon being the standout here. He gives an Oscar worthy performances. His wide range of emotions and how his character interacts with our protagonist is powerful and terrifying to watch. I really hope he isn\u2019t snubbed during this year\u2019s award season. The cinematography is pretty great at points with several shots looking absolutely phenomenal. The shots add to this powerful story and even add to the sense of uneasiness especially the final shot. The music while definitely being a weak aspect is still pretty great towards the ending with the final piece sealing the deal with the emotion of it.

Being French, there are lingering shots and introspective moments, in addition to plentiful nudity and moments of violence.

The comparisons with Cronenberg, and even with Lynch will be numerous and have grounds to be so.I can't deny Titane does offers some interesting moments, because frankly I think its ultimate value has more to do with entertainment than what it actually seems to be trying to say.And those attributes are not bad, I liked the style, but the lack of substance is inevitably questionable.Part of me is a little undecided as to how much of the film seeks to be confrontational and how much of it seeks to be enlightening.I question this because crudity is defining in this film, and everything leads to a climax that at that point feels even a bit tamed, since at that point, after everything you've seen so far, you're already desensitized, and the payoff isn't remotely gargantuan or brutal.It's simply the closure that it has been building since the plot lets you know that this is where it's going.And that's precisely the problem, because what you have seen until then makes you believe that it will be something that will make you tremble, and it doesn't happen like that.Because as it occurred with Raw, you end up talking more about the images that shocked you, rather than the underlying themes that the movie also presents, and while that's not necessarily a bad thing, they also make it clear that unless you don't make noise somehow, people won't turn their heads to look at you, and Titane, even with the things I liked, was more noise than content."
