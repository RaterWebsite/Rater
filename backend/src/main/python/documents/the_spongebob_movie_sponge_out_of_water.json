We saw this on opening night and the movie was sold out, not a spare seat in house, but were first in line!  We saw the 3D version and that was extra cool and amazing, even though it cost a bit more to see it in 3D, it was worth it.  Great message for the kids about team work.  Some special guest stars were a nice surprise too.  Run to see this movie...even if you don't have kids!"

      "text": "Summary: This movie was a **** mess... but I liked it anyway. 70/100 [B-]\r Even though it's not even close to the awesomeness of the first movie, still a good movie. The animation was great and the jokes were funny enough. The whole audience was dying of laughter! There were a lot of strange and **** up moments in the movie, there was also a reference to \"The Shining\" and I was like: What the hell am I seeing? Anyway, this movie is anything but boring. I couldn't take my eyes of the screen, I was so entertained the whole running time. The first SpongeBob movie was already surreal and weird, this one... *sigh* has crossed the line.\r The 3D was incredible, well done and eye-popping. There's a great action sequence near the end of the movie with the pirate involved (performed by Antonio Banderas), and it was so damn funny and fast-paced. On the downside, some repetitive jokes become tiresome as the running time goes, the above-water stuff was way too short and well... actually the whole movie was very short to me, I don't know why, this movie should be longer! Again, the whole above-water stuff that you can see in the trailer was actually 20% of the movie, seriously WTF, I wanted more.\r I left the theater a bit unsatisfied. I felt like I just watched a movie that's 50 minutes long. Also, another of my issues was the ending, the songs in the ending were unnecessary and a little bit annoying. In addition, another issue was the villain. Antonio Banderas was great, but his character is not very well developed, he was a quite uninteresting villain. Leaving aside its flaws, I noticed one thing, the editing is really well done and even though it has some messed up moments the movie is never confusing because its premise is so short and easy to follow.\r The editing makes the whole film more dynamic and easy to understand. So, in conclusion this SpongeBob movie is not even close to the 2004 film, but it has enough visuals and clever gags to satisfy the audience in general. The above-water sequences are so damn enjoyable, the 3D looks fantastic and there are a lot of moments in the movie that are so damn surreal and messed up! Think of an animated version of Interstellar. Also, I don't want to spoil it, but I'm just gonna say that first scene with the dolphin was so strange.\r I'm pretty sure that a lot of people will dislike this film, mainly because of the ending, some annoying songs, the **** up moments and the shortness of the film. But to me, it is not a bad movie at all. I highly recommend it, especially if you're fan of the TV show. If you're going to see it, you must see it in 3D and on a huge screen. It is a pretty good spectacle. It is great that the movie took advantage of its 3D format, it looked great. Also, do not forget to see Squidward's dancing in the end credits, it will remind you to the old times. [B-]"

      "text": "I was quite disappointed by this.  As an adult the tv show is loaded with intelligent satire, unique and quirky humor.  The combination of high and low brow humor, slapstick and innuendo is enough to keep many adults happy and entertained.\r This movie however is basically devoid of most of these things.  Aside from 2 or 3 scenes and jokes, this movie feels like it wasn't written by the same people who write for the show, or perhaps when confronted by a longer running time they choked?  Still other made for TV feature length Sponge Bob movies were funnier and more in tune with the show.\r The premise of the movie allows for some \"What if\" scenarios to unfold... but the writers seem asleep at the wheel.\r Numerous chances for the typical quirky humor of sponge bob are missed, and sponge bob is essentially little more than an exaggerated Pollyanna, which is only a small part of what makes him funny on the TV show.\r Probably the only part I truly laughed about and felt was true to the spirit of spongebob, was a sequence inside his mind...  As well as one or two gags that happened along the way.\r It felt almost like this was a bit of false advertising as the commercials showed a life action style predominantly, and most of the movie is basically the same as the cartoon.\r Overall I think this will appeal more to the younger Spongebob fanbase, and less to the parents of the show, or the kids who grew up watching it and are now adults themselves who appreciated it for it's adult friendly satire, innuendo and quirky/awkward punchlines.\r Several characters in particular feel written differently as if they have been written not by people who know and love the characters, but by people who watched a few episodes and copied down jokes and gags they saw.\r Bottom line, this isn't the first full feature length show spongebob has made, but it feels as if it is.  It is terribly derivative, bland and as if it's been cleansed of any adult humor... Maybe Nickelodeon didn't want to risk offending the parents who don't normally watch the show?\r Anyway this movie would be fine for the ten and under crowd, my 12 year old hated it (and he loves spongebob), and adults taking their kids to see this, should refrain from eating any rich meals that cause the ITIS before hand or they will end up falling asleep in their seats like I did.\r I kind of feel sorry for Antonio Banderas, because he had a fine performance, but I felt like I was watching a man who was once at the top of the game, now resorting to doing kids cartoons to pay the bills... But he certainly didn't cop out or put out a bad performance.  But this won't be another Puss N Boots for him...\r Final Verdict - Kids ten and under?  Sure, go see it with them.  Age 10+ wait till it's on Netflix or something."

The TV show where SpongeBob sells chocolate door to door make me laugh so hard my stomach hurt.  Nothing in this film is quite as funny but it still was humorous and held my attention throughout.  The animation itself was fun to look at.  It really held the attention of the kids in the theater as there weren't any squirming talking kids while it was on.  I do wish Squidward was featured more as I like his cynical personality.  The 3D effects were good as well.  It will be a Blu-ray purchase when it comes out."

Mostly, the climax of the first film was far better; the supposed tear-jerking moment wasn't as strong on this one.\r The animation is probably the film's best shining point. It is a tremendous improvement yet also a nostalgic reflection of the first movie. About 4/5ths of it was 2D while the last fifth was CGI, which surprisingly enough was quite good for the art style.\r As for the humor, it's been a long time since I've laughed at a post-season 4 joke. The writers decided to drop on the toilet humor this time, and I'm glad. Having watched Spongebob since season 2, I also appreciated the references they made to earlier episodes, including the reef blower and Squidward's interpretive dancing.\rThough the rap battle was a little superfluous in my opinion, Pharell Williams's song \"Squeeze Me\" was surprisingly catchy. I'm glad I stayed during the credits to hear it.\r So, yeah. Bottom line: good animation, good beginning storyline, good jokes, but bad ending. Nonetheless, it was a creative effort, and I have to commend the studio for the improved animation, and I hope there's gonna be a third movie as well."

This new SpongeBob movie is just like the TV show and keeps lots of the same humor that sneaks in those more adult themed jokes well still keeping it Family oriented. Obviously the story won't be anything special but the humor of how they get from point A to B is what makes this film enjoyable. For those of you who saw the trailer of all the main characters on land in Full CGI and got all excited to see a who movie like that will be sadly disappointed because that is only the last act of the film, It's a good last act but it leaves you wanting more. The animation for the Cartoon and the CGI segments of the film are done extremely well, will little minute details all over. Fans of the old TV or Movie should give this one a chance and I'm sure it's even more enjoyable with some buds and beer."

The rap at the ending though, was downright atrocious.it was clearly done by the creator of \"epic rap battles of history\" and as such reeks of his \"im better than you\" \"no im better than you\"lyrical content and his copy and paste delivery style, it had nothing to do with the film we had just watched and it cuts off the closest thing you get to a play through of the spongebob theme,it smelled so badly that it costed the film a point ."

However, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water is not that great with the marketing being completely mislead. While the animation looks great, the story was painfully average, the humor was not as funny, and the characters are not at their best. The biggest flaw has to be the misleading marketing because the trailers will make you think that this film is mostly out of the water, but it turns out that they do not come out of the water until the last 20 minutes of the film. Unfortunately, the live action sequences are not quite as memorable as the 2004 film with SpongeBob and all the other characters being superheroes for most of their screen time outside of the water. Also, the story in the water is not good either and goes nowhere for the characters. Honestly, I could recommend this film to SpongeBob fans, but the previous film from 2004 was much better. This was a very average film that does not hold up well to the last SpongeBob film."

Sponegbob is Nickelodeon's king, it is the only reason Nick went out and made a movie for this. And believe me, it was satisfying. This movie looks and feels like it's for kids, but the humor is very adulty, and it seems like Nick wanted this to be like the first, older seasons of SpongeBob, quirky and fun. All the voices return from the show, but Antonio Bandreas played, really well, a pirate. This movie feels like a stoner drug trip, the effects are turned up so high, that the scenes move at a jarring pace. Sponge Out Of Water, kept me entertained and laughing during it's runtime.

But after the movie, the show started to lose its hilariousness & now the current season just makes me so mad. The Spongebob franchise is like Adam Sandler, its glory days were wonderful, but now I just can't stand it. So I heard this movie has the producers from the first three seasons, the only ones that ever, EVER happened, so is this movie good? Not like I wanted it to be. I saw it in 2D, but I could easilly tell when they went \"Hey! Look at our cool 3D! We're hip!\". It's not 2009 anymore, nobody gives a s*$&t! Plus,?most of the humor was comparable to Batman & Robin. Yes, I went there. The pirate was annoying & he had seagull buddies which were like Jar Jar Binks, & It wasn't any better than the current season of spongebob. I will admit the last third act was actually better than the first two & I thought the third act was going to be the crappiest part. Other than that, a few chuckles, Tom Kenny, Rob Paulsen, Kevin Michael Richardson, & a cameo by one of my favorite YouTubers were this film's saving grace. Since my rating can't be used for the score, I'll put my rating here & my score above. I give \"Sponge Out of Water\" 1.8 out of 5 stars."

      "text": "To start off i like spongebob cartoon. I gave it a 3 because my 5 year old liked it and it's not a the worst movie but def. not good one. A lot of bland and dumb jokes some of them fart jokes. The seagulls were a bad idea. Love antonio banderas but kinda corny in this one cuz of script. Really dumb story seemed written by a really young kid. Expected to see much more of the 3-d spongebob  because of trailers but was maybe last 20 minutes. I was actually starting to fall asleep btw part way through. Seems like the theater crowd was forcing laughs. And most importantly just missing some of the elements that makes the cartoon loveable and the ones that were there, were bland and forced. Don't recommend it."

      "text": "\"Would you hurry up? You're making the movie too long!\" This Overlong Movie made a lot of changes as they did in the trailer. I don't think kids could understand if the movie is too long. Then you'll child would say. \"it's not long, it's an 93 min Movie.\" Yeah, right. But good things about it it's Positive, some gags are funny, and Perfect 3D Effects."

The jokes are sometimes funny the story is okay and the 1 song is amazing.\rPros: good jokes, 1 good song, story, fight scene at the end.\rcons: spongebob and plankton are tortured in the film, most jokes arn't funny, bubbles sucks, super heroes only come in in the last 11 minutes and one of patricks worst apprences to date overall 5/10"
