      "text": "Nothing new in this teen vampire flick, except for the lack of nudity. I usually stay away from these movies but the Green Metacritic rating and the name actors peeked my curiosity. It is different from the usual fare (nubile lasses needing no reason to remove their tops), but not here. Someone must owe someone as Mr Farrell and MS Collette appear. Mr Farrell may have had good fun being the \"bad guy\"  but Ms Collette is clearly here for her name as she has a very small meaningless part. There are a couple of attractive women (a fetching girlfriend and crying stripper) but also with little dialogue, although our hero does need a sweetheart to encourage him. Mr Yelchin plays it for real, although there are a few laughs, it tries to be a serious film. He is believable and does have some unusual facial expressions, but overall he is average. The film is well made, good pacing, silly and preposterous at times, but aren't most teen vampire films? I wanted to like it as the \"names\" do a credible job, but it's just not worth seeing. Not horrible, but not recommended (C+)."

The basic premise is the same but the makers definitely augmented the whole storyline.  Colin Farrell is passable, not great.  It's probably the weakest part of the film...Jerry\"s role.  The other actors and their parts are really good.  Peter Vincent's reincarnation is pretty ingenious.  Overall, this is a really good summer movie.  Really really funny too...and most of that can't be showed in trailers because it would amiss of context.  Not sure why this didn't do well at the box office...I think the trailers failed to show the humor.  The Russian kid who plays Charlie and the girl from 28 Weeks Later are excellent in their roles...as is McLovin and Toni Colette.  Most fun i had at the movie this summer...for sure."

This horror fan wasn't \"scared\" in the least - there's nothing frightening about it.  And it's just not very funny - aside from McLovin', who is genuinely solid in a small role. The lead actor (Yelchin) was a poor choice - they could have done much better.  Even the Las Vegas act - who is also funny - isn't charming enough to make it a great film.  I kept thinking that Bruce Campbell would have been a great choice to sneak into the film somehow. Also, 3D did nothing for the movie - in fact, it almost detracted from my experience.  Just another film that I have to disagree with the critics on. It happens."

      "text": "The comeback for vampires as a bankable horror sub-genre of film was still in its incubation stage when \"Fright Night\" snuck into theaters during the slasher pic's heyday back in the mid-eighties. With tactless anti-heroes such as Jason, Michael Myers, and Freddy Krueger upping the gore factor with each subsequent sequel for their respective franchises, how could the relatively subtle bloodletting induced by the fang bite of a debonair gentleman compete with arterial spray? \"The kids today, Peter Vincent, the host of a local TV \"creature feature\" show complained, \"don't have the patience for vampires. They want to see some mad slasher running around and chopping off heads.\" Charley, however, had a taste for the vintage stuff, albeit not a goth, he knew that Bela Lugosi was dead, which automatically made him an outsider like British Invasion rock aficionado Max Fleischer, whose eclectic interests helped fill the void of being without female companionship in \"Rushmore\". Likewise, the losers in \"Weird Science\", old school horror buffs both, not coincidentally, are invisible at their high school, but at least they use their geeky fandom to good use by building themselves the perfect woman, based on their viewing of \"Frankenstein\". With Lisa's help, they come of age, where the \"monster\" corrupts Gary and Wyatt, who gawk nervously at the buck naked sex goddess, unsure of how one goes about losing their virginity. Conversely, or so it seems, Charley appears all raring to bust his cherry, hers too. Amy, his girlfriend, whom he has on the floor in the opening scene, the two going at it hot and heavy, in which Charley reappropriates the televised monster flick as background noise, the coverage they need to absorb the impassioned cries of their potential lovemaking. As usually is the case, judging by Charley's incensed reaction, the girl puts a halt to their amorous doings from going any further, leaving him, once again, with, presumably, blue balls. But how blue are those balls, in actuality? This time, Amy agrees with Charlie's protestations, and makes herself available on his bed, just what he was, only moments ago, clamoring for. The moment passes. Now his attention is drawn to the neighbors next-door, carrying a coffin, like life imitating art(or an outward projection of his cinephilia), yet what could be more important to a young man than life imitating a porno. Some moments don't pass. \"Premature Burial\", like all films made during the Production Code era, was virtually free of sex and nudity. Why would a red-blooded male teen want to watch that? It should come as no surprise, then, that Charlie would rather stare out the window than ogle a half-naked nubile, since unlike other guys his age, the titillation factor in catching a glimpse of breast before the homicidal maniac stabs his sexually active sister to death(from \"Halloween\"), holds no interest for him. On a subtextual level, the coffin is not what enraptures Charlie; it's the prospect that the two men are lovers. Drawn to them, on another night when Amy isn't around, he goes outside to investigate, spying on his neighbors from behind the bushes. When Mrs. Brewster call out for her son, she blows his cover(as both a voyeur and heterosexual), whereupon detection, Jerry rolls a half-eaten red apple towards Charlie, as if enticing him to take a bite(read: to sin). Exactly what does the slightly effeminate \"Evil\" mean, when he asks his friend, \"Did she find out how you really are?\" But nevertheless, Charlie has outgrown Ed, a latent fact which the new \"Fright Night\" brings to its inevitable fruition, accurately predicting that their friendship would have eventually dissolved had his the evil one not \"died\". Reaffirming his own masculinity, Charley equates vampire fixation with liking Stephanie Meyer novels, provoking Ed to respond: \"I'm seriously angry that you think I read 'Twilight',\" while they investigate the disappearance of a mutual confidant. But Charlie, in a shrewd move on the film's part, isn't a fan like his eighties counterpart, even though it's now socially acceptable to be into vampires...if you're a girl. \"Fright Night\" aims to remind people that these nocturnal creatures have more in common with the shark from \"Jaws\" than Edward Cullen. Vampires don't glitter prettily in the sun, they burst into flames. This time around, Jerry eats green apples, and doesn't share his forbidden fruit with Charlie. This time around, Charlie discovers vampires, then he ignores Amy. The gratuitous action that dominates the third act, smacks of overcompensation for a perceived feminine genre, mirroring Charlie's own exaggerated machismo by dating a sexpot. Could there be an even more incriminating photo on Ed's phone? More than a series of vampire murders, \"Fright Night\" is about a murdered friendship, two people who are in very different places in their lives, suggesting a prequel to \"Chuck & Buck\"."

So anyways, the new Fright Night was very entertaining and it's a lot o fun for putting old style of every vampire movies or horror films to bring back some memories, until we have to watch more romantic vampires of dullness, you know the Twilight series. Colin Farrell and David Tennant did perfect job as the characters that they look extremely cool. Farrell plays the villain who he wants to terrorize the neighborhood into vampires and he's very charm to others. Tennant plays Peter Vincent who learns everything about vampires does exist to teach the rules to kill vampires. The cast did pretty okay and do like the character who seeks that his next door is a vampire. The scenes are cool to watch and sometimes it could be handy to watch in 3D (but please see this in 2D better). The story was good and almost compare to the original that they have both compliment to the original to make it new. I enjoy so much and please check out the Twilight joke where Charley talks to the McLovin character if you know what I mean."

For some reason, I founded Colin Farrell (at first) weird as a vampire. I was wrong. He delivered a great performance. The movie was surprisingly good. It had the perfect suspense, the perfect dark ambiance and even the soundtrack was awesome. The only part they left was the '' scary ''. It won't make you scared to death (for those who like to be scared, you will be disappointed), it just has a few '' jump up '' moments and some stressful scenes. Some vampire fans may appreciate the fact that it has the rules, like the vampire can come in to your house unless they are invited and the rest you already know. So it's a good, enjoyable '' end of summer '' movie."

      "text": "Fright Night is a remake and reinterpretation of the classic 1985 film, Fright Night, about a teenager, addicted to TV horror series (particularly a show called \"Fright Night\", which has a vampire hunter named Peter Vincent), who discovers that his new neighbor is a vampire, and after the neighbor noted that he knows these secret, he tries to prove this to everyone, together with his friend and girlfriend. The big difference between this version and the previous one, is that this is move fells more for a horror one, and can not recreate the atmosphere of the first film. The roles are reinvented and adapted to modern times, and to a different city (Las Vegas): Jerry Dandrige works well, but I think as Jerry Dandrige (the vampire) is not at the same level as Chris Sarandon in the classic movie, that was a better villain. The actors now, are usually better (the vampire slayer Peter Vincent, played by David Tennant is very good and funny in the role), but the film has another air, pulled into the action and horror genre (but ends up being a bit tedious) and have a end that gives the impression that the movie ended too soon. Still, it's a good entrainment as a movie, although lower than the original - My Score: 6.6 / 10.0"

It makes no sense as some parts of the film had me rolling my eyes with how boring or stupid the character and director decisions were. There are a handful of exciting moments and cool ideas but this is always juxtaposed with boredom. Not as memorable as the original film, a weaker remake on all fronts except technical, even that they don\u2019t always get right, some of the CGI looks fake (especially the awfully directed pretentious \u2018long take\u2019 whilst they are driving the car).

Charlie was supposed to be the one that believed, not Evil Ed... major difference. Tom Holland should be ashamed that he sold out, letting one of his best franchises be turned into this trash.

Colin Farrell was absolutely fang-tastic as Jerry (the vampire) and seemed to be having the time of his life, all 400 years of them! Farrell was impressive to say the least after his phenominal performance in Horrible Bosses he steps up again and takes it up another notch. The plot is simple, Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) a  teenager with everything going for him, hes popular, cool and ofcourse has the girl of his dream however when Charley's former best friend (Christopher Mintz-Plasse or McLovin to most) tries to convince him that his neighbour Jerry (Farrell) is a vampire his suspisions fall on deaf ears but very quickly Charley realises his former best friend has been right all along and as it turns out Jerry is thirsty! The film is actually pretty dark compared to the usual steroptypical films think Disturbia except with vampires and your on the right tracks. The suspense is brilliantly built throughout and combined with a more darker outset it really works well with this reboot although I have to say its far from scary. Sure there are a few moments that will make you jump but you won't be frightened enough to avoid going to your next neighbours door! All in all Fright Night is good, solid, well made movie. It makes vampires look evil again after all the Twilight outings.  Christopher Mintz-Plasse aka McLovin himself is great in albeit a small role and brings good charisma on his part but Farrell steals the show as he is dynamite throughout. Definetly worth a look and one of the shockingly good movies of the summer."

Well, maybe a LOT more. Let's start with the positive: The cast. Anton Yelchin, Colin Farrell and Toni Collette are all dynamic actors who should be able to really whip their scenes into shape. They almost succeed. Unfortunately, the actors' efforts are wasted by poor set pieces, bad pacing, lackluster attempts at humor, and bad directing. Even in a vampire spoof, the laughing should stop when the killing begins. Here, the vampire appearances are far from frightening - they are actually rather boring, and not gruesome at all. Las Vegas should be a great framework for a vampire story - here, we are just shown a small development outside of the strip which is not very spooky at all - it is rather cookie-cutter in its simplicity, which does nothing for the mood of the movie. David Tennant does what he can with the character of Peter Vincent, the great vampire killer - unfortunately, it simply is not enough. The angst he channels does not make its way off the screen, and adds very little to the plot of the movie. The CGI scenes are over-utilized and not at all frightening. Please see Fright Night for yourself - the original and the remake - and draw your own conclusions. Despite the addition of a slick, new atmosphere and popular actors, this movie falls flat - it is literally a pale ghost of the original.- Chipper F. Xavier, Esq."

Fright Night is a remake of the 1985 film starring William Ragsdale (Herman from \"Herman's Head\" for those of you old enough to recollect the failed sitcom). What is new about Fright Night v 3 or FN 2011 as it were, is Colin Farrell. Farrell brings a much needed edginess and let's face it, a believable bad boy vibe to the franchise. Even better is the added bonus of Christopher Mintz-Plasse returning to his McLovin' roots by acting like a bamboozling buffoon. There is nothing more pleasurable than watching the clumsy geek-Ed Nelson (Mintz-Plasse) turn into the frightful vampire 'Evil' Ed Nelson. Newsflash people, turning into an undead creature of the night does not guarantee a change of personality, a mailing address perhaps, but that's it!http://www.screenspotlight.com/movie-reviews-mainmenu-47/34-horror/898-fright-night"

      "text": "Fright Night is a great horror not because it is the scariest (it isn't), or the most richly layered (it isn't), or speaks the most about the genre as a whole (it doesn't). Fright Night is a great horror film because it remembers that just because it can be scary doesn't mean it can't be a lot of fun. It's an antidote to the sickening \"torture porn\" craze as much as an antidote to the \"soft vampires\" that Stephanie Meyer and Anne Rice have sickened us with for the last 18 years."

I Dont remember the original one but I am pretty sure i did so not gonna judge between them . Colin acting as the Vampire was really good . Anton did good and David Tennant did really good job . I really liked the small town and the weather . Waited so long to see this kinda weather in a horror film . effect was amazing and Craig  did good . Its the script that seems a little dull to me(again not compering) . The could make more awesome . End was not good . but overall enjoyable film just not what i expected."

      "text": "What a waste of  a good movie idea and our  Farrell and Tennant who are both capable of turning in performances 100% better than this with their eyes closed if given a chance. Shockingly bad performance by Anton Yelchin-wooden enough to play a vampire hunters stake. I was looking forward to this but it turned out to be just another example of a director  throwing away a chance of a good remake by pandering to the USA  teen market."

I mean the human to vampire transformations were just ridiculous, it was a bit boring and annoying at same times, didn't make the cut for me for best movies of the year (I already knew it wouldn't, vampire movies are good until they reach the point of exhaustion, which means by the 20 first minutes)."

      "text": "While I wouldn't say this is the greatest movie of all time or even close.  I would say this is a fun movie to go see. The scares are more subtle and the humor is easy to follow.  This is a remake of the older 80's film it does however take a darker twist to it.  Ferrell's Jerry role is much more intimidating and scarier than the old version.  Some people wont understand the film or are looking to deep for something that isnt there.  This film is predictable but it isnt about the epic story twisting or some nonsense like that and there are no Emo-Vamps in this.  If your looking for a more classic style movie of bang here it is then this is the movie for you, I relate it to a simplistic roller coaster.   I can just sit and enjoy the ride so to speak."

I have to say this movie was great and while watching the movie we didn't even notice that we were basically alone. Colin Ferrel's take on Jerry's character is a very refreshing rebirth of Chris Serandon's sexy seductive vampire. Things like the green apple obsession remind lovers of the original that the movie producers hadn't forgotten this movies roots. I wish it had done better because this truly was the best movie I saw over the summer."

      "text": "I should have seen this at the cinema but I got caught up in other things. It sounded extremely fascinating when I first heard about this, mostly considering there were some great actors in it, like David Tennant and Colin Farrell. When I did see this a couple of days ago, I suddenly agreed with my previous statement. To make it more effective, my parents turned out all the lights in the house, so all I could see was this disturbing glow of a bloodthirsty vampire tearing out someone's throat. Colin Farrell makes for a very effective vampire; (he was my favourite character) he didn't really scare me, he was more creepy than that. He certainly had the look and quality of a vampire. Remakes aren't normally as good as the original, but despite the normality, the acting, the dialogue, the atmosphere - it all creeped the hell out of me. This is also fantastically gory and the actors just passed swiftly under it, refusing to give in despite the fact that there was a vampire on the loose. Nothing like Twilight - as Ed described Jerry (cool name for a supernatural creature by the way) - he's the freaking shark from Jaws. In fact, this is very, very good quality. Would have liked it to have a higher score, but at least the reviews were mostly favourable. It just seemed a damn shame that I didn't see it when it came out, especially in 3D. It was extremely thrilling and heart-pounding though anyway. Highly recommended."
