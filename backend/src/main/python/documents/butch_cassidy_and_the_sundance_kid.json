His closest companion is the laconic dead-shot Sundance Kid. As the west rapidly becomes civilized, the law finally catches up to Butch, Sundance and their gang.  Chased doggedly by a special posse, the two decide to make their way to South America in hopes of evading their pursuers once and for all.", "releaseYear": "1969", "mpaaRating": "PG", "imageUrl": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/gFmmykF1Ym3OGzENo50nZQaD1dx.jpg", "categories": {"plot": 7.666666666666667, "acting": 7.6875, "ending": 9.5, "soundtrack": 7.666666666666667, "cinematography": 7.714285714285714, "familyFriendly": 8.0, "funny": 8.2, "action": 6.5}, "reviews": [{"rating": "8", "text": "Really good film. The chemistry between Paul Newman and Robert Redford is infectious as one picks up right where the other left off the entire film. It was also unexpectedly quite funny, as the one liners were just priceless and show why the screenplay has received so much praise and why it deserves all of that praise. As with most of these classic westerns, the cinematography and set pieces were phenomenal and in this one, the action sequences were great and incredibly intense. The chase sequences were also great and I love how we are kept in the dark as to who is following them, just as they do not know. While I loved this, there were some definite negatives. First of all, there was no real plot, other than focusing on the exploits of Butch and Sundance, though it does not really go anywhere. Not a major complaint, but a complaint nonetheless. Another small complaint would be the pacing, as at times it got a tad too slow, but throughout much of the film, the slow pace was never that much of a problem. My main complaint would be Katharine Ross. Her acting here, in my opinion, was just flat out bad. I never really bought into her character and she was severely outclassed by her two legendary castmates."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This movie shows us that a western film can be entertaining and intriguing without a bad ass main character that wins 3:1 gunfights.

In-depth yet jovial and vivacious. This rustic film brings out all kinds of emotions."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "An amazing film. Very unconventional Western , but it is without a doubt, still, a Western. And one of the best I've ever seen. The characters are what really sell this movie the most, Newman and Redford play their roles so well that without them I wonder if the movie would work at all. It's too bad that so many of the \"film experts\" seemed to entirely miss the point of the movie-but the audiences love it, and the film is regarded by many to be among the greatest Western films made-for a good reason. I don't want to start rambling on and on about how amazing it is, so I'll stop-you go see it yourself, and nothing else will need to be said. Great stuff."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Infamous Wild West robbers, do one too many robberies, authorities come after them, move to Bolivia, same again.A fantastic \"buddy\" film making two legendary criminals very like-able. Paul Newman is the charming schemer whilst Robert Redford the pretty but deadly one. Superb chemistry between the actors make this fun & of course the ending is moving & iconic.Not the grittiest of Westerns but a really entertaining watch."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "It's a classic. Two great actors."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "\"Gorge Cassidy\" (Paul Newman), a.k.a. \"Butch Cassidy\", and \"Lonny Longbaugh\" (Robert Redoford), a.k.a. \"The Sundance Kid, are two of the greatest robbers in the history of the Old West. They pulled jobs on banks and trains with an expertise that made them famous from coast to coast.\r Now, years after being out of the business for about two decades, they decide to pull one last bank heist in Bolivia, with the help of a school teacher (Katharine Ross) with romantic ties to both men.\r I have to say that I am pretty disappointed in this film. I found it to be slow, with not enough action considering the topic of the movie. It dragged so much that I noticed spending more attention to my computer than watching the movie itself on cable television.\r One thing that stood out was the on-screen relationship between Newman and Redford. This is what carries the movie I believe, and most likely why this movie is called a classic now. You feel as if the two are not just partners in crime, but friends with the ribbing that they give one another.\r Another problem with this movie is the soundtrack. The only piece of music that is memorable is Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head by BJ Thomas, and that was a weird tune for a Western set in the Old West. If you ask me, the song was just an odd choice.\r I also barely enjoyed Ross as \"Etta Place\". Her character was barely developed if you asked me. It appeared that she was there as a romantic interest, and to help teach \"Butch\" and \"Sundance\" Spanish for their attempt at robbing the Bolivian bank.\r If you expect a lot of gunfights, you are mistaken on this one. Of what there is in the movie, they are short and well placed.\r The cinematography is hard for me to judge since Encore Westerns used a pan-and-scan format. I had to deal with only half of a scene when two people were talking to one another. But, from wide shots, I could see some spectacular scenery, including the famous scene when the title characters jump from a cliff into the water.\r Because it was declared a classic, I've been wanting to see this movie. I am highly disappointed in it."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Newman and Redford's chemistry will seep out of the TV and onto the of your living room in \"Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid,\" William Goldman and George Roy Hill's love letter to the beautifully rustic charms of the American Old West.

It's got sass, wit, blisteringly funny moments of levity, and a rightful place on the brighter side of film history."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The plot with the slow pace and elegant design the best thing in the movie, the main characters, who are perfectly played by Redford and Newman,, conveying to the viewer a relationship of equilibrium and friendship between them"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "A film that has rightly become a classic. An anti-western with the heroes on the run for most of the film, it broke the mould in how westerns were being made.

Hall's cinematography was well executed within transforming from silent sepia format to color with sound as this western astounds you it rivals Bonnie and Clyde with more ways than one featuring my favorite oscar winning song \"Raindrops\""}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I know there are people who love or don't like this film, but I am one of those who loves it. It is a different kind of western, but in my mind, that is not a bad thing, quite the contrary. I loved the first ten minutes, that was very clever and refreshing. The cinematography is fabulous, doing perfect justice to the beautiful scenery. The score is suitably jaunty, and the Raindrops Falling on My Head interlude is a wonderful touch and quite moving come to think of it. The script is witty and infectious, not to mention memorable, and the direction and pace I had no problem with either. Robert Redford and especially Paul Newman are perfect as the charismatic outlaws and their chemistry is simply unforgettable. All in all, just a great movie and one of my favourites of the genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Beyond Clint Eastwood and John Wayne there were Robert Redford and Paul Newman when were young and fab. The supposedly true story about bandits, train robbers and their search for new horizons and places to steal. The plot has an appeal that does not expire until the last minute and leaves us in doubt as to whether our heroes survive or not. For binge while the home arrest."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Nobody can argue with how great Redford and Newman are together in this film. Their interaction makes them so funny and charming that it would be difficult to not root for them, regardless of the fact that they are bank robbers. However, the movie has a strange pace, and even stranger music. The \"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head\" sequence seems really out of place and will definitely remind you that you are watching a movie. It's certainly not a bad movie, but it is difficult to see why it is regarded as such a classic considering other movies that are usually mentioned alongside it."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "people kept robbing it..Butch Cassidy And The Sundance KidThe chemistry between the lead characters is the key to this feature that breeds soft moments in this hardcore western world where everything is fair. George Roy Hill's brilliant execution skills helps this feature sail off to the shore smoothly where a bit more editing would have done no harm. Robert Redford and Paul Newman are convincingly good in their sibling sort of relation and carries it all on their shoulder. Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid being a character driven feature has brilliant performance, execution and character development in it but unfortunately lacks a gripping screenplay that may allow the audience to drift off once in a while."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I really enjoyed this film - its a classic biopic, with great performances from Paul Newman and Robert Redford as the titular characters. This isn't a western film, like I maybe accidentally assumed it to be, although it does have a western feel to it. Its not full of action, though there is plenty of that at times. Its a good character driven drama, with some very witty dialogue and some quite amusing scenes, plus some reasonably tense moments too. I could have done without the montage mid way through shot in old fashioned brown  - with music playing over still shots but I guess it helps tell the story of what isn't being shown on screen, namely the two criminals travelling to Bolivia. I found the incidental music played in the background a short while later quite amusing too. I was surprised how entertaining and amusing this was really. Also I can't not compliment it on the great wide landscape shots. The cinematography certainly isn't bad. Given this film dates from 1969, it stands up quite well and I'd certainly recommend this."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Terrible movie just terrible!Acting, action, camera work, dialogue and storytelling are beyond ****"}], "recommendations": ["the_untouchables", "casino", "the_assassination_of_jesse_james_by_the_coward_robert_ford", "catch_me_if_you_can", "rush", "the_harder_they_fall", "true_grit", "the_last_of_the_mohicans", "lawless", "unforgiven", "hell_or_high_water", "ford_v_ferrari", "django_unchained", "the_grand_budapest_hotel", "rear_window", "chinatown", "north_by_northwest", "legend", "rocky", "notting_hill", "crazy_heart", "the_aviator", "backdraft", "news_of_the_world", "american_hustle"]}
