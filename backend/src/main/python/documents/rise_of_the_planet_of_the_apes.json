Humanities cruelty and fear of that which we don't understand are the core themes here. The movie takes a look of how they, along with our arrogance can lead to our downfall.\r Andy Serkis once again shows that he is the master of motion capture, but this time he is backed up by other talented individuals. Every facial expression is excellently captured and display emotion in believable ways. They allow the ape characters to have real personalities, yet still feel and look like animals in the process.\r It's a good thing the ape characters are so well done, because the humans aren't. Most of them are just stereotypical villains. Our lead human character played by James Franco suffers do to a lackluster performance. Franco doesn't show any of emotion when it's needed. This can lead to scenes with him losing power.\r Overall though this is an amazing origin story. It made me establish an interest in a franchise I previously didn't care about. It's touching, powerful, and an all around excellent film. One I highly recommend seeing."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I really liked this film. Nearly every ape, if not all, were performance-capture CGI, and every one of them looked incredibly realistic. Serkis is particularly brilliant as Caesar.

It's good but not great. The plot gets a bit dull during the halfway point and you sit in your seat wondering when the whole rest of the movie is going to take off. Some of the dialogue between the human actors I felt was unneeded and really took us away from Caesar's problems (the real star of the movie). The next door neighbor was an irrelevant role, who's whole purpose in the film is to get sick? I mean the guy repeated the same line at least four times in the movie \"Just get out of here!\" The man only spoke about nine lines the whole movie.

Nice that Caesar was a tip of the hat to Roddy McDowell, more so than Charlton Heston, he's Mr. Planet Of The Apes and this was a worthy edition to the original legacy.\r The apes saga is very clever as it's given itself a free pass for sequels and prequels - The original planet of the apes is sequeled by 'return' which although a bit hammy (bar the cool abrupt end) gives us the setup for the absolutely superb 'escape from the planet of the apes' IMO actually the strongest, most brutal and striking of the original films. Seeing Cornelius and Zera change from celebrities into feared and persecuted risks to humanity was brilliant.\rConquest could have been alot better but the ideas are definitely there - battle is very hammy but takes it to it's logical conclusion at the slightly averted timeline so we shouldn't get the events of 'planet of the apes' - it could have been alot better but was done on such a small budget that the 'epic' battles look pathetic. What was sad was the decreasing budget as the series went on - certainly 'conquest ' and 'battle' had poorer makeup than even the original- to be fair I thought the lead apes makeup was very good - it's only in the crowd ape scenes you see they skimped on everyone else- Zera and Cornelius conveyed an awful lot of emotion even through the latex. I guess the new one could be seen as a 'true' prequel to 'planet' as it shows us how we got to the events without a paradox."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I enjoyed the film, As did my family. The few flaws the film had are as followed - James Franco is a terrible lead. He shows no emotion and honestly he is so plain and simple that its painful to watch him when he is on screen. The film is a bit predictable, Not very predictable but if you pay close attention you can almost always tell what will happen next. The script is terrible. Its makes everything seem so straight forward and it really doesnt add any creativity to the film what so ever. Thanks to a terrible straight forward script - It brought the entire film down quite a bit.\r However despite all this - Andy Serkis is amazing in this film. He truely brings the role of Caesar to life and should be at least nominated for a golden globe (which he wasnt) and an academy award for his performance. Also the action sequences and the interaction between all the apes,chimps, and so on and so forth is good as well.

There\u2019s also much famous and great actors like David Hewlett, who I\u2019m a big fan of. I would love to say it\u2019s a well-written film, but unfortunately it\u2019s not. It took almost the whole first and second act until the movie really began, and there are some \u201cI predicted it sequences\u201d. The action is very low, and that bored the hell out of me. The greatest flaw in this movie is the CGI; I would rather watch the original Planet of The Apes. Yes it\u2019s that bad. There are many negative aspects, but the ending is surprisingly great and that made me crave for the sequel.\r A great plot and superb actors, but the disturbing flaws like terrible CGI and too much lack of action pulls my rating under an 8.

It's Caesar (played by Andy Serkis, which he did a phenomenal job) , ladies and gentlemen, a surprising animal that you will get attached to. So the movie starts a little slow. It's the beginning when Will Rodman (James Franco) adopts the chimpanzee, and starts to build a relationship. Then the story progresses quickly, until things are about to get real (when the apes escape). The first part is more about whats going on with the drug (a cure for Alzheimer tested on the chimpanzees) and the situation with Caesar, but it's still intriguing. Then the other part is the action. What I liked about '' Rise of the Planet of the Apes '' is that you can feel the chemistry between Will and Caesar. Also, there were some awesome parts that I wouldn't expected to be in the story.

Before I begin reviewing this one, I have a confession to make: I never saw any of the planet of the apes films (like I said in my review of the remake). Yeah, shocking wasn't it? But I did heard that they were very creative films. So, after seeing Tim Burton's disappointing remake, I saw the trailer for this movie when I saw Captain America: The First Avenger and I was so amazed I wanted to see it so badly. A few days later, I've succeeded in seeing it and boy was I impressed at how good it was. I'm not gonna write the plot because it's unnecessary, so I'm just gonna go with my opinion.Visual/Setting: The story revolves around San Francisco which is a very nice place to film this movie and was very creative.Plot/Premise: The plot was perfectly well-paced. The premise about the intelligent animals taking over the world was a very smart idea ever to put on film.Acting/Characters: Every actor you see has great talent. James Franco did an amazing as the main character even he and his love interest played by Freida Pinto were enjoyable. Andy Serkis gave out his excellent performance as Caesar, the intelligent ape and the leader of the clan. The rest of the actors, including Tom Felton from Harry Potter, were very entertaining.Action/CGI: This movie is packed with incredible action scenes with the apes that were very important to the story and the CGI effects along with motion capture were very solid.Problem: The ending was completely weak and gave me a WTF moment.Rise of the Planet of the Apes is not only an excellent reboot of a soon-will-become franchise, but one of the greatest movies of the year next to some of my favorites.90/100 A-"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I was pleasantly surprised.  Caesar (Andy Serkis) is incredible throughout, and the movie is worth seeing for his performance alone. Franco is decent, and Pinto is just a throw-in, but the story is solid.  You knew that with the PG-13 rating, you're not going to see a ton of human carnage at the hands of the apes. (Yes, there are exceptions.)  I'd have to agree with most of the critics that it's one of the best summer action flicks - and better than just about every comic book hero flick in my mind.  (There's an additional scene shortly after the credits begin, but nothing post-credits, so no need to wait for it - fyi.)"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A very solid piece of film making. Brilliant pacing and the CGI is incredible. Blows  Tim Burton's movie out of the water and even rivals the original for pure entertainment.

But other than that - awesome."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The Good:  Great acting, greatest CGI character ever, entertaining, touching, and a true reboot to the original.  The Bad:  Special effects were a little shaky in parts, undertones were too strong, and the science was too shallow.  When a sci-fi movie comes out, I always have to compare it to Jurassic Park in terms of story telling.  Jurassic Park took a real premise and put their own twist on it and bent it to fit their lore and they made it work with precision.  One of my main gripes with this film is that it never sets you to truly believe in the lore.  Unlike Jurassic Park, where they explained everything and showed intelligent thought behind it, Rise of the Apes is just flat, just hoping that the audience will buy into \"hey apes are smart\" and never question it.  Now I know this is a sci-fi movie, so I understand that to a certain extent \"turning off your brain\" is required, but this film simply milked that requirement too much, this wasn't something that ruined the movie, but it was significantly more than a gripe, because while watching the movie, in the back of my mind i kept saying to myself that this is impossible on so many levels and i demanded answers and the movie never truly filled that gap.  However, the shaky special effects is nothing more than a gripe, this movie did go out of its way to shove its undertones down your throat.  It plays the cards of: Animal cruelty, animal testings, big corporations are bad and just want money, and etc.    Whether you agree with what its saying is irrelevant, it got to the point where the undertones were just obnoxious.  Although i've spent all this time bashing the film, it actually is a really good piece of art.  The actors all step up to the plate, however some of the characters were a bit cliche'd, but overall the acting was excellent.  The movie created \"out of this world\" emotional attachment with the apes, and even gets you to betray your species.  While movies like \"Transformers\" just rely on explosions and hot women to sell the film, RIse of the Apes actually creates a wonderful story and moving characters and I hope that there will be sequels."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I liked the movie very much.I can say that it is one of the  best movies of 2011.It is well acted and also contains some amazing fight scenes.i can honestly say that it would be a blockbuster."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I was proven VERY wrong about this film.

There are a lot of eye rolling moments, such as the humans are all stupid, the corporation greedy at all costs, the animal shelter that abuses animals, shooting lots of apes with machine guns at close range never hitting any, an army of apes that appear apparently from nowhere, etc. etc.  The film has nothing original to offer at all and is a conglomeration of many other films.  If you're young and haven't seen as many movies as I have you will enjoy it a lot more than I did.  The CGI and special effects are very good and there is no slow parts so it did hold my attention.

Now this is new Planet of the Apes that people enjoy it so much and I watch this movie that it's more better than the Tim Burton version that doesn't hold up for now. I'm very impress that this reboot of Planet of the Apes is very strange story than the old version. I love the old version that has design of costumes, silly apes, great acting of over the top of any human could scream like Charlton Heston, and the story was great at times. But far from now, the new was pretty good that has best special effects that apes can do and of course Andy Serkis gets the best.

There are some gripping sequences, I admit, but they aren't in the service of anything larger.  And frankly, I don't think PotA is a great series to mine for remakes.

The idea of the film is good - to give us a prelude to the story we all know rather well for over 3 decades now. In films like this one expects a lot of visual effects, dumb plot and paper-thin dialogue. For a change, this is different. The dialogue is not as bad as it could have been, which goes to the credit of the writers. That being said, it is not good either. The direction of the film is absolutely horrible, and Wyatt is obviously a rookie who should not have been given the lead with this. My biggest issue in the film was the straight-out ridiculous portrayal of the monkeys, especially Caesar. While he is supposed to be highly intelligent and human-like, the director has taken it a bit too far, that it becomes almost a mockery and, in a strange way, insulting to monkeys. Yes, I cannot believe I am writing this either, but I felt as if it was not a positive portrayal - not that it was meant to be anyway. Nonetheless, it made me rather uncomfortable and it's not because of the prospect of a monkey-led apocalypse. The acting is mediocre, despite the rather decent cast. The visual effects are good enough, and the monkeys are extremely credible. I am excited to see what will happen with the franchise, but I do hope that the director will change. It has set a decent standard for the next film, which can only help the sequel, since this film wasn't too bad, but it shouldn't be too hard to make a better follow up one.

On that count it succeeds. I genuinely felt for Caesar, the head-ape, and that's testament to the motion capture acting and CGI . I was rooting for the apes the whole way through and in that sense its a little like watching a football match. Apes Vs Humans. You want to see your side fight with some heart, play to the whistle and come out on top, knowing that victory will be so sweet.

Much has been made of the CGI ape(s) and Sertis' role is immeasurable to making this work, but there is a major if unavoidable flaw and that is that the CGI ape is a human acting like an ape, which means we see human expressions and mannerisms. Just because an ape gets smarter does not mean it automatically takes on human gestures. That would take a huge evolutionary span. As great as the CGI is it's presence too often means that the intelligence of the movie suffers, and in the end we get a CGI spectacle but poor writing, plotting, and illogical presentation."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Easily the best movie of the summer and, so far, the best movie I've seen this year.
