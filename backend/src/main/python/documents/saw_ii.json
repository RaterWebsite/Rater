What I always loved about the movies were the character development, and the story. The traps don't matter in this movie, it's all about Eric Matthews trying to find his son and doing everything he can to find him. Tobin Bell gives a great performance as Jigsaw/John Kramer. The movie may have flaws with the characters in the Nerve Gas House and some of the traps but over all it's a great detective movie & a good thriller check it out."

We won't see Doctor or Adam here, but there's Amanda, which is nice, and then a few new characters, which I personally liked. They must escape together. Compared to one, there is a faster pace and there is not just one room or actually as if it is, but it has more floors. There's always something going on here. In the end, I was very satisfied and the overall resolution of the story, which, although not surpassing the previous part, is still great and overall I recommend Saw 2."

      "text": "Saw II is bigger, bloodier, but not better than its predecessor. Sure, Jigsaw's \"games\" are more extravagant and brutal, but the film lacks the clever plotting and tension of the original Saw. John Kramer (Tobin Bell) still makes a fantastic horror movie villain - he's charismatic, threatening and utterly deranged, and its great to get under the skin of the character a little in this installment (no matter how unpalatable it might be) and understand what makes him tick. Donnie Wahlberg's Detective Eric Matthews makes a good enough protagonist, and the explosive extended dialogue scene between him and Kramer is the most compelling in the film. The rest of the cast are a bit underwhelming, and simply serve as lambs to the slaughter for the purpose of entertainment. I can't really deny that the film has moments that serve a certain deranged craving for schadenfreude found in all human beings, but the film as a whole loses a great deal of its energy and motivation after the first couple of these torture-porn-serving set-pieces. It just doesn't engage quite as the first film did, and only works on a single level. The film's big twist is also rather underwhelming when compared to the shock of the first film's - this time round, you see it coming a mile off. Still, Saw II is diverting, and makes for a decent enough Friday night gore-fest, just don't expect anything more."

I feel genuinely embarrassing that a grown up person comes up with something this shallow, and dare call it good film. It simply isn't a good film from a storyline perspective.As regard to character development, there is nearly none. It really goes to show what the real purpose is.The real purpose is as simple as a outlet for sadistic and primitive urges. Not that there's something wrong with that. But trying to market it as anything else than what it is, is just wrong.If you like blood, unrealistic scenes(in a film that tries to be realistic) and no story to speak about whatsoever, then this is a film for you."

The acting is still good. The horror is good but the traps this time around are not scary at all but they do still provided a little bit of suspense because it was hard to predict the outcome. The twist ending was interesting but a little predictable (I figured it out about 1/2 way into the movie). Still, Its a suprisingly decent horror film that trys to live up to the first film but fails imo."

Yes the Jigsaw killer is back and has a new game in place with a larger number of people in play this time round. The story of Detective Matthews is a fairly boring affair, a rogue cop who does whatever he can to get an arrest even planting evidence, attacking suspects and giving false statements is in the list of things he is known for. Jigsaw has taken his son and several others and placed them in a house with the simple premise to get the antidote to the toxin in the air for each person by completing set tasks for each person. Whist being interrogated by Matthews Jigsaw must keep his game in play and keep Matthews distracted long enough to lure him into an even bigger trap. Saw II is a crime drama with some blood thrown in here and there, nothing compared to the edge of your seat thriller the first was."

      "text": "Silly, gratuitous, and nonsensical as they are, the Saw movies may have something to them after all. Much like The Three, the serial-killer film scripted by \"Donald Kaufman\" in Adaptation, they're written in full knowledge of all their bone-collecting, skin-stitching, Seven Deadly Sins-reckoning predecessors, yet the psychology has been completely stripped away, leaving only the gimmicks behind. To some extent, the Saw franchise may be the B-movie answer to classier fare like The Silence Of The Lambs and Se7en\u2014both Saw and the new Saw II reveal their heady moral and thematic agendas as pseudo-sophisticated window dressing for the grisly contraptions they actually are. Stripped down to the barest genre essentials, Saw is a spring-loaded killing machine, packed with sadistic little deathtraps and ludicrous macabre twists, and its quickie sequel offers more of the same, which should again appease viewers who enjoy being jerked around.\r In a novel reversal on the original, evil puppetmaster Tobin Bell (nicknamed \"Jigsaw\" because he cuts puzzle pieces out of his victims' skin) pulls back the curtain and spends the entire movie in plain sight, but he still holds all the cards. Though not quite as tortured as Danny Glover's madman-in-the-attic in Saw, cop Donnie Wahlberg has reason for stress when he discovers that Bell has abducted his son (along with about half a dozen others), and is holding them in a booby-trapped house. Through security monitors mounted in every room, Wahlberg and his team can only watch helplessly as the hostages struggle to free themselves within the two hours before their bodies implode from the nerve gas being pumped through the vents. But Bell relishes his role as dungeonmaster, so he offers a way out in the form of a game: If the hostages can figure out the combination to the safe in the middle of the room, they'll find the antidote inside.\r As in Saw, the solutions are often just as bad as the problem: Sure, you can unlock that spiked steel trap mounted on your head, but first you have to find the key, which is planted behind your eye socket. (Here's a scalpel. Enjoy.) Bell claims he never kills anybody and that his victims are masters of their own fate, but that's a little like a schoolyard bully grabbing a weakling's arm and doing the \"stop hitting yourself\" routine. Co-writer Leigh Whannell, the sole creative holdover from the original, knows well enough not to mess with success, and he perpetuates Saw's sick, arbitrary formula without fail. The good news for moviegoers is that there's a way to enjoy Saw II: Simply grab the scalpel from under the chair, carve a hole in your forehead, and remove your frontal lobe."
