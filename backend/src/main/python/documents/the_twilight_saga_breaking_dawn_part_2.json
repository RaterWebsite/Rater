First of all, I haven't watched all of the movies nor read the books; I've only watched part 1 and I really hated it, but at least that movie was just boring and that's it. In here, it's a slap to your expectations, a betrayal of hope, a disaster of story. I liked how it started and, even if the obvious non-sense they were saying and hilarious details they had to introduce, I was at least enjoying and waiting for the big finale, the epic battle of great proportions. I wasn't honestly waiting much from Twilight but then I at least didn't get bored...but I'm sorry again to say that the ending is a complete disaster and really disappoints on all aspects, not only wasting a REALLY good scene, but making it a complete joke (SPOILER: the final battle was just a vision: nothing of that the trailer showed basically happened, and that was the strong part of the movie). YES, I do know that in the books it ended \"technically\" like this, but then...what was the point of making \"THAT\" scene if you're going to rip everyone off! I feel so disappointed, not as a fan (which I'm NOT), but as a person who tries to enjoys movies. I don't know what else to say, except that I wish I didn't watch it....for those who really want to see the ending to this saga...I would say avoid it....or go ahead and make yourself home I...have no words to describe how terrible this was. You have been warned."

I've read the books, so I already knew what was going to happen, but somehow it doesn't seem that cheesy until you see bad actors act it out with angsty piano music.  That being said, it certainly wasn't worse than the other movies.  Oh, wait, except for a suger creepy CGI baby.  WTF?  Can't you just use a real baby?  I don't care what the book says, it having teeth isn't really that important, just use a real baby.  People in the theatre were \"aww\"-ing like it was cute.  It's not cute, it's face is covered in poorly done CGI.  Atleast Renesmee doesn't stay a baby for long.  The climax and ending were well done until a lame montage of Edward+Bella moments from the whole series at the very end.  No one needs to see that, they've all seen all the movies."

      "text": "Let me start this review by saying that I have read all the books in this series and watched all the movies to date and frankly I'm not a fan. Why do I continue to watch each installment then? Because I am a fan of how directors interpret text onto the big screen and I can whole heartedly say that Bill Condon's take on this 'B Script' novel is to be commended. He adds all the missing pieces of the book whilst still staying true to the novel itself, which is no easy task. For the first half of this movie, you can expect the same 'Twilight-esqe' feel that is recurrent in past installments however with Bella's new found life, her character is finally allowed to breathe a bit - which makes for a better Bella than the sulky one we're used to. The acting all around is good, however Michael Sheen (Aro) steals the show with a stellar performance as the series' villain. The certain aspect of this movie that really redeemed the series as a whole however is its ending - it is everything you would expect from a grand finale with jaw dropping sequences, beautifully choreographed set pieces and edge of your seat action all the way through. All of this whilst Condon maintained respect for the text it came from (even though the text itself lacked execution). Whilst this isn't a very glamourous movie (the CGI Reneesme looked quite awful at times and cast members apart from the main characters had little to no substance) it's ending is truly one that will be remembered. Remembered not for it's engagement or action sequences, but for its adaptation from paper to screen. A bunch of words that lacked execution and if copied word for word would have crumbled on the big screen. However a clever director carefully tailored this delicate story to not only suit a cinema audience, but also occasional readers, action orientated fans and Twi-hards alike. Bill Condon - Well done!"

No. Yet the performances are solid except for a few, the visual and special effects are stunning, and it is beautifully filmed. It manages to be funny throughout the film, but this time on purpose. It embraces its absurdity and complete dumbness with ease. Although in the end they shouldn't have made a last minute change, and should have left it where it was going it still manages to leave you happy in a way. You won't be disappointed, but you won't be thrilled with it either. Most people who have not read the books will think it is stupid and weird, but if you have you will enjoy it. I do not like the Twilight films but this left me liking it, but not loving it. I give this film 62%."

This successfully classifies as one of the worst films in existence. Get ready to see the spectacle that should never have started in the first place!"

I had not seen the one film before, because I thought \"New Moon\" was horrible, horrible, horrible, but a friend took me out so figured might as well. To tell the truth, this is not a bad film. Nor is it a good film. It's there in between, in mediocrity. Let's start with visuals - the effects can be pretty nice, but I just couldn't get over the horrible editing with them, especially when they run \"supersonic\" or whatever it is. Made the film look amateurish and cheap. Other effects were quite good. Acting - not bad. Stewart, whom I usually dislike strongly, was actually bearable. The rest of the cast was ok, too. Storyline was a bit problematic. Ultimately, nothing really happens in the film. I... yeah, that's really it. There's all this builtup but it doesn't quite work out. It just doesn't quite match up with...well, anything. So, comparatively, it was rather decent, but the story was still bad. Bottom line, I guess. Better than the other Twilight films I've seen (only first two) but still not a good film. 5/10"

The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, Part II is the end of those Gothic teenagers are facing the Volturi members who dresses like bad hooded Halloween costumes because they concern to get rid of the CG baby or pale little girl. I'm getting so much tired for these characters that it still has that same clich\u00e9s like standing around doing nothing, wooden dialogue, and always stares. Kristen Stewart wont save up for this movie and she still have that dumb expression and even these two dull heroes including Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner are finding way to get out of this movie. Be in mind that there's a scene where Jacob Black is going to stay near to the little girl and of course grows up and fell in love with the big CG effect wolf forever, how inconvenient. It's very gross to see a hungry pedophilia wolf to make connections with the awful CG baby. Breaking Dawn, Part II is the lamest and final movie that ended up pretty quick. I can't stand this movie a lot and thank heavens that the haters and audiences are getting better to go step away to the next movie without that lovey dovey vampire movies.

On the other hand, the movie gets better when the story line develops (eventually). I have read the books, and to be fair, they are so much better than the films. As a teenager who can \"relate\" to the movies, I feel no real connections with the vampires and werewolves in the film, like I do in the book. I don't see why twilight has the stereotype of being particularly for teenagers. I know many adults who enjoy a romantic fantasy now and again. Overall, I believe that if you want a good read, go for the books. However, the film is not worthwhile to go and spend your money on.
