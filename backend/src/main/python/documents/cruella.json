She befriends a pair of young thieves who appreciate her appetite for mischief, and together they are able to build a life for themselves on the London streets. One day, Estella\u2019s flair for fashion catches the eye of the Baroness von Hellman, a fashion legend who is devastatingly chic and terrifyingly haute.

I loved how they reinvented the Cruella character to make her more of an antihero and how they totally changed up the One Hundred and One Dalmatians story but still keep some elements in like Anita, Roger, Pongo, and Perdita as well as the Cruella de Vil song. The costumes were just spectacular, some of the best costumes I've ever seen. The performances from Emma Stone and Emma Thompson were outstanding, just perfection Stone did an excellent job at bringing humor and giving a heart to a normally heartless character and Thompson gave one of the best villainous performances I've seen, also the performances Paul Walter Hauser and John McCrea were great. The makeup and hairstyling were phenomenal especially on Emma Thompson and Emma Stone. The sets were superb. The soundtrack is awesome, the song selection was perfect and original music was great. The only criticisms I have would be that the screenplay at times was a little cheesy and the visual effects specifically the Dalmatians were a little odd and not the best or most realistic looking but other then that it was a pretty perfect movie."

But.The film looks like a theatrical performance rather than a movie. The actors are a bit run-of-the-mill, but Emma Thomson is the best of the whole film.If you want to see a very good actress, you can watch the film, without Emma Thomson the film would be 4-5/10, but with Emma Thomson 8/10. The film is ok, acting by Emma Thomson is perfect... I would even go so far that she could get an Oscar nomination, that's how good I thought the acting was. The film itself is really something \"childish\", \"gloomy\" but a bit \"special\" in terms of quality, as I said, just because of Emma Thomson I give the film an 8/10..."

Alt-right: \"Disney is pushing the modern agenda!\" Cmon, this is not the universe of the Witcher or something! Black characters and gays are not in conflict with the fashion industry in England in the 70s. As well as the fact that women rule in this movie, which is based on the world of fashion. This movie was not about war, damn it! Personally, I'm against modern tradition to put black persons where they are unfit the lore. But this movie is not the case.2. Dog lovers: \"I like dalmatians, why she will try to skin them later? Her motivation is unclear.\"She sees dalmatians as tools that killed some1 she loved.She has the genes of a psychopath. She's obsessed with success in the wild fashion industry which leads her to become a psycho herself, achieving her goals at any cost.How TF can the motivation of a psychopath to make a fur coat out of someone she hates be unclear at all?3. Fantasy Haters: \"This Disney movie is for kids\"Oh, really? Disney, for kids? Who would ever guess!4. CGI Haters: Too much CGI!Agree."

Watch 101 Dalmatians."

      "text": "Great another Disney prequel movie about making a Disney villain sympathetic. That was my thought when I heard the announcement of this movie. I had no care about watching this as Disney have sucked with these live-action prequel/remake of Disney animated movies. I eventually decided to give it a watch as there was a fair amount of internet buzz, both positive and negative, that kind of made me want to watch it. So does Disney finally do it right or is does this skin the legacy of 101 Dalmatians?Firstly, Emma Stone does a phenomenal job as Cruella. I honestly thought no one would be able to live up to the performance by Glenn Close, who is also an executive producer on the movie, as Cruella but Emma Stone proved me wrong. Her performance was very stylish and cruel which is exactly what I want from Cruella. Emma does add another layer to the character in the heartfelt moments which does make her more sympathetic. Emma Thompson plays the antagonist, the Baroness, and she also delivers an amazing performance by being narcissistic and full of attitude. Every time Emma Thompson is on screen she just steals it. Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser also do a good job as Jasper and Horace respectively. They play the friends of Cruella and add a level of heart and fun to the movie that I really enjoyed.One of the best aspects of Cruella (2021) is the rivalry between the titular character and the Baroness. Seeing both of them compete in fashion war was surprisingly exciting to watch. Every scene with them together is tense, and this is thanks to both Emma Stone and Emma Thompson having great chemistry. I also really love how bold and dark the director, Craig Gillespie, went with it. There is violence, murder, attempted murder, attempted child murder and corruption that genuinely surprised me. There is also a twist near the end that I think was pretty good and I think a fair amount of people would not expect.Cruella (2021) is a visual spectacle thanks to the costume design by Jenny Beavan\u2019s. There are countless different and unique clothes throughout the movie that are stunning. We got the extremely over the top fashion from Cruella but we also got the elegant yet beautiful clothes of the Baroness. There are so many costume changes and they are all great yet perfectly represent the characters, it is quite an achievement from Jenny. The set design is also really well done and bring 1970s London to life. We get the gloomy city but the vibrant parties which all look stunning. The cinematography by Nicolas Karakatsanis is gorgeous and illustrates the party and costumes perfectly. One scene on the top of my mind is the Cruella catwalk which looked stunning thanks to the cinematography. Cruella also has a great music score by Nicholas Britell. The orchestral compose soundtrack works well for every scene and really captures the emotion of the moment. He also utilizes a 1970s pop soundtrack which you think would be annoying but it works so well here. Every song choice is used effectively and fits the scene that is occurring.  However, some scenes get slightly ruined thanks to the really bad CGI. The CGI is very noticeable, especially when it is the dogs which I don't get why they had to be CGI. There are scenes at night that are usually done to hide bad CGI but even that doesn't work to cover it up. Additionally, the story is very predictable for the most part and simply goes beat for a beat on a villain origin that is very formulaic. Disney has done the story beats for Maleficent and this goes the same way. The runtime is also 134 minutes which is very noticeable as there are some moments where the pacing slows down considerably. It could have cut down by at least 15 minutes while still retaining the core elements. There are issues with the screenplay with some lines feeling overly cringy or edgy that sound dumb and don't quite fit the tone of the movie. One big gripe I had was a dumb moment near the beginning to make Cruella sympathetic that was so stupid that I laughed even though it was not meant to be funny. It was just a really weird and dumb way to justify her hatred of the Dalmatians.Overall, Cruella (2021) surprised me a lot in how much I enjoyed it. It was to the point that I couldn't believe this was the same company that made Mulan (2020). Despite feeling there was no need to make a prequel on dog skinning lady even after finishing Cruella (2021), it's an excellent movie. It has gorgeous cinematography, stunning costumes and sets, a vibrant soundtrack with an amazing performance from Emma Stone and Emma Thompson. There is a lot to love in this movie which is why I believe that anyone who is still sceptical, should give Cruella (2021) a chance. It might surprise you."

      "text": "Doing for this human Disney villain what Angelina Jolie did for Maleficent, Emma Stone portrays a character who was once nothing but an evil character in a story that was a book, and then a film (sevearl times over) and now, she has her own origin story.Looking at the way things are, we're seeing these origin story films taking off. We've had it with Maleficent, We've had it with Joker and now we've got the one and only Cruella DeVil. While normally I am not one to go for milking characters from franchises, I can say this story was more dark and twisted than I expected. While it's not a film you could stick the youngest kids in front of, it's certainly one that is a nice nod to those of the generation who grew up with this classic character.There are a few changes that take you by surprise, such as how Cruella is not as heartless as she's seen to be in the story book or the original Disney animation classic, but she is shown to have a natural side of malice to her, which comes from her mother. Yet, the kindness in her comes from her father, which shines in her in the last minutes of the film.Emma Stone was someone I never would of personally pegged to play s uch a character, yet I am happily proven wrong by her amazing acting skills. Watching her on screen, she  takes you through several emotions ranging from cheering her on, to wondering if you really want to like her anymore, to feeling sympathy for her to feeling joy at her long overdue triumph.The film gives several nods to things people who know the original story of 101 Dalmatians, such as the three savage Dalmatians owned by the Baroness, the mention of how Cruella thinks they'd make a fantastic coat. The mention of how the car she obtains, which is pointed out by Horace to called a DeVil, is a name she likes so she adopts it as her last name. Then of course we get the appearance of Pongo and Perdita, the famous Dalmatian duo appearing in the final moments of the film.Overall, this film is a wonderful watch, one I could indeed watch again in a short while as it's just well done and good from start to finish. The only thing I feel is a little issue is how it panders to sme political correctness with some race changes, but it's not the worst thing.Other than that, it's a very emotional story telling of how one girl born different grows up thinking she needs to shun who she truly is to get anywhere. And only when  does she embrace those differences does her power shine through and she begins to become the Queen inside she knows she is. It's a bit of a classic tale, one which teaches you to that being who you are is the best thing to be. Though, this telling of that classic lesson twists it up by not hiding the fact that anyone can find bad parts to the true selves. It's down to deciding who you want to be is where you'll find out if you're good or bad.By the end of the film, it's really down to the viewer to decide whether if Cruella is as bad as she was originally shown to be, or if there's more to this character than we ever knew.Will there be a sequel? Knowing Disney, it's probably already in the works. But with what's been set up, there's a chance they could make it work. Do I want to see a sequel? I'm half and half on that. But only time will tell if it will happen and if it'll be any good if it does.The film is a 9/10. A win for Disney, hands down."

      "text": "Cruella trata de abarcar m\u00e1s de lo que puede resolver. Es m\u00e1s forma que substancia, con una fotograf\u00eda que es impactante y que te hace dudar si esto sucede en los 40s o los 70s y un vestuario por dem\u00e1s deslumbrante. Pero al final el gui\u00f3n cobra factura al entregar una historia demasiado gen\u00e9rica derivada de otras pel\u00edculas exitosas. De Cruella, como villana tenemos poco y lo de romantizar al villano, no lo entiendo. Aqu\u00ed no existe ninguno."
