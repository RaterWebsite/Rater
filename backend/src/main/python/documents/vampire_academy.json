Screenwriter  Daniel Waters and Director Mark Waters did not even the read the book by Richelle Mead (Author of \"Bloodlines\" series). Basically their making excuses to make a different story with the same characters but they a whole  lot of comparison from the Mean Girls characters. However i was entertained by the story also the mythology of  Vampire in Mead's world. The characters Lissa was an underdeveloped character played by actress  Lucy Fry. Speaking the cast their all terrible actors, some can act i guess? But i will read the series! Grade C+"

It revolves around 2 best friends (one a vampire and one her protector) who face all manner of challenges at the special school for their kind. All 3 of the funny lines are in the trailer. The rest is a mediocre blend of romance, magic and mystery. It never drags, but doesn't soar either. Young female fans of the book might enjoy it."

In theory this movie did everything right \"sorta\" they got a great director, the source material is very good and they cast in my opinion a very strong cast well suited for the roles. I do love mark waters and on the surface this movie was perfect for him a story about girls in a high school with vampires its not his fault for making the movie the way he does best it just wasn't the right movie for him. The things that make the book series so successful are the relationships between the characters and we didn't see enough of that due to the god awful pacing and the inner struggle and resilience of rose along with her determination to protect Lissa and that just never really came across. Did it fallow the plot points of the book sort of but it glossed over what should have been the focus the emotion and turmoil instead of the snarky remarks and attempts at memorable one liners none of witch i remember. It is that turmoil and relationship of rose and Lissa that makes it different from twilight or harry potter not making a twilight joke.\r As for the acting i do still believe Zoey Deutch was the right fit for rose i just don't believe she was given the direction or opportunity to show what she is capable of as an actress. she was a bit to detached but that appears to be how it was supposed to be but i still would have loved to see her be strong and vulnerable and use the snarky comments has a defense mechanism instead of the we have to tell everybody the story in as short of time as possible quick some one try to make a joke way in witch she was used. when she was given the opportunity it was a very good scene well half a scene due to pacing problem but not her fault. in the case of her costar Danila Kozlovsky i felt he did a fantastic job at portraying Dmitri and had great chemistry with Zoey but the relation ship in the movie felt like the rest of the movie feeling rushed and left me wanting more. Lucy Fry is another case of many in the movie where i feel her charecter didn't develop properly and was missed used due to time i wish i could have seen more of a supportive relationship between Lissa and Rose instead of using her mainly as a device to move the story along and explore her corrector more.\r over all i feel the acting wasn't bad just given wrong direction, the action scenes ranged from ridiculous to slightly above average, most scenes were way to short and were difficult to keep up with the story and i felt like the characters were trying to explain the scene to us. and did i mention the pacing. when a movie has this much back story and things to explain you cant rush it this movie if it had been done properly should have been twenty to thirty minutes longer as it stands it is still just a hodgepodge of could have been and almost's and just reeks of trying to make a quick buck on another popular YA novel instead of taking the time to dig just a bit deeper and truly do the book justice and make a good movie"

It felt like a very low budget movie, with the typical cringe worthy humor you always get in these teen chick flicks. I read the books when I was younger, waited eagerly for the next, I was completely hooked. I enjoyed them so much so finding out they had finally made a movie adaptation was really exciting, as I long awaited one at the time. It feels a lot more childish than the books, I would say to anyone read them before you watch the movie, or at least don't get a bad idea from this. The entire thing just felt very rushed, choppy, low budget and in all honesty... quite trashy. Highly disappointed."

The only thing I disliked was that Lissa's and Christian's personalities were different. Lissa wasn't as timid and Christian wasn't as sardonic and angry. I imagine in the eyes of someone who didn't read the books or much about the movie prior to seeing it, the biggest issue you will have is the pace and information overload. The only thing I thing that would have made it better were (as a book reader) fixing Christian's and Lissa's personalities and the fast-pace. I think it would have been worth it for them to have gone from 1 hour 40 minutes to 2 hours by using that extra 20 minutes to slow it down for everyone so the jokes and information could settle in the audience."

Not only will it satisfy the fans of the series but also the movie-goers.\r It has drama, comedy and romance. But unlike so many other teen movies. This focuses on friendship. The bond between to girls that leans on each other when no one else does.\rRemember when most of the fans are so worried that it will be like Mean Girls or that it has too much comedy in it? The movie has flaws but I can vouch that the movie is as much as possible very true to the book.\r Most of the cast was perfection. I\u2019ll admit I had doubts with Danila Kozlovsky playing Dimitri, our Russian God that we so badly wanted to be portrayed perfectly. And he did. He did it wonderfully. Danila Kozlovsky IS our Russian God.\r Zoey\u2019s take on Rose was spot on. She delivered all her comic lines smoothly.\r Lucy's acting was pretty cool too.\r Dom... He is perf.\r And Sarah, we all knew she will be an awesome Natalie and she delivered."

The acting is so much better than in Twilight  or Harry Potter (both films had excellent acting, and some very amateur acting). You don't have to have read the books to understand what's going on (not true in HP or Twilight). Can't wait for the sequel(s)."

Last Year, every YA movie (except Catching Fire) were not very good but at least I could read a little bit more about these books. Beautiful Creatures, The Host, The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones and Ender's Game all failed to find an audience and reviews were numb. Vampire Academy should be the next one to suffer because I really love the book series rather than watching a Mean Girls-like chick flick about two teenage students trying to find hidden secrets and dangerous paths of the Academy. The real problem was that it just wanted their attention and then fans just skipped the movie and see The LEGO Movie instead. Vampire Academy is pretty much the same and it has a tedious script, poor acting, make absolutely no sense to what the film is about (just in case you've already spend some time shopping at the mall). Wait a minute, is this the first movie from the director who jumpstart Mean Girls into a recipe for success? Yes, but that doesn't mean you want to make another one of the \"Twilight\" rip-offs. Fans could really enjoy the movie as often as they like, but I think Vampire Academy is one of the most disappointing movies of 2014."

Honestly if I hadn't read the book I don't think I would have watched it. They have tried to recreate a Mean Girls style film which is fine because the books are about high school drama but I don't think they sold it to anyone with the trailers and this approach.

I did enjoy every little turn out of the events even though I've read the books first. Normally I would always prefer the books to the movies but this one is exceptional I guess. I don't think it's just another cheesy vampire movie neither it is a twisted version of mean girls. It's totally different. Yeah maybe the trailer represented a twisted version of the movie but if you take a leap of faith and watch it, I'm pretty sure you'll like it. The characters were just perfect. I don't know why some people are **** about Zoey playing Rose and Danila playing Dimitri cause they were just incredible. You can see how hard they'd worked for their roles cause every little detail of the book matches. Sure it's not going to be everything like the books you have imagined to be but if you already know everything then what's the fun in that? And trust me when I say, you will not regret watching this movie even if you haven't read the books first cause it's just that incredible. And to some \"any kind of vampire movie haters\" Please don't compare it to Twilight cause it's nothing like that. Like a famous person once said, \"Don't judge the book by its cover\" I'm telling you not to judge the movie by its trailers. Watch it and then regret if you want to but don't do the other way around. The plots were perfect, there was humor, romance and action - All in one movie. I'm looking forward to watch the other sequels of this series so please stop **** and let them make other movie versions of the books. Don't spoil this for the people who have actually enjoyed the movie and are eager to watch the next part. Hell some of you have sat through the whole twilight series, so why can't you show a little bit support on \"Vampire academy\" which by the way is so much better than other typical vampire movies (no offense). And some of you people are complaining about the age thing, well you have the read the books right? So yeah the age gap is supposed to be noticeable. I don't think anyone could've done a better role than the actors and actresses of this movie themselves.\rSo in total, go watch the movie, you'll enjoy it. Even if you don't, don't spoil the chances of creating another sequel movie for those people who have loved it. Once again don't judge the movie by its trailers!! Enjoy!!"
