      "text": "Host is an enjoyable horror flick that seems cliched, and it definitely is, but with some novelties. The Zoom meeting part is attractive plus topical, and makes the whole viewing more delightful if you can relate with it. It's the usual story where a group of unsuspecting friends get together on an online call to hold seance and things go wrong. Just about an hour long (in line with Zoom's 40-minute free call version) and worth the watch. It won't disappoint. TN."

      "text": "Well then, I guess the glitch didn't just typed.So 'Host' is a horror \"movie\" that was filmed entirely using Zoom during the COVID-19 lockdown. Some spooky stuff happens with a demotic demon and one by one everybody is killed off. It's like 'Unfriended\u2019 but Zoom. There's also 2018 'Searching' starring John Cho, even though that isn't a horror movie. Basically, this concept of the whole movie taking place on a laptop or any online chat site isn't anything new. 'Host' doesn't add anything new to this concept and instead plays on predicable scares with no imagination behind it.This feels like one of those \"we need to get a movie out that's relevant with references to the outside world like masks, Covid, Zoom, etc.\" Zero artistic integrity, just boring and poorly put together. Just because its topical doesn't mean it's good.I thought it was poorly acted, as I didn't fully believe them as the characters. They don't talk or act like real people. It was just so awkward and unnatural, especially at the beginning which was so painful to sit through.The movie felt like a waste of time, despite the movie being 57 minutes long. I mean this is barely a movie. What's more insulting is that they added a seven-minute actual Zoom call with the cast and crew doing a seance, because I guess they wanted to pad out the runtime so it's feature length. Man **** this movie. The more I write and let things sink in, the angrier I'm getting.There was literally a scene when a demon throws a beer bottle at someone's head and it was so unintentionally hilarious that it came off as slapstick. I also noticed one of the actor\u2019s broke character at one point when one of sneeze during a serious and scary moment; I could see them holding back laughter before going back into scared and upset mood. It was so bad.The only positive thing I can say about this piece of **** is that at least it's short, even if it does end on a final jump scare, because we all know that great horror movies end like that.I wish my Zoom calls were as eventful as this."

      "text": "Se voc\u00ea espera algo criativo, que aprecie sua inteligencia, ou at\u00e9 mesmo uma nova abordagem do terror padr\u00e3o cinema pipoca, passe longe daqui.A obra come\u00e7a bem, incluindo elementos que aumentam a verossimilhan\u00e7a com o universo pand\u00eamico que eles tamb\u00e9m vivem, fora algumas referencias que foram bem vindas. O maior problema come\u00e7a com a abordagem do perigo. Como eu disse acima, se espera algo a mais que um terror pipoca, vai se decepcionar. Este longa pega conceitos super estabelecidos e os p\u00f5e numa abordagem digital. Bem, isso j\u00e1 foi feito antes em alguns filmes, como unfriended, e aqui n\u00e3o h\u00e1 nada de novo.H\u00e1 quem se divirta com dem\u00f4nios assustando - sem motivo aparente - adultos com a idade mental de 5 anos, mas algu\u00e9m tem de esperar algo desses filmes. N\u00e3o h\u00e1 um desenvolvimento sobre o enredo, \u00e9 apenas um certo tipo de ritual que deu errado, jump scares e jovens morrendo. Apesar de haver uma tens\u00e3o, por conta do cen\u00e1rio escuro e uso excessivo de jump scare's, o suspense n\u00e3o \u00e9 real pois n\u00e3o h\u00e1 atmosfera nem um desenvolvimento que leve a isso.  Depois de um tempo deixamos de levar a serio e fica por isso mesmo. A previsibilidade ajuda muito a apreens\u00e3o \u00e9 por \u00e1gua abaixo. H\u00e1 diversos clich\u00eas e nenhum deles vai te pegar de surpresa for real."

      "text": "The high praise this film has received is really the perfect reflection on what an awful year 2020 was for the movie industry. Literally a regurgitation of Unfriended and other films of that kind (social media call based). Just because it mentions covid and it's relevant to our current situation doesn't make it a good film. Minimal scares and when they do occur in its extremely short run time of 56 minutes  they are very predictable jump scares. Not for me, no discredit to the people who worked on this film, I just believe its current reviews have ballooned expectations"
