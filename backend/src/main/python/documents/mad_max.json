The concept is interesting and the cars and costumes are cool, but, as my son said, \"It's just a bunch of stupid action and everybody dies.\"  There's just no sense of a storyline.  It's one chase scene after another.  Not enough is done to develop the near-future setting.  The relationship between Max and his wife, which should be crucial to the plot, also isn't given time to develop.  All there are are chases.\r \"Max used to be a cop.

The originality leads to the world and characters keeping you involved even if the plot tends to meander a bit.\r With fantastic performances all around, some deranged villains, and violent scenarios it's definitely a darker piece of fiction.

HOWEVER, I understand the australian film scene was not big at this time and there were budget constraints, but it seemed like the script was pretty poorly written, and the plot of this film is pretty much pointless. This film was like an unintentional Mockingjay part 1, just being a set up for obviously what the real film he wanted to make was; The Road Warrior. The whole plot could've been put in as exposition in the second film withing 1 minute of screen time. The acting as well wasn't that high quality and Toecutter 'menacing' screams and mannerisms (along with a lot of the gang) were more worthy in something like a west side story film. Pretty bad film overall but i respect what he was 'trying' to do especially with a lack of australian cinema. I must say though, excellent practical effects for it's time, a real achievement there."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The first  film \"Mad Max\" over all was a hell of a good ride! what makes the film bad ass and beautiful is the action sequences also the story.

This is how a proper action film should be made with actors who can handle this material also a good direction, the action genre today is suffering. Mel Gibson's performance is heroic and bad ass! the way his character is written is caring and his character is fascinating; the writer's: James McCausland, George Miller put flavor also fastidious into the story. In a post apocalyptic world, an officer named Max who is committed to his job is on a high speed pursuit for the gang leader whom they called \"the knight rider,\" the gang leader is killed in a car crash (which Max is responsible for) the gang takes vengeance.

The first half of the movie is accually very slow and boring, with its boring dialogs and uninteresting plot. Mel Gibson as Mad Max is, even though he got some flaws, great for the role. But he wasn't as crazy as I expected to see in this post-apocalyptic movie. Most of the movie is in fact very boring, the story did not impress me! Mad Max is not as great as what I expected to see.

Oscar nominations, I wanted to catch up on things before seeing the new film at the Cineplex. I was very pleased with this early film in the post-apocalyptic movie category, and can see how and why both it and star Mel Gibson became so successful. Other than Kenneth Anger's experimental film, 'Scorpio Rising', I have never seen a work that so fetishes both cars and the ritual of dressing, either for driving or for war. It's very well directed and suspenseful for a first-timer in Miller, and I'm so glad he's still helming the films of the series 36 years later! All that one has to do to see How To and How Not To Continue a Fine Franchise is compare how both George Miller and George Lucas have done this century.

The first time was a few years ago. I saw it because it was one of those famous movies that I've never taken the time to watch. I must have been doing two things at once because I didn't quite get it. This time, I gave it my full attention and I think I understand it. At least, I understand it a little more. It still feels like a rather strange movie but I have a better idea of what happened.\r The movie opens to a post-Apocalyptic landscape, \"a few years from now...\" as the movie says. An understaffed police force is at war with criminals for control of the roads connecting the last pockets of civilization. A police cruiser parks alongside one such road. Suddenly, a female dispatcher's voice calls out an alert on the radio. A cop killer and his girlfriend have escaped custody, stolen a supercharged police cruiser and are on the run. The unit in pursuit needs assistance. The criminal\u2019s voice blares out on the radio, \"I am the nightrider!\" The two officers race off to join the pursuit. The nightrider continues to taunt and evade both cars. Goose, a motorcycle officer, briefly joins the pursuit before crashing. Throughout the chase, the camera cuts to an officer who sits alone in a cruiser. The mysterious man, steps out of his car, puts on dark sunglasses and dons a leather jacket and leather gloves with quiet, deliberate motions. This is Max (Gibson), the force's top officer. Once the criminal shakes off his pursuers, Max sets off to bring the man to justice. The two cars speed towards each other in a game of chicken. The cars nearly avoid a head on collision. The almost fatal encounter silences the once proud nightrider. Instead of shouting at the officer, he begins to cry. The two cars race over a hill at such speed the nightrider can\u2019t react fast enough to avoid an overturned fuel tanker blocking in the road. The nightrider's car bursts into a ball of fire and the sequence ends.\r The introduction of Mad Max is simple and to the point. It\u2019s a good indication of what the rest of the movie will be like. The focus of the movie is on cars and chase scenes. The story is present to make excuses for more chase scenes. That is, it isn't a sparse story with chase scenes but chase scenes with story spread throughout. It isn't quite to the level of focus as the original Gone in 60 Seconds (which features a 40 minute chase scene) but it is still enjoyable. On some level, for a short hour and a half movie, I might say that the film tries to accomplish too much. After all, it takes some time to establish Max's wife and infant son, and his friend named Goose, and the nightrider\u2019s gang, and the police force, and so on but the pace of the movie is consistent enough that this doesn't become much of an issue.\r The vehicles and characters are equally stylized. For example, you have the one nameless couple driving in a 1959 Chevolet Bel Air with fur interior and an elaborate flame paint job. Similarly, you have the police captain, Fifi; a tall man with a billowy voice and a thick moustache wears leather pants and no shirt while he waters his little plants. The style reminds me of the colorful gangs in The Warriors where you have the baseball gang and the roller skating gang. There isn't really a reason for cars and characters. I mean, this is the post-apocalyptic future, right? How much time, money, and energy did they spend on making these cars? Shouldn't these people be worried about food? Mad Max is just one of those movies where you have to go with the flow.\r I'd recommend this movie for a Friday evening or Saturday afternoon. It is simple and to the point."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Mad Max is a good movie.

Mel Gibson is really young in his role of Mad Max Rockatansky, that said he's 21 when he got the role and can drive and chase down the motorcycle gang. The gang leader, Toecutter and his gang harasses and assaults people including Max's girlfriend, Jessie. But nothing truly exciting happens until we get to the third act where Max takes revenge on the Toecutter and the motorcycle gang including Johnny the Boy. Now let me get to the different language to English and English in Australian. Many people didn't bother changing different languages or the fact they do, you can hear the difference between American and Australian. Years ago when people watch Mad Max they watched it and they loved it but revealing what is wrong when they change the language to Australian. Me and they found out that they recognised Mel Gibson's voice and not in the American language. Hahahahahahahahaha! I mean you just can't make this s%!t up at this point. It's so f\u00a3$king weird.

The effort and hard work that went on creating the future world pays off and the primary reason to that would be its accuracy and lunacy towards the resemblance with practicality which is not created to please the viewers but stand on its definite ideology. It is rich on technical aspects like choreography of all the chase sequences, background score, sound effects, art design and editing. The script is unpredictable, thought-provoking and goose-fleshing filled with nail-biting action sequences and three dimensional characters that are perfectly cooked and served to the audience. The screenplay by James McCausland and George Miller (the director) keeps the audience engaged with unexpected twists and turns and mind-shattering visuals where Miller's brilliant execution not only supports but celebrates it into a whole new level.
