      "text": "A man who runs an orphanage in Mexico (Jimmy Gonzales) is faced with closing down unless he can raise a lot of money. As the plot would have it, there\u2019s a big prize fishing tournament in the area and a group of his boys becomes the crew for the crusty captain (Dennis Quaid). There\u2019s a sweet energy with the kids providing a smidgen of personality, but the earnest approach and simple, predictable story might appeal to young audiences and their families. Interestingly, the film is set in Mexico but even the natives speak English with occasional lapses into Spanish, which makes no sense."

      "text": "due to lack of decent movies in netflix which vulgar words, sex and drugs gun, this is actually quite decent. we watched to see dennis quaid again. now he is just old and grumpy and wrinkled..... robert redford?it was quite heart warming and not cheesy because it touched on very relevant subject of the 'proud poor' mentality. we were shocked that there are still angels in this torn world to put up with caring for the less fortunate, when the rest are suffering just as much.the only heartache are the poor marlins, especially the one they dumped back into the sea... making us wonder whether it's a true story after all."
