Most of the acting was good, but some was just lousy.\rSome clever, effective kills.  I just wasn't scared watching this film.  Too much sarcasm from the characters, I guess.

Jason is my favorite slasher from the 80's.  So hearing that they were going to remake the Friday movies got me hyped, a lot.  Perhaps a little too much though, as when I left the movie theater, I was a bit disappointed.  Now I own the movie on Blu-ray so that disappointment didn't last long.  If you liked the other Friday sequels like part 4, then you will probably like this movie.  It's cheesy, slasher fun, full of obnoxious **** that need a good axe to the face.

Best part of the movie are the scenes with boobies in them, and I assure you, calling them \"boobies\" is a bit more accurate than calling them \"breasts\".

Compared with the endless onslaught of horror remakes, this file is pretty comparable, but that's not saying alot as most of these remakes offer very little of anything new, and lack the intensity and effectiveness of the originals. Friday the 13th is no exception. I will say that they did a good job with Jason and there were some good kills in this movie. F13 fans will be pleased at the usual amount of gratuitous fornication taking place in this film (a trademark of F13 movies), but those bells and whistles are the only resemblance to the original movies. Gone are the intense music (even during action/murder scenes), the witty humor, and the charasmatic characters. F13 2009 is nothing more than a shell of Sean Cunningham's original classic. Not the worst movie I've ever seen (I've seen some doosies) but quickly forgotten once I was done watching it. Yawn."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Friday the 13th is a decent remake of a decent original. This slasher movie is nowhere near as bad as other modern horrors and slashers that destroyed the genre but that doesn't make it a very good movie. The script could have been a lot better, contained a lot more substance than it did and porbably went something like - Man in mask kills teen one, kills teen two and continues killing teens until he eventually fails, dies and somehow comes back to life but it's the varying amount of ways he kills his victims that redeem this movie, slightly."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Why do people say in many horror remakes \"This isn't as bad as Friday the 13th remake.\" What is it about this one that is so terrible? I watched all 11 Jason movies and this REBOOT, not remake. If this was a remake, then Jason wouldn't be in this one. Anyways, what I hear most is \"The guy doesn't even look like Jason Voorhees.\" Let's describe him shall we, this was before he was a zombie so we're looking at Part 2-4. He has a disfigured head, wears a sack on his head till he gets a hockey mask, and he carries a machete. In the remake, he looks just like that. \"The other characters are stupid and are meant to die.\" Guys, did you even watch the other movies...in fact, have you seen any slasher movies? Every character in the Friday the 13th movies are all disposable for Jason to kill, except the main character. This takes place in Crystal Lake, just like the original movies. Jason takes his time killing people, just like the original movies. Most importantly, Jason didn't die. Do I have to mention about the original movies again?

I loved the first 2 movies, but they were not suspenseful, they were just hack and slash.

The acting wasn't great but padalecki and righetti as the leads were very good as well as ms. panabaker. The rest served their purpose. Mears as Jason was among the best to ever play him. The visuals were specatcular and I was very impressed with the whole movie. The beginning was awesome and grabbed my attention and held throughout the whole thing. Nispel did a great job directing and a horror movie has to be pretty good for me to take the time to post a review b/c most of the newer horror movies and remakes have been terrible, I love the Halloween movies more than any other but this was much better than the halloween remake and I really liked what Rob Zombie did with that film but Friday the 13th was much better.
