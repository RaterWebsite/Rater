      "text": "Does anyone at Paramount Pictures have an original bone in his or her body anymore, or was having them all surgically removed a prerequisite for employment? Their entire roster of motion pictures over the last year seems to have consisted solely of remakes of past successes (Alfie, The Longest Yard, War of the Worlds, The Bad News Bears) that, to a one, served only to remind everybody of how terrific the originals were (...and maybe prompt people to purchase them on DVD? Hmmmmm! I guess I have to take it all back; great business strategy, guys!) At any rate, the hits just keep on getting regurgitated: the latest is John Singleton's present-day urban variation on the competent but forgettable 1965 John Wayne/ Dean Martin/ Earl Holliman/ Michael Anderson Jr. western The Sons of Katie Elder, with Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund as one-time seriously troubled youths who are taken under the wing of a beneficient woman who sets them right--but not SO right that they're unable to exact a notably bloody, streetwise revenge on her killers. (In an unintentionally funny piece of dialogue comparing the four antiheroes now to what they would've been had they not been rescued from a life of crime, it's explained that even though they still have plenty of rough edges, they're congressmen compared to what they once were. Huh? In whose fantasy world is a congressman an example of angelic behavior?) The one improvement Singleton makes on the original is that he actually shows the mom--warmly played by Fionnula Flannigan--whereas in the original she had died before the film began and was represented onscreen by her rocking chair. The problem is that Singleton doesn't show ENOUGH of her; the real story, I think, is in what this exceptional woman did to get her self-appointed charges on the right path. But then, I'm not sure that either Singleton knows himself or is all that interested; after she's murdered, the guys mostly drink, screw and stuff themselves with Thanksgiving dinner, and you'd think they'd lost a stray cat that had been hanging around rather than the number one influence on their lives. The actors playing the foursome seem to frequently be acting in different movies; only on rare occasions do they give the impression of being brothers at all--real, adopted or whatever. Remember when a frequent (if often unjustified) criticism of Singleton's post-Boyz N The Hood work (Poetic Justice, Higher Learning, Baby Boy) was that he was trying too hard? Would that the good old days were back: the bulk of Singleton's recent work, from the smoothly-made remake of Shaft to the unashamedly trashy sequel 2 Fast 2 Furious to this, has been slickly made but increasingly lazy and machine-tooled, and this relentlessly routine urban bloodbath is the weakest of the lot. It's all sensation, no resonance: the central message poignantly proclaimed at the end of the groundbreaking Boyz N the Hood was \"Increase the Peace\"; Singleton's philosophy in Four Brothers seems to have morphed into \"Make the Blasts Last\"."

      "text": "Well I have to say it sounds like there's some Four Brothers pushin peeps in here trying to sell the movie! I went into it with an open mind and appreciated the plot idea but it soon began to deteriorate. What gets me is why there was such unrealistic stuff put in to ruin the experience when it didn't have to. Like the Store having the Video of the shooting! The Cops would have had it! Also, pulling a gun out during the basketball game and all those witnesses and no one called the cops! These guys are on parole! Also, you guys are talking about there not being any shooting! Are we talking about the same movie? I thought the directing and acting was decent except for Jack the tatooed guy man he was bad (MOMMY) LOL. If there adopted mother was such a great inspiration and role model then why did they turn out so bad! She would have never agreed with what they did! Also, the cops did a lame job at the investigation of the four brothers (Self Defense) LOL! It was funny how they always stayed one step ahead of the cops. If you watch reality shows like \"The First 48\" on A&E, you would see real life! This movie is typical Hollywood run and gun, over the top, and unrealistic. I'd rather watch Training Day. Pietra, none of this could happen especially with four parolles. And Kiro, I appreciate your opinion but I totally disagree."

This is a PLAIN AND SIMPLE FUN MOVIE. Some good action, funny moments between characters, and the best plot Hollywood has produced for a while (which isn't saying much, but it's a good plot). The violence isn't over-the-top like other hollywood revenge films like Man-On-Fire. Don't take four brothers serious -- it's not a realistic/serious film, but it's not a comedy. A great boys night movie with mates. So fill up your Jerry can with gas, and get ready for a good night's entertainment. :)"

Four Brothers is an epic tale and should be praised for its bravery to go out into Hollywood and give it something that isn't your classic excuse for guns and fists! The sacred bond between brothers, the display of love and affection that four ex-convicts carry for a loving woman, isn't that something that you should see and say, \"Hey, this isn't cliche. This is the type of material that isn't all gangster shooting, isn't war, and especially isn't a hatred-revenge filled movie.\" Appreciate a fine movie when you see it, and I speak to every critic out there who doesn't appreciate this movie for what its worth, and realize the brave step the producers took into making a movie that wasn't made for the sake of violence."

It's a totally engrossing and powerful action drama that will have you on the edge of your seat, and also at the same time making you feel the pain the mercer boys' feel. This movie from producer/director John Singleton goes to show you just because you don't look anything alike, doesn't mean your not brother's. I very highly recommend this movie."

It does, however pick up towards the middle third and by the end it has reached full throttle. The gritty realism of the story is enhanced by the winter scenes on the streets of Detroit. I can\u2019t say I was overly enthused by the choice of music throughout, but then it\u2019s not really my scene man. The performances were all excellent with Mark Wahlberg and Tyrese Gibson taking most of the spotlight, but I thought nobody put a foot wrong throughout. Over all a gritty realistic and sometimes brutal revenge thriller. Maybe a little too slow for some in the beginning but the pace does pick up (I promise).\r SteelMonster\u2019s verdict: RECOMMENDED\r My score: 7.2/10"
