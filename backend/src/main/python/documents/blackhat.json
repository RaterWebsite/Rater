This conjures the feeling of alienation and that I am nothing but a drop of water in the ocean with my own little life.\r Point 2 - the problem. Thor actor is all beef cake and perhaps limited in convincing me he is intelligent enough to be a hacker yet I like Chris Hemsway - as though I know him personally in the same way I feel I know Tom Hanks (the master).\r Point 3 - in comparison to the odd worthwhile movie I watch at the flicks this is worth the ticket money. The panoramic scenes does achieve a lot  and gives that sensory experience of 'lost in the vast buzzing city which could be any modern city in the world (Box ticked) and this is MM hallmark.\r Point 3 - again (why not since the movies keep doing part 2s an 3s?). Birdman, Theory of Everything and Whiplash  - the only great movies of 2015 so far. Outstanding. This does not hold candle to them but comparing the multitude of drivel I have watched in recent years at least I don't regret parting with my hard earned dosh.\r Verdict: decent enough to view at the flicks, particularly for the visual style of MM."

Unfortunately, it quickly turns into a typical Bourne-type actioner with a few keystrokes thrown in. Chris Hemsworth plays a jailed hacker, whose brought out of jail and onto the case to track down the criminal who's already caused a nuclear disaster. There's a lackluster love interest that slows down what little momentum that exists. Nothing about the approach or the writing is original and the sluggish pace isn't augmented by any of Mann's visual style."

      "text": "There's no sugar coating it, Blackhat is terrible. It has agonizingly slow pace, stupid logic and a barrage of tech lingo which withers your will to watch it till the end. It's surprising that this is the work of Michael Mann who produced much superior film, Collateral, more than a decade ago. Chris Hemsworth as lead is willing, he makes the best out of his character, even if it seems he's lost most of the time.\r The story revolves around a cyber terrorist attack on Hong Kong nuclear plant. Chris Hemsworth, because his screen name isn't memorable enough, is called to consult on apprehending the hacker responsible for this act. At first glance this is supposed to be cerebral endeavor, but it does not even come close. In fact, regular mundane investigation requires arduous effort. Finding the simplest clues will take five minutes of narrative, and this is done with incredibly alienating script. Plenty of terms that might not be familiar to audience, and even if that's not an issue, the movie repeats itself too many times without adding much.\r There is no satisfying master plan, or even basic plan at all. Characters make the bad decisions such as not taking cover in fire fight or doing illicit deed in public, these are supposed to be agents sent to resolve international incident and mastermind behind it. In no realistic realm these scenarios could work, but they stupidly do, only for the sake of the plot. It disappoints in every turn, after all the nifty computer screen, I daresay Fast & Furious 5 plan of dragging bank vault makes more sense.\r If the movie does anything right, it's the use of setting and cinematography. Michael Mann has a certain style which produces an authentic feel of any place the characters play in. Some scenes extenuate the long pace with unbridled view of buildings and the city. Unfortunately, with such thin substance it feels like a long boring drive at best."

      "text": "I was let down by 'Blackhat', a movie from one of my favorite directors (Michael Mann) that seemed to have an interesting story that had relevance in the real world from the wake of the recent Sony hacks and the rise in cyber crimes that are perpetrated more and more in recent days. However, the plot moves at an excruciatingly slow pace that would challenge even the most attentive viewer from falling asleep. There are multiple scenes that have no importance to the story that should have been cut out, it's like the movie was still on the editing table when it was sent to theaters. There are a few good things about it, the gunfights were gritty and non exaggerated proving that Mann can still do decent gun play that is more accurate opposed to the infinite clip that we are used to seeing in many other movies, the cinematography is also very good and it was really nice to just look at the beautiful landscapes and backgrounds of the locations they filmed in Hong Kong and Jakarta. The acting was a very mixed bag considering most of the main characters are miscast i mean come on Thor as a hacker come on, Viola Davis was the best part of the movie as the no nonsense Carol Barrett and it seemed she was the only one trying here. My main fret with this movie is the Antagonist, he is never given the treatment that past Mann antagonists had. In 'Collateral' we had Tom Cruise give an excellent performance as Vincent, and in 'Heat' Robert DeNiro gave another fantastic performance as Neil McCauley. What both of these characters have in common is that they are written terrifically. In Blackhat, not so much. The antagonist is not only miscast, but is written without an objective and there is no reason given for him to cause destruction other than 'just because'. Blackhat is a competently directed but slackly written thriller that will most likely bore audiences than thrill them."

I will summarize as follows - hunky computer geek with insane personal combat skills (???) catches an international cyberterrorist and walks away with enough money to live lavishly forever with his new, hot girlfriend.  With that being said, there is a gunfight or two and NOBODY stages a gunfight like Michael Mann.  I mean no one...that was a great scene.  The rest of the movie?  Meh...\r Here's the deal - the plot is absolutely braindead.  The plot twist (spoiler) is that the earlier hacks are a test run to destroy some tin mines and make a killing on the futures market.  BUT...the hacker can apparently manipulate future markets anyway (that's how he got his front money), so why bother with the Tin scheme?  Why not just do that Chicago Mercantile Exchange hack over and over again?  Because Thor needs to kick some ass, that's why.  I guess.  I dunno.  Just seems like the \"surprise\" is nothing more than a repeat of the beginning of the movie.\r Very disappointing.  I suspect Mr. Mann's next one will be great.  For every Heat, he makes an Ali.  For every Collateral he makes a Blackhat.  Next one has to be fantastic, right?"

      "text": "Where to begin brief intro. One this review only reflects first 30 minutes as I couldnt watch anymore 2 I generally feel critics are too harsh on some movies they rate poorly. I have reviewed films myself in the past and used to work for a movie theater I love movies and will generally watch anything I am even remotely interested in regardless of whether I think it is reviewed well or not. I am a firm believer of never walking out of a movie before it ends giving the full runtime to the film to come out with an accurate review. I am being a hypocrite right now this movie is godawful I couldn't watch another second of it. That is enough of an intro on to the actual review.\r In the first 30 minutes next to nothing happens now if this was setting up the origin of the story or characters that is fine I really dont mind when a movie starts with a slow pace but there is a difference between a movie with a slow pace and a movie that does almost nothing in the first act of the film. Here are some random things that happened. Someone causes a virus to infect chinese nuclear systems to cause a core to overmelt. This is expressed in two ways a 5 minute scene of data running through wires in what is some of the worst cg I have ever seen in a film and actors staring dramatically at eachother with a few nods. A hacker looks at the code of what happened and angrily slams his laptop closed and pushes some paper off his desk. Chris Helmsworth character helped create the code so he is negotiating his terms.\r You have good actors giving bad performances with bland dialogue you have more solemn stares you have more crappy cg sequences of data going through wires.\r Very little emotion is shown by anyone no explanation is given as to what type of hack it was what terms they are throwing about with no definitions.\r I have a basic understanding of cyber attacks and hacking not a great one not a nonexistant one but at least in the 30 minutes I saw if you are interspersing horrible cg with random hacking terms and not explaining anything to the audience that is just poor planning\r This is the 3rd movie I have walked out of in my life One I was sick and had to leave for as a child one was premonition with sandra bullock and now this one in my 29 year obsession with cinema I have seen around 500 films in theaters. Normally I feel critics grade a film too harshly if it isn't an oscarbait film currently I simply find nyself dumbfounded by any critics giving this film higher then a 20 on a 100 point scale. I have watched so many crappy movies all the way through where I knew it was a bad movie but I just kept watching it to able to give a fair judgment. This one is so bad it doesnt deserve the full runtime.\r If a film is 2 hours and nothing has happened in the first 30 minutes? That is a problem. I am not saying nothing cool or exciting happened I am literally saying nothing happens. Again bad cg animation hacker terms with no explanation and good or at least decent actors giving godawful performances. I havent written a review for a movie on metacritic in years I logged in simply to write this urging you not to waste your money. One of the worst movies I have started tk watch in the last 10 years. Transcendencd is godawfuk as well but ironically the first 20 minutes of that was good."

Hopefully, he will make more great movies in the future, and Blackhat will be forgotten, or remembered only as an example of how even talented filmmakers can occasionally turn out total crud.

The \"hacking\" itself will look ridiculous to anyone with even a modicum of Linux skill or network security know-how.

I could not wait for it to be over, same with other stupid cliche action movies.  While Blackhat on the other hand is not perfect, and it it very similar in feel and tone to Mann's other films, it is a decent film, which kept me guessing, kept me engaged, and had pretty good character development and was overall a pretty good movie on a subject that does not have many films made about it yet.  I would rate it as one of Mann's weaker films, but, even as possibly Mann's worst film (for being similar to his others) its still much better than most of the crap pumped out by Hollywood today."

The story of bringing a hacker out of prison to help save the rest of the world from another hacker feels a little convoluted and weird. The action in the movie was done right, Gun fire is loud and bullets rips through the environment and makes you feel like it's not just blanks being fired.Sadly beyond that there wasn't much else I found stood out from the rest the mediocre story and un-needed love interest just pulled me away from the film.

They are good to very good, but I am not in love with him as a director. However, I do like all of his films. Why? As exemplified in Blackhat, they are visually stunning. This film looks like a Michael Mann directed film with some killer cinematography, great lighting, and Mann's typical visual style. A timely an exciting, even if far-fetched, plot surrounds the stunning visuals and it most certainly entertains and thrills along the way. People tend to really not like this film (as evidenced by a 34% approval rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes and 24% from the audience), but I really enjoyed Blackhat.

The music, atmosphere, and cinematography are all painfully good. Sure it's not a super-deep story (though by the end it succeeds at transcending the basic \"will they catch the bad guy\" premise it starts out with), but it has heft and craftsmanship like a Kimber 1911.
