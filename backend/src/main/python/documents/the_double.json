The plot wanders about; giving away very key information far too early (IMO) and taking all the mystery out of it for me. Yes, there is a twist at the end, but by that time I\u2019m just pissed off with it. It\u2019s well shot with most of the action taking place in and around Washington DC. It was nice to see Martin Sheen as CIA director Tom Highland; it was kinda odd seeing him in Washington & not being the President. Over all, a film that failed to live up to expectations; I know which direction I would have taken it in and that would have been a much better story.\r SteelMonster\u2019s verdict: NOT RECOMMENDED\r My score: 5.7/10"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "The Double has some fun cat & mouse spy action. Beyond that, there's not too much to say. The movie suffers from being a bit generic but it's a decent night's entertainment."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Talk about jumping the shark! \"The Double\" gives away a plot twist in the first twenty minutes of the movie! What a rookie mistake. Although that sort of move might actually pay off for its creativity in better movies, \"The Double\" doesn't pay off at all. Richard Gere and Martin Sheen give good performances, but Topher Grace tries way to hard. He tries to give his character more depth and gravitas but he fails miserably. \"The Double\" can try to be all it wants but the truth is that it's a hollow spy thriller with good intentions but bad execution."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "To be honest, this movie is not exactly a movie that I can watch over and over again.
