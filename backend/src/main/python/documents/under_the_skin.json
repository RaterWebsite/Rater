I was always excited for this film, but this is just above and beyond what I could have imagined. This film is not for everyone because it's so incredibly arthouse, but I honestly think that if people talked about the film, they'd see it in a new light.\r Virtually nothing here is meant to be taken literally; it's extremely symbolic. It's an allegorical trip that is haunting, intriguing, sublime, gorgeous, sad, different, strange, human, spellbinding, unforgettable, and masterful, utilizing all of these qualities that convey what it means to be a human. What is also is about, though, is reveling in the questions and finding answers.\r The cinematography is immaculate and the sound design is incredible. The score is mesmerizing and perfectly complements the visuals and tone of the film, with its strings and screechy sounds crossing into the realm of being sound effects at some points, and that's great because like the film, it brings together all senses and experiences into one odd package. Scarlett Johansson is intoxicating, doing so much with so little dialogue. She uses her eyes and facial expressions and callousness-turned-fake-charm so well, and you forget that you're watching an actress work because it's so immersive and shockingly realistic.\r I can see why some people would dislike this film because it is very alienating (no pun intended) and probably as far from mainstream as you can get, but it's also so engrossing. This is a film that gives no explanations and doesn't really have much of a setup that leads into a conflict that sets the movie into action in a traditional sense. It works wonderfully because the movie itself feeds off of our abilities - as humans - to interpret emotions and read other individuals. The movie even seems to be watching you back at times.\r Jonathan Glazer demonstrates that he has such a huge talent but also a great deal of discipline in order to make everything work. In the hands of another director, everything would have crumbled into pieces, but because it's so well-made, he makes connections between humanity and sexuality, objectification and death, and, to a certain extent, gender roles.\r The ending (without spoiling anything) both satisfies and leaves ample room for interpretation, and is very affecting. There is a good amount of emotion to this film, and it's just so commendable that a film like this could be so human and realistic. I can definitely see the comparisons to Kubrick (my favorite director ever) and I could compare this film to Eraserhead and 2001: A Space Odyssey, and partially to Eyes Wide Shut.\r This is a movie that I will never be able to forgot, and I know for a fact that I'll be thinking about it obsessively for a very long time. This may be one of my favorite films ever.\r 9.7/10, masterful, two thumbs up, miles above average, etc."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Picked this up tonight because it was $11 at my local MovieStop in addition to the awesome reviews and interesting plot. If you're just wondering if it's good or bad and don't wanna read a review I'll tell you, in short, yes it is good, but it's certainly not for everyone.\r The movie itself begins with something similar to a 2001-Esque intro. The pacing is very slow, and is hard to keep the casual moviegoers attention, but to art movie fans, there are plenty of symbolic and artistic qualities shown throughout. There are only a few words spoken but the images are very interesting. They sort of give this movie a dreamy quality. Now with all of that said, there isn't much else to say. I probably would've enjoyed it more had I known what to expect, because I certainly wasn't expecting to see what I saw. There is lots and lots AND LOTS of nudity so this isn't a family-gathering type of movie. My friend and I enjoyed it, although the reviews are a bit too high. My sister, who is more casual with movies absolutely loathed it. I say go for it if you're feeing whimsy. It's an interesting piece to say the least."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Stunning experience - weird, intriguing, mysterious, brilliant, provoking, masterpiece.  The audio/sountrack is a key driver in completing the film's visuals and beautiful cinematography.  The acting is spot on - love the natural feel of the victims and Scarlett is brilliant (although I would say there's an imbalance of character when she becomes scared at the end - thinking she should be tougher than humans). McWilliams is totally creepy and perfect, and his biking skills are insane!  In one scene where the camera is following him he's pulling away on the camera/car on curvy wet roads and they're going fast...awesome scene, got my heart pumping.  They style of this film is similar to Kubrick eerie 2001 and Eyes Wide Shut.  I went into watching this film without a shred of knowledge, and I plan to watch it again - love the soundtrack and audio -  absolutely eerie and feels out of this world. Beautiful Scotland scenes, touches many human emotions, lots of symbolism, it'll make you think, draw your own conclusions. Highly recommended for those who love contemporary art and film, and have an open mind.  Only drawback is wish it was longer.  Can't wait for director Jonathan Glazer's next film -- 10/10"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "A Sci-Fi horror film methodically shot in ways that pay homage to the genres classics, but misses both the lore and revulsion necessary to justify much appraisal.  The \u201cfill in the blank\u201d story route seems more ignorant and apathetic than artistic or thought provoking.  Aliens in human skin is not so revolutionary a concept that it needs much explaining (just examine any politician), but to the degree that Scarlett\u2019s character knew English, how to drive, how to walk, possessed property, rationalized target selection, knew how to seduce, etc., I couldn\u2019t help but wonder what backstory must exist in order for any of that to seem slightly plausible in its fictional world without simultaneously contradicting Scarlett\u2019s jejune character.  Alternatively, the poor backstory may have been overlooked if the horror aspect of the film was stronger.  Outside of seeing a dude get his organs Criss Angel\u2019d, red goop on a slide (artsay symbologay!!!), babies being Tarzan\u2019d (beginning of crab people?), and perverts, for an alien horror movie this is located fairly low on the terror spectrum.  I think it is worth noting that Johanssan\u2019s hidden camera improv was good, but her awkward attitudes manifested in a fairly unnatural or disingenuous way (awkwardly acting awkward-ception).  Also, why was nudity a thing?  Naked people still= artsy?  Seemed more like eye candy for boner grins instead of an honest illustration of on the surface beauty.  Overall, certainly not a bad movie, especially for its genre, but personally I did not find it all that great either (less is not always more).  Maybe robot instead of alien (perhaps a bit easier to explain)?  Illuminati confirmed\u2026"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I was mesmerized the entire movie.  Thank God for directors that don't rely on a heavy classical soundtrack that annoys and distracts.  Natural noises, such as wind blowing, footsteps, clocks ticking are far more effective.  When music was used it was creepy and atmospheric.  The bleak Scottish cityscapes and natural beauty only added to the atmosphere.  There are scenes in the film I will never forget.  I thought Scarlett Johansson was terrific, although I'm already a big fan of hers.  I don't need a complete story tied up in a bow for satisfaction, this little slice of Sci Fi was excellent.  My only small critiques was that the story of an alien or robot becoming sympathetic to humans has been done before many times, and the Scottish accents were so heavy I couldn't understand some of the dialogue, but it was not distracting enough to ruin my enjoyment.  Not for everyone but if it is your style you will love it.  A director to watch for sure."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I remember there being a lot of hype for this. Not because people were excited for another deep, thoughtful sci-fi movie or anything like that, but because Scarlett Johansson was going to be naked. When it finally came out I saw that it got good reviews, but nobody really talked about it after that. So I assumed that everybody masturbated then moved on with their lives and that I wouldn't be missing anything by skipping it. It wasn't until a few years later that someone I met online recommended it to me and I decided that I might as well check it out at some point. I have ended up glad that they convinced me to look past my misconceptions and give it a shot.The premise of an alien seductress leading men to their deaths with the promise of sex sounds like it should be the basis for a movie where the sole appeal is in the nudity. Not something as dark and haunting as this. Under the Skin has a B-movie setup, but ended up with art house appeal. The cinematography is gorgeous. Watching Johansson drive around in a van and do almost nothing is way more entertaining than it should be. Not just because of how great Jonathan Glazer and Daniel Landin were able to make the mundane look, but also because of Johansson herself. Her stare that is both empty, but full of curiosity is mesmerizing. You really want to get inside of her character's head just as much as all these men want to get inside her pants.It's a very vague movie. Perhaps intentionally so that viewers may be able to draw their own conclusions as to what it's about. Loneliness from a true outsider's perspective? Trying to find your place in a cold world? A celebration of individuality? A critique of men's harassment and objectification of beautiful women? Even something as simple as real beauty being on the inside? I couldn't quite say. All I know is that it's a movie that is able to overcome most of the boredom one would typically find in something this slow-paced thanks to a wonderful performance from it's lead actress and that I enjoyed it very much."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This film is visually beautiful, with it's eerie atmosphere with deception theough seduction looming over so many scenes.

I never expected to be immersed watching this movie as its plot slowly unveils itself.\r There might have been many interpretations what this movie is about so in my own interpretation, the story is told from an alien humanoid point of view of what human life is like and how she tries to adapt the world around her. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this is what the movie is trying to tell.\r The best part about this movie was its direction and cinematography. It\u2019s what made this movie worth my time to watch thanks to its eye appealing cinematography. Not to forget is the score of this movie in which enhances the movie experience for me so much that it literally gave me chills in the backbone.\r Scarlett Johansson played her role brilliantly in a very ambitious art house movie. She is a very good listener on what the director wants her to do and she had a good improvise timing on many scenes where she has to improvise. She shows that she isn\u2019t just some actress with a pretty face, she is a serious actress who will do what\u2019s tasked to her.\r Under The Skin is a great art-house movie with great performance and on screen presence of Scarlett Johansson and eye-appealing cinematography and direction but this movie is not for everyone to see."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A very interesting film about the humanization of an alien. It's quite bizarre what we see on screen and because of that people might dislike it but after the script is being developed you learn how to enjoy it. It's not a typical ET film with a weird creature and a lot of action since Glazer focus on Johansson's killings (they're not violent as you might think) and how she starts to change after a a long time on Earth. With an incredible score, Under the Skin is an amazing film about an alien who starts recognizing itself as a human being and trying to live and act like one. Johansson is magnificent!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Although I found it to be a tad more puzzling than need be to convey such a simple tale, the imagery pays off in silver dollars.  Scarlett plays a very sterile creature and although its' one of her most low on dialogue roles, actions speak louder than words in this beautifully twisted tale of morality."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Under the Skin is a supurb art-house sci-fi flick that is completely devoid of hand-holding. It's a bleak and beautiful vision featuring truly eye-catching cinematography. After watching the movie I just couldn't stop thinking about it.

Under the Skin is an excellent film."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I've never been so upset by the last 40 minutes of a film in my life.  Compound that with the amount of people literally implying such ridiculous notions as, \"you probably just didn't understand everything going on in the film- that's why you didn't like it.\"  No.  No I understood what was going on, and it was fairly obvious by about an hour into the film.  Up until that hour I was actually enjoying it, I saw it as a sort of abstract thought experiment film that tried to convey the mind of a female serial killer femme fatale- and my goodness realizing what this film WASN'T gonna be about was far more shocking by the time I ultimately reached the miserable ending.  You wanna know what obvious imagery they put in this film for people pretentious enough to tell you its a film that involves multiple viewings?  Ant on her hand, the ant is human beings!  Fly on the glass trying to escape!  So is she!  This isn't obvious imagery at all!  I'm a character that doesn't understand human beings so we'll set the film somewhere in Europe.  How about some country where people have a really strong accent!  That will make it even more obvious how \"alien\" Scarlett Johansson's character feels!  Scotland?  Perfect!  Hey lets have a sequence where she completely disregards human life or their safety and totally mislead people in the audience to think, \"wow she is totally a psychopath!\"  This film has disturbing imagery, a nightmarish soundtrack, is immensely suspenseful and all this is immediately ruined by the films sudden desire to commit plot suicide in one of the most contrived, silly, dumb, and poorly written endings that will literally have you wondering why you just waited nearly two hours on a film that ruined its own \"twist\" only an hour in.  If it wasn't obvious from the beginning of the film its only more obvious as it goes on.  Which is just abominable and quite frankly could've been pulled off so much better.  I'm not accusing the film of being pretentious, but you can't combine a thriller with a Science-fiction twist with the kind of imagery and sequences in this film.  It paints the wrong picture for the audience and its very disappointing to both crowds of those particular genres.  You want to see Scarlett Johansson nude here and there?  Than definitely watch it, however, if you want an E.T. meets Species kind of film you're going to probably want to turn this off, and pick out one or the other- you can't have both anyway- that would just be filthy."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This unconventional sci-fi thriller set in Scotland is one of the best recent movies I've seen. S. Johannson stars as a taciturn femme fatale in the service of unspecified aliens who lures unsuspicious men into a lethal trap. The story doesn\u2019t get repetitive or boring, as after a couple of snatches, different encounters unfold.\rSome viewers may reject it as arty or pretentious, but it isn't either: the simple, short and original story coupled with the eerie Scottish landscape (urban and natural) and J.

The insensibility of Johansson's character by what is typically human is terrifying. Her wanderings stops in a slaughterhouse art-movie, over a syllogism of fragmented images where the black stuff and the annoying sound are the materialization of the Johansson's human emptiness. Maybe once banished, some experiments for feel like humans (eat, sex) come back to her with disgusting aversion and put she lost in the mist of peculiar human nature. Human cognitive world is as annoying to \"they\" as the plain life for/of some of us. She then tasted be preyed by weird human inhumanity of a sort of men (as the same of her own kind of fellows). Fixing of human skin by other kind of taxidermist, the visitors wrenching out the resemblance of humanity that is present in all men for disguise of some.

From the beginning images, reminiscient of the final hallucinations of \"2001: A Space Oddessy,\" to the beginning musical score that was taken from the same movie's choral ensemble\u2019s, this is an epic! The cinematography is spell binding, the Scottish landscape is mesmerizing, Scarlet is hypnotizing.  Do you stare at her nude body?  You, like the other characters, can't help yourself.

They beat you over the head with their ham-handed attempt to be artsy drawing out monotonous scenes way beyond the point where you \"get it\" to the point where you press the fast forward button... alot. That will be how you'll watch this, finger never leaving the fast-forward button. Unless you are stoned... then you might not notice you've been staring at a dot on the screen for 15 minutes, or looking at someone sitting in their vehicle doing NOTHING for 5- 10 minutes for the 5th time. Fast-forward is your friend.\r I'm giving it a 3 for these reasons, Scarlett Johansson takes her close off a lot (+2 initially then -1 for somehow making that monotonous), its science fiction (+2 but taking a point back after reading about the book it was based on and realizing they've ruined any chance of ever getting to see a decent movie based on that premise), and I'll give them another point for using actors that didn't initially know they were in a movie. Again, this is something I didn't know when I sat down to watch it but after reading up on the production, I thought that was worthy of a point for initiative and an uncommon approach to filming a sci fi movie.\r It might have made a really good short film of about 20 minutes or less, but utterly fails as a feature film. They just really obviously had to stretch out the monotony to drag things out to the number of minutes they felt they needed. Watch the first 5 minutes. Turn it off. If you still feel compelled to watch it, you'll probably be in that 5% that likes to be hypnotised or something.

The more I think about it, though, these details do not matter. The viewer is given room to think for themselves and I appreciated the opportunity to fill in the gaps myself. Most of the movie provides enough information to draw general conclusions and powerful emotions. Some people will hate it because this is a sensual rather than a narrative experience. People expect stories and this is more like an out of body experience. I found it fascinating. I learned things about people, about humanity. We are good. We are lustful. We are kind. We are ugly. We are stupid. We are beautiful. We are tragic.\r I will give a positive rating to any movie that is unforgettable. Or a movie that can change the way I see humanity. I think the scene where she leaves the baby on the beach will stay with me forever. And the conversation she has with the ugly man and her decision to run away after his escape. These scenes were powerful, logical, and downright fascinating. I can\u2019t stop thinking about this movie.\r It was disturbing to see humanity through the lens of this thing that walked among us in such a friendly city. That she was looking for lonely men made her less despicable. That she attempted to fit in for a while and try to live among us was both charming and pathetic. What happened at the end of the movie made sense, because she didn\u2019t fit in. She was objectified by men\u2026 brought out the worst in most (but the best in others).\r Art is left up for interpretation, and I think this qualifies. People will either hate or love this movie. It was too over-simplified to mask its deficits with confusing b.s. \u2026 it did not attempt to hide its flaws. It was deliberately made this way, whether you liked it or not. I liked it better than most movies i have ever seen. It gave me new insights. It got under my skin."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "My favourite film so far this year. The atmosphere is creepy, tense and disturbing. It says a huge amount with elegance and economy. It forces the viewer to think and evaluate, come to their own conclusions and (probably) fill in the gaps with their own fears and short-comings. I should also mention that the soundtrack is perfectly fitting.\rI would not recommend the film for people who enjoy the usual Hollywood fare of spectacle and explosion. If you enjoyed movies like those of Andrei Tarkovsky, you will love this. Scarlett Johansson is once again beguiling and stunning. An amazing movie!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Yes, that is a 10 rating.  Why?  Because it is refreshing to see a film that relies on the exercising of our cerebrums rather than satisfying the \"lizard\" parts of our brain with non-stop action, gratuitous sex, and over-the-top CGI animation.  Ironically, it is exactly that  older, basic part of our brain to which the hapless victims in this film succumb, lured by the de-glammed and striking natural beauty of Scarlett Johansson, an apparent alien known to the viewers and her prey as \"Laura.\" At times both mesmerizing and repulsive, Laura is both succubus and protagonist as we ride this existential roller-coaster to a surprising yet oddly appropriate conclusion.  I will admit that your average sci-fi addict may find this film a bit to \"artsy,\" but this movie is much more than a science fiction about aliens who have developed a fondness for human flesh tartare (a far too common theme).  This film is more of a mirror reflecting back a sobering view of the human condition, both at its worst and at its best.\r When the film starts as a small point of light in the distance surrounded by total darkness, growing ever larger until it is large enough to morph into what appears to be a surreal image of birth, then followed by a transformation into an eclipse and  then a human pupil and iris.  The accompanying musical score is both irritating and eerie, a combination that makes the viewer edgy and fixated on the imagery. I couldn't help but immediately think of certain scenes from Stanley Kurbrick's \"2001:  A Space Odyssey,\"  a stylistic homage not lost on many viewers and critics, it seems.  Next we see a fully safety-suited motorcyclist (the suit almost reminds one of a space garment) retrieve the body of a young woman (Scarlett Johansson) from what appears to be a ditch on the side of the road. The next scene is of this body placed on a lighted floor being stripped by a naked woman (also Ms. Johansson) who then puts on her clothes just as we see a single tear coming from the left eye and running down the cheek of the newly naked woman on the floor.  The alien woman (but is she really a woman?)  now has the appearance of the doomed female on the floor.  From this point forward, \"Laura\" drives about Glasgow in a white, windowless van selecting her prey (young men) like an urban-camouflaged jaguar.  She feigns being lost, a ploy that allows her to interview various men on the street, making sure they meet the right profile (young, strong, single, childless, live alone), then seductively offers them a ride that ends horribly for each victim who passes through the entry way to her home. Once inside, the seductive dance continues as Laura, well ahead of her duped would-be lover, continues to strip in an endless dark space covered by a jet-black, shining floor.  Her amorous suitors, following entranced, also de-cloth, and soon the floor turns into black liquid that engulfs each one, at which point Laura gathers up her discarded apparel on what to her is a still solid floor.  At one point the director allows us to see the fate that awaits those who become encased in this pool, and it is one of the most horrific scenes in cinematic history, and also where we learn one of the meanings of the film's title .\r Ultimately, the huntress Laura lures a facially disfigured man into her inescapable liquid web, but then allows him to leave even after he becomes submerged, the first evidence of compassion exhibited by the alien (As an illustration of just how devoid of compassion these visitors can be, in an earlier scene, Laura is chatting up a foreign surfer on the beach as a woman tries to save her drowning dog from the raging surf, her husband then tries to save her, then finally the surfer tries to save the husband, but fails, only to wash up on the beach to be clubbed over the head by Laura and dragged off to her van, as the family's infant is left crying, now alone on the beach.  The abandoned child is still there, hours later, when the motorcycle man shows up  to clean up the crime scene, completely ignoring the child.).  After letting the one man escape (her act of mercy later thwarted by the motorcycle driver), something changes, leaving Laura in a semi-catatonic state, abandoning her van and wandering aimlessly through Glasgow and into the country side where a well-meaning man takes here in and tries to nurse her back to health.  It is at this point she seems to awaken to the fact that humans are more than haute cuisine.  It is also following this epiphany  that she is exposed to both the best and worst aspects of human behavior, the final consequences of the latter that lead to her demise.\r I found this movie refreshing, chilling, artistically brilliant, and thought provoking.  Scarlett Johansson was the perfect combination of feline seductress and passionless, other-worldly entity that slowly transforms into confused catatonia as she begins to develop empathy for her former prey."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This will split the community into those expecting the Nude-Avengers and those seeking esoteric Arthouse. It belongs firmly in the latter and is top-line. Johansson shows again what she is capable of  when given the opportunity to develop a character (see Lost in Translation).\r With little dialogue, the interactions of the characters are intensified into a choreography and the story, itself almost banal, is just a space in which to dance. There will not be a sequel and both sides of the community will be grateful, but for very different reasons."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Visually stunning. Breath-taking.

Her naked body (displayed at length in the movie) is all that's necessary to get the average heterosexual male to follow her anywhere. : )\r Now on to the review.  For those who are fans of the Faber novel - on which this movie is based - don't expect to know what in the hell the book is all about.  I had to look up the Cliff notes.  The movie is a stylistic, art house, abstract adaptation of the book.  Sort of like a trip to the MoMA rather than the Met.  Is you're in the mindset...you'll enjoy it.  It's well acted, well written and generally well put together.  Thought provoking, powerful imagery are the strongest points of the movie.  Overall, a memorable piece of film worth watching."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The scene-to-scene change was almost TOO obtuse, so that it was close to confusing rather than cool and bizarro (suddenly the beach scene appeared and who was who and was that person drowning?) but the movie was still fascinating and the ending was great - once I saw the ending, I started making sense of the rest of it.\rIt is the kind of movie I think about long after I've watched it - a rarity these days!  The music really added too it...my non-sci fi pal announced that she was falling asleep but stuck it out."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "3 things I LOVE in a film: Stunning Visuals. Science Fiction. Scarlett Johansson. Given everything it had going for it I assumed an evocative story would be in store. I assumed wrong. So. So. So. Wrong. Next Stanley Kubrik? Please. This music video director needs to get over himself."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "A bonafide masterpiece, and I do not say such a thing lightly. The juxtaposition of Scarlett Johansson's  haunting beauty and masterful performance in the titular role, set against the bleak Scottish landscape and the intolerable ease unto which she coaxes her prey, culminate in a film that chills to the absolute core. It's pacing deliberately ramps up the tension and this coupled with an unbearably horrifying score left me on an absolute knife edge. As many have stated, it is indebted to Roeg, Kubrick e.t.c. but not in an obvious postmodern, heart-on-sleeve approach; as much as it borrows Glazer innovates. It is shot beautifully, it's pacing is sheer frustrating perfection and it has seriously gotten under my skin. It's a long time since a film has effected me in such a way, and it has left me thinking about it for days and even now weeks after viewing. I, for one, consider this to be one of the best \"science-fiction\" films to have ever been produced. An agonising, terrifying but unmistakably beautiful film. Let me make this clear, this is a paradigm-shift for \"science fiction\" cinema. Brilliant filmmaking."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "If I had to characterize this movie in two words, I would say, artsy and weird.\rIt's a science fiction movie that takes place in nowadays Scotland.\rThere is a small number of human-looking aliens that in some way consume humans but they try to be unnoticeable so they seek lonely people. The female (played by Scarlett Johansson) hunts for lonely but promiscuous  men. Being attractive and sexy, she lures them to a remote house and then to their death.  Those people are gone but nobody is looking for them. I assume that male aliens are similarly hunting for lonely human females. The movie makes you think what is it to be a human.\rJohansson is not only a very attractive woman but a very tented actress as well.\rBut I do not expect this movie to become a crowd-pleaser."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I did not get it. Reading up on the movie after having seen it, there was a plot there, a character progression that I honestly did not follow as it was happening. To me, anyway, the movie was a pure sensory experience.\r Of course, Scarlett Johansson nudity will do that do you. And there is a lot; we're not talking one or two fleeting shots. Nor is the nudity restricted to one character; it's quite egalitarian.\r However, the film works as something more than pure erotica. Scotland doesn't sound interesting, but they shot the hell out of it for this film. There's very little dialogue throughout and only bursts of sound; you're just watching one main character set against scenery. In the end, it's a film that asks questions, not just the obvious one, \"Would you follow a naked Scarlett Johansson to your death?\" (yes, answers half the world), but also \"What would an alien arriving on Earth make of us?\" and \"What's the difference between good and evil\". Even if you don't catch all of the plot that is being nonverbally conveyed to you, there's enough going on to make this an effective cerebral sci-fi film."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I don't remember the last time I walked out on a movie, even so this is not the case because I saw it all, however never did I have the before the urge of leaving the theater since 30 min in. This might be one of the worst movies I have even seen. If this were 70's sci-fi maybe I'd have given it a pass but now it just passed as pretentious BS. Don't lose your money or time in this."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "There is absolutely no shame in not understanding this movie completely. But giving a low review score simply because of that fact is really a shame. This movie is visually outstanding, and I had just so much fun being able to engage with the non-linear story that didn't spoonfeed itself to me. Whoever thinks that Scarlett Johansson is a lightweight simply needs to see this film. The scene on the beach? One of the most chilling sequences I've ever seen in a film."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "What a tease! The film presents an enigmatic premise and then drags its feet all the way to the conclusion, without ever letting us in on its secrets. I enjoy a quiet, contemplative movie, but there were so many long empty stretches and so few details that I found myself without much to contemplate.\r There's some great imagery and music, and a few fascinating glimpses of humanity through the eyes of an alien... But I found myself thinking more about the unusual production of the film than the vague narrative. In the end, it felt more like an over-extended short film than a fully-formed feature."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Wow. Even Scarlett Johansson's nudity couldn't save this 'artistic' piece from the monotone drone of alternating silence and annoying buzzing to the entirely uninteresting and utterly forgetful character development of the lead. The director's failure to get you the least bit interested in the character's development is a fatal flaw which leaves you mired in one boring shot after another. Symbolic? Sure. Do you care at all? No. There is nothing gripping and it ends as disappointingly as it plods along from the beginning. People walked out and for good reason. I stayed because I hoped for redemption at the end. FAIL."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "The film is not very interesting. It is boring to watch as things occur. When you wait until the end to think you have it figured out, you probably won't.

HORRIBLE HORRIBLE movie"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "I was really disappointed by this film. The trailer promised a lot more than it would eventually deliver. The comparisons with the works of Stanley Kubrick (whom I dislike) and Terrence Malick (whom I like) are ridiculous. I'd rather see this as more similar to David Lynch, though, again, comparison is ridiculous. The amateur look of the shots is not intentional, evidently: it's just this is an amateur film, only made with a lot of money and starring Scarlett Johansson; with all the flaws, the inexperience and the pretentiousness and none of the genuineness, the back-to-the-roots feel, or the love for film history an actual amateur film would feature.\r In conclusion, it's not worth it. The visuals are good, but they're used in all the wrong places for all the wrong reasons. In order to be symbolic, there would need to be symbols somewhere. There aren't. There are fetishes which appear to be symbols, but they are just put there to make you think they mean something. It's a trap. Don't fall for it. This gets a 3 because Scarlett Johansson is somewhat good, because at least they made the effort for an original score, and because I gave a 2 to \"Gravity\" which is still worse than this."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This film blows away the term \"Cliche\" and Glazers direction is top notch.

It comes off like an attempt to gain some kind of cult film following, but it was the most painful 2 hours i've ever spent in a movie theater.  Just not worth the watch, not even for Scarlet Johannson."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Scarlett Johansson drives around in a van trying to pick up men, as some sort of otherworldy creature (probably alien) who lures them into a seductive death. For long stretches the most exciting thing she does is put on and take off her seatbelt. When she veers from her routine, the mystery of her existence is slowly peeled away, but never fully explained. Haunting, repetitive music and some interesting special effects add to the creepy scenario. There is a certain uniqueness in the direction that is compelling, but overall, this is mysterious minimalism at it's most tedious."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Most of this film is Scarlett Johansson driving and walking (albeit often in underwear).

However, don't expect real dialogue, an interesting storyline or a point to this film.  Basically, a beautiful woman (alien in human form) drives around in a truck at night seducing dumb, horny men with superficial conversation. She takes them back to her house/cave and walks them into a black tar-like pit where they drown & are never heard from again. Repeat 10 times, the end.  The only way this movie could have been worse is if it were a double-feature with Jake Gyllenhall's film \"Enemy\".

It starts slow, and I would say it ends slow, but there really isn't much of an ending. But whatever it does in the final minutes of the movie, it does that slow as well.\r I understand that many people see much that is deep visually and metaphorically, but lets be real. This movie was not about entertainment. I don't know what anyone saw in any scene to be called \"beautiful\" or when exactly the plot was \"mindblowing\" because it simply never did anything for me.\r The plot was simple, unoriginal. The music was fitting (I guess) since it matched the movie's content (of which there was very little). Now while I do like many of the modern action films full of explosions, I also really love anything that makes me think. This one only made me think of why I bothered sitting through this entire movie. Again, nothing was visually all that appealing. Special effects at times reminded me either of a movie made in the 60s or 70s or perhaps just a super crappy 80s B movie.\r Bash modern films as you will, but they were certainly much more appealing visually than this one. Personally there was more depth to the script, the visuals, the effects, the story, the everything in a movie like Transformers (gasps all around), and I only watch those movies to watch explosions! I don't even expect good acting or good stories out of the Transformer movies, but wow they really beat up on Under the Skin in every conceivable way.\r I guess if you want an awkward movie that is predictable, that gives you nothing, that makes you consider sleeping or turning it off, look no further because it's here."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "See this movie, worth every penny !!
