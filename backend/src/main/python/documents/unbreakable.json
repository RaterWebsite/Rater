Davids transformation from lowly security guard to something much bigger (I wont spoil what) is both fascinating and yet still believable in part thanks to the understated performance of Bruce Willis in the lead role and Samuel L Jackson is as watchable as ever. This of course would not be an M.

In the end, this film is almost perfect and is very rewatchable."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I don\u2019t give out perfect 10\u2019s easily, but Unbreakable is, without a doubt, one of the most underrated movies of all time. It's unfairly compared to M. Night Shyamalan's previous film, The Sixth Sense, when the two films could hardly be more different. The only thing they have in common is their tone and comparing them is an unfair and unproductive thing to do. In my opinion, it's M. Night's best film and one that may not have met audiences's expectations but is far more intelligent and powerful than it gets credit for being.Shyamalan has a particular style to his direction that subtly adds certain aspects to the plot through visual cues. Everything has its purpose in the story. For example, the use of contrasting clothing colours adds to the nature of the characters. Scenes of dialogue are filmed in long, uninterrupted takes that make them so much more engaging because they flow so smoothly and are so well-acted. In every scene, the camera moves to follow its subject in a way that\u2019s seamless\u2014mesmerising, even. The score by James Newton Howard, once again, fits the film like a glove and sent chills down my spine during the climactic final scenes.This film is remarkably well-acted. Bruce Willis gives arguably the best performance of his career, as he and every other character evoke the fullness of possible emotion\u2014sadness, rage, hopelessness, and eventually happiness\u2014in even the most subtle of facial expressions. The actors are aided by a clever script that explores the complexities of power, good and evil, tragedy, love and loss, and what it means to be a hero. It\u2019s ambitious, and it balances its many themes with genius dexterity.I would describe Unbreakable as the smartest superhero movie ever made. It\u2019s twist ending\u2014contrary to popular opinion\u2014is not intended to be a \u201cWHAT?!\u201d moment, but instead it adds another thought-provoking layer to the beautiful character arcs. The film was well ahead of its time, written long before the superhero genre was thought to be full of potential, and it still holds up to this day as a masterfully-told story of ordinary-to-extraordinary.Story: 10Acting: 10Script: 10Visuals/Sound: 10Entertainment Value: 10OVERALL SCORE: 10/10"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "M.

The 1 hour and 47 minutes of boring, predictable and foolish sequences of silence in between unbelievably repetitive dialogue easily make this movie one of the most roll-your-eyes producing films I have ever gone threw. Bruce Willis plays the dull and slow-moving David Dunn, a lone and unharmed train wreak survivor who discovers that he is unable to sustain injury. Meanwhile, the emotionally unstable and easily injured Samuel L. Jackson plays the obviously brilliant yet deceiving psycho who thinks comic book heroes walk the earth. The movie unravels from somewhat interesting to boring.

This is of course, until towards the very end. One central problem with the movie is that it is highly unlikely that one man would go his entire life without tripping or falling and wondering why there was no pain or injury. His mother would not wonder why he never got Chicken Pox? His father would never wonder why his knee did not bleed when he fell on it extremely hard during some catch? His wife would not wonder why when he slipped in the shower and smashed his head on the floor that he did not feel any pain? It just seems so unbelievably silly and impossible for this to happen and for nothing to be realized until a frickin train accident at the age of 40.

Night Shyamalan) succeeds in drawing us in, and the subtle yet alluring acting (particularly Samuel L. Jackson) all adds up to be one of smartest of superhero movies."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "If ever a filmmaker vaulted from unknown to lionized status on the basis of one film, it was M. Night Shyamalan with \u201cThe Sixth Sense,\u201d a little-anticipated ghost story that became one of the 10 highest grossers of all time. The question of whether this singular writer-director can deliver again will, by itself, guarantee a large turnout for \u201cUnbreakable.\u201d The answer is that he delivers much of the same: Same star, same preoccupation with telepathic and quasi-supernatural/religious powers, same hushed tone and deliberate pace, same sense of absolute control. But there are also serious differences: A weaker story, increased pretentiousness, some ill-advised narrative zigzags and a \u201csurprise\u201d ending that can\u2019t begin to compare with the one in his previous picture. In addition to the draw repped by Shyamalan, Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson, yarn possesses sufficient intrigue to hook audiences and keep them on board much of the way, so despite the ultimate sense of letdown, B.O. prospects are very sturdy.\r Following a mysterious prologue revealing the birth in 1961 Philadelphia of a black boy who enters the world with broken arms and legs, second scene is so good that it raises what are gradually revealed to be unrealistic expectations. David Dun (Willis) is sitting by the window on a train shuttling to Philadelphia from New York, where he\u2019s had a presumably unsuccessful job interview.\r When an attractive young woman, Kelly (Leslie Stefanson), sits down next to him, he discreetly slips off his wedding ring and quietly chats her up, only to see her get up and move when he pushes too far. After putting his ring back on, he stares outside at the onrushing scenery until it becomes apparent that the train is moving too fast, at which point a cut to David\u2019s son (Spencer Treat Clark) flipping TV channels reveals the news of a terrible derailment.\r Brief scene obliquely provides all the exposition the viewer needs to know \u2014 the status of David\u2019s marriage, his job uncertainty, his willingness to move to New York \u2014 while superbly building a quiet sense of unease. Much of it is shot with an agile hand-held camera positioned behind the seats in front of David and Kelly, the cuts are all significantly timed, and the mix of sounds \u2014 the subdued vocal tones, the ambient noise of the train, the sudden whoosh of an oncoming diesel \u2014 is wonderfully subtle.\r Such a sequence establishes a sense of total confidence that one is in the hands of a master storyteller and creates an automatic viewer willingness to follow wherever he chooses to go.\r Some viewers will go along with all this, while others, like David himself, will resist. Because the mystery of where the story might be headed is sustained for so long, the film doesn\u2019t go off the tracks all at once. But the superhero angle, which seems a bit odd when introduced, eventually feels all wrong, especially when invested with supernatural and spiritual dimensions that seem like holdovers from \u201cThe Sixth Sense.\u201d\r And while the earlier picture cast the sort of spell that would have been disrupted by any comic relief, the presence of pop culture refs via comics makes quite notable the absence of any humor or sense of fun, just as it makes its pretentions to deep meaning and self-importance all the more specious.\r All the same, Shyamalan\u2019s handling of individual sequences is often extremely impressive; he clearly knows exactly what he wants and how to achieve it. This time out, he receives a great assist from lenser Eduardo Serra, whose widescreen work within a subdued color scheme is enormously textured and arrestingly composed.\r Also notable among the uniformly excellent craft contributions are Dylan Tichenor\u2019s precision editing and James Newton Howard\u2019s supple, supportive score.\r In subdued, subtle form, Willis gently conveys the essence of a working-class man seemingly beaten down by life but mostly victimized by his own refusal to realize his true potential. Jackson lends his commanding presence and persuasive dialogue delivery to the odd role of Elijah, which never becomes fully dimensional enough despite its backstory of tragic vulnerability.\r Wright Penn doesn\u2019t do much with the flatly written wife part, and it\u2019s during some of her domestic scenes with Willis a little more than an hour in that pic goes into lowest gear. As the couple\u2019s son, Clark bears more than a passing resemblance to Haley Joel Osment, but the kid plays a decidedly peripheral role in this one."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "M.
