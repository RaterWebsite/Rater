Seriously? This movie is absolutely brilliant. If you're someone who enjoys being fed meaning then it's simply not for you. Those prepared to feel their own way and drop the barriers between dream and \"reality\" will find an intangible joy in unusual and familiar dark places. When I first watched Mulholland Drive I felt cheated, disturbed and confused. I've since learned to give in to the confusion and explore all the gaps between my stupid expectations. I find it rather offensive that Mulholland Drive has such a high rating in comparison to Lost Highway and can only assume that it's due to the nudity and lesbian scenes. I really hope that isn't true. David Lynch uses sex as a vehicle for something far more erotic and devastatingly honest. His movies leave me twisting for truth and dreaming within dreams that turn on themselves and walk their way \"back\" into life. I will always have a sincere love and respect for the artist that showed me what I want by failing to deliver what I learned to need. Thank you for denying me this and granting me so much more."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I've been hankering to see this one again. I think it might be better even, overall, than Blue Velvet, though the latter is undeniably more straightforward. I guess I understand why the \"dream\" comparisons seem to be frequently invoked when talking about Lynch and \"Lost Highway,\" but if you know anything about Lynch's methods he doesn't particularly lean toward dreams or dream imagery. Rather, as I understand it, he just gets these ideas in his mind and he doesn't censor himself, so the starting material is different because he's never coming from the too typical place of just trying to come up with a movie premise that people might like. And then, when he starts putting his ideas together, he doesn't allow conventions and commercial concerns lead him astray, he stays true to his vision and he is one of the few who can get away with that.\r This film was the first to deal with the idea of a transmigration of identity, something Lynch may or may not have picked up from a 19th Century craze, I don't know. He continued working with this idea in Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire, though to me those two were less successful than Lost Highway, which is why I'm writing this. I hope more people can find out about Lost Highway and enjoy it as much as I have.\r So, to appreciate this film I recommend not getting too caught up in understanding it. It's a harsh critique of Hollywood, for one thing. The humor is about as deadpan as you can get. The violence is not pervasive but is at times strong. I don't find it gratuitous at all, though. Many people get their attentions taken with the sense of dread that is certainly there, but I now see more of the humor and style. Lynch is, above all, the most stylish of all contemporary American directors, I think without even a close rival. Also, he may be the sexiest. His sex scenes just sizzle and pop, think about the seduction scene in Blue Velvet or the lovemaking sessions between Cage and Dern in Wild at Heart. This film is no exception, Patricia Arquette smolders and her love connection with the young hero feels real and alive.\r The word \"pretentious\" some have used here puzzles me. Lynch may be Hollywood's least pretentious director! He's very true to his own vision and doesn't try to intellectualize. I don't get that criticism. Also, too much emphasis on \"understanding\" it. Look, it's kind of simple: there is a sort of identity migration. It's a mystical concept, no scientific basis for it, so you kind of have to go with it. It deals with evil in a way that may seem needlessly oblique to some but in return for a little patience and open-mindedness you get to see Robert Blake, in white pancake makeup, being Satan incarnate! I think that is worth the price of admission alone."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "One of the hallmarks of a David Lynch film is the element of surprise -- the sense of not knowing what will happen next and the queasy dread that what you're about to see could disturb and haunt you and linger in your head for a long time.\r Lynch established that agenda in \"Eraserhead,\" his first feature- length film, and he hasn't abandoned it to a futile quest for mainstream acceptance.\r It's impossible to imagine Lynch making a conventional film with \"normal\" people and \"normal\" entertainment values -- a fact that binds his fans to him but alienates many critics and moviegoers.\rIn \"Lost Highway,\" which opens today at Bay Area theaters, Lynch continues his exploration of the unknown and delivers a dreamlike meditation on reality, identity and paranoia. Set in a bland city that resembles Los Angeles, \"Lost Highway\" stars Bill Pullman, fresh from play ing the enthusiastic president in \"Independence Day,\" as Fred Madison, a spooked saxophonist who finds himself terrorized by a man who enters his house when he's asleep and videotapes him and his girlfriend Renee (Patricia Arquette) as they sleep.\r At a party, he meets a smirking trickster, played in ghostly white makeup by Robert Blake, who declares himself the culprit. Blake invites Pullman to dial his own phone number and to listen as Blake, who's standing before him, \"answers\" at the other end of the line.\r That's just a taste of what Lynch and co-writer Barry Gifford, whose novel \"Wild at Heart\" inspired Lynch's 1990 film of the same name, have to offer.\r There's also a murder; a fire; a personality transformation involving an auto mechanic (Balthazar Getty); a gangster's moll, also played by Arquette, who cons Getty into committing a crime; a memory lapse by Getty; a reappearance by Pullman; and a series of bizarre foreshadowings and precognitive images that may or may not pro vide clues to the mystery of \"Lost Highway.\"\r The result is a world, part film noir, part apocalyptic acid nightmare and pure Lynch, in which nothing can be trusted or relied upon -- least of all our psychic well-being.\r It's a weird movie, in that spooky/sicko, deadpan way that Lynch's movies always are, and it's guaranteed to repel anyone who likes entertainment wrapped in tidy resolutions and optimistic fade- outs.\r The visuals, Angelo Badalamenti's music and Lynch's sound design -- his perennial sound designer, Berkeley's Alan Splet, died in 1994 -- are all effective, and the comic bits, specifically Robert Loggia's scene as a mobster berating a tailgating motorist, are all effective.\r Filmmakers such as Lynch deserve our admiration for creating new cinematic idioms and exploring new ground. At the same time, \"Lost Highway\" often feels like a stunt -- like an arcane, deliberately perverse game that Lynch knew would never make sense. It's also feels, with its similarities to \"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me,\" \"Blue Velvet\" and \"Wild at Heart,\" like overly familiar territory. Lynch's great wish is to shock and arouse us, but in using the same kind of music, camera effects and offbeat editing rhythms over and over, his work is beginning to look like variations on a single theme.\r Arquette, whose low-in-affect style is perfectly matched to Lynch's, gives the strongest, most memorable performance -- and brings to mind Kim Novak's similar dual roles in \"Vertigo.\"\r There is also a cameo by Richard Pryor, along with appearances by Gary Busey, rock star Henry Rollins and Natasha Gregson Wagner, daughter of the late Natalie Wood."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "dont know how or why ive missed seeing this 1997 masterpiece of film making...its slow burn winds into an open mind and stays there, im sure it will, for the duration of my lifetime...Eraserhead, Wild at Heart, Blue Velvet, and now...Lost Highway...are such strange, memorable, phenomenally crafted works of apex art and now i savour this new find...and for another moment...i feel alive...feel...good...to be alive...it appears many of  \"critics\" do not seem to know what they are talking about...those who cannot act or direct, clearly make a profession out of criticism..i encourage those who make a parasitic living off films...to observe more intently...and speak with more reverence for that, which i observe, they often show such little respect...Lost Highway is masterful...watch it more than once...im sure it was meant to be watched more than once."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Thought this movie was garbage.

It neither sustains or builds up suspense like Mulholland Drive, but the critics have rated it very harshly.

A good movie that is as disturbing as it is interesting but if you need one to rent during a weekend get Mulholland Drive."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Lost Highway is as divisive as any other David Lynch film amongst critics and audience members alike. A confusing and convoluted film, Lost Highway's true interpretation is as hard to pin down as any other Lynch film, though it is perhaps a bit more accessible than, say, Mulholland Dr. In essence, Lost Highway is a film about the underbelly of society. Porn, sex, murder, and temptations abound in David Lynch's mesmerizing tale of a man who has opened his home to Satan and cannot get him out of his place. Told in the only way Lynch knows how - confusingly - Lost Highway can be off-putting, but for those willing to get swept up in its whirlwind, it is more than satisfying.Satan has entered the home of the Madisons. This much is clear. If the suggestions in the beginning of the film that Renee Madison (Patricia Arquette) was different and not like herself, the conversation between Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) and the mystery man (Robert Blake) cement it. Telling Fred that this mystery man is in his home and also showing that he is the source of the videotapes they have received hinting at Fred murdering Renee, it becomes clear that Satan has a hold on this family. How did he get into the home of Madisons? Via Renee. Just as Eve is the reason sin entered the world after she bit the apple from the tree of knowledge, Renee is a sex worker and porn star. By engaging in these sins and keeping the company of Mr. Eddy/Dick Laurent (Robert Loggia), who has clearly sold his soul for money and fame, Renee allowed Satan into the home of her and her husband. Once this happens, Satan lets himself into the home and toys with the Madison's and messes with the mind of Fred. Sending him to jail and then dumping him briefly into the body of Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty), Satan has his way with the Madison's, but ultimately gets his reward: their souls. Helping Fred kill Dick Laurent and welcoming Renee's nude body into his previously burning cabin, the Madison's souls are no longer their own. The transaction is, of course, orchestrated by Renee who says that the man who lives in the cabin will help her and her lover disappear.Sin engulfs the entirety of this film with the porn tape between Renee and various people playing throughout much of the final half hour of the film. People are murdered or driven off the road by men like Mr. Eddy or they engage in a variety of other sins throughout the film. This indulgence and embrace of the underbelly of society wreaks havoc on the family unit and destroys it thoroughly. In many ways, Lost Highway crafts an ode to films such as Rosemary's Baby or a companion piece to fellow 1997 release The Devil's Advocate. All show the temptation of sin and the potential rewards of selling your soul, but they always come in this world. Once it is over, the fire rages all around (as it does in the Madison's fireplace and in the cabin) and nothing but the gnashing of teeth remains. This film and the others show the aftermath of this and the pain, strife, and threat posed to our lives if we allow Satan in via our own sinful tendencies.A thoroughly hypnotic and freak experience, Lost Highway features a lot of similar traits to Lynch's works, namely wooden acting and weird people. Pullman and Arquette are terrific, however, and portray these sort of alien and confused people unaware of what hell their actions have awakened. The film is often stolen by Robert Blake, however, as the mystery man whose always looming presence is terrifying and thoroughly unsettling from beginning to end. Robert Loggia is also great in a truly intense and angry performance, instilling great fear and presence whenever he appears on the screen.Lost Highway is a divisive film, but is an equally horrifying one that really feels Lynchian from beginning to end. A parable on the dangers of giving into temptation and making deals with the devil for success on Earth, the film is hypnotic, mesmerizing, and perverse. Yet, it is also brilliant and a truly surreal experience as with all of his works. Nobody makes unique films like David Lynch and every single one of his films continues to defy expectations and pre-conceived notions about the film."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Of course the story is very interesting and you need to focus and think to understand it.

Pure creepy.David lynch is the type of director who explains nothing but shows us everything we need to know to gasp it's dark and yet deep meaning."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Lost Highway is not Lynch at his most accessible, that would be Blue Velvet followed by The Elephant Man and The Straight Story, and I would put those films as well as Mulholland Drive (one of his most polarising along with Eraserhead) as better films of his, but while it has divided and will divide viewers I did love the film. Lost Highway does occasionally get confusing (particularly from a psychological stand-point) as a result of trying to have too many ideas, which does seem to be what the main complaint is against it, but for me there was very little wrong (as a bit of advice it is a good idea to be acquainted with Lynch's style first with The Elephant Man or Blue Velvet being the best place to start). Lost Highway looks amazingly stylish, the cinematography some of the best of any film personally seen in a while, the colours are expressive and bursting with colour and hypnotism and the images are surreal but impeccably hypnotising. Lynch's directing is highly accomplished if not quite some of his best directing like Mulholland Drive or Blue Velvet. He also does a great job in not making Lost Highway too formulaic (there is a sense that formally and structurally that there was a fair bit of re-invention involved), in fact it was one of the freshest and most unique psychological mystery thrillers personally viewed. Like Eraserhead, Lost Highway is basically an atmosphere/mood piece and it works amazingly as one. It may be Lynch at his strangest but that made the film even more fascinating to watch, no matter what you think of some of the story the impact the atmosphere has in the film cannot be denied. The thriller elements are enough to set the pulse racing and the mystery elements while made obvious about half-way through have a lot of suspense. Bill Pullman's exemplary here, some of the best work he's ever done even, and standouts too are Patricia Arquette at her most sensual and Robert Blake at his creepiest. The music score is incredibly haunting with fitting use of pre-existing songs and while spare the dialogue doesn't stick out like a sore thumb too much. All in all, a bizarre film but with the mood it has and how well-made and directed it is it is a very compelling one too. Not Lynch at his best but around the top end of his filmography. 9/10 Bethany Cox"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Ironically, Lost Highway is not as good as I remember it.
