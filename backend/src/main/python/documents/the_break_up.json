Superficially reminiscent of 1989's War of the Roses, and to a lesser degree the 1967 Debbie Reynolds-Dick Van Dyke pic Divorce, American Style, but without either film's satiric precision, focus or gutsiness, The Break Up deals with a seriously mismatched yuppie couple playing psychological games with one another because one or both them have to vacate their Ponderosa-sized loft. Despite the time limit imposed on them by their Realtor, one of the film's failings is its absolute lack of ticking-clock suspense or comic tension, which is just as well because had these two stayed together much longer, it almost surely would've resulted in a job for the homicide division. The \"Telly Savalas\" bit and the a capella song sequence featured in the movie's trailers come off as less egregious than they otherwise would be because the whole movie is a haphazardly stacked series of rambling, pointless sequences arranged with a surprising lack of clarity by director Peyton Reed...and given how many nifty, original touches he brought to the cheerleader comedy Bring It On and the stylish, underrated Doris Day/ Rock Hudson parody Down With Love, the disappointment is truly painful. (His one good invention, if it was his idea, in The Break Up is the use of various splices of John Lennon's \"Jealous Guy\" as background musical stings.) And with the exceptions of Judy Davis and Jon Favreau, who at least has a pertinent third-act speech that cuts to the heart of Vaughn's character, I can't think of another recent movie that so thoroughly squanders such an interesting cast; I mean, how can the same movie come up with the brilliant notion of casting Ann-Margret as Aniston's mom and then give her virtually nothing to say or do? As far as the much-paparazzi'd leads are concerned, Vaughn's bloated, overgrown infant frat boy persona worked well for him in Wedding Crashers and Swingers but very little else, and it certainly doesn't here. (His best role and performance ever appeared in 1998's uncharacteristic, uncompromising and heartbreaking drug-smuggling drama Return to Paradise, but since that one didn't even crack the box-office Top 10, I doubt that we'll ever be seeing Vaughn challenge himself by doing the likes of it again.) And even though Aniston's character is right about 97% of the time (and yes, that includes the matter of the twelve lemons, too) she's so snooty and humorless that she all but negates the strength of her arguments. (She and that prig in the plaid shorts that she's seen with in the film's opening few minutes are true soulmates!) Aniston is a tremendously likable actress and most people's favorite Friend; I think just about all of America is rooting for her personal happiness and personal success, but this is by far her most mechanical and by-the-numbers performance yet...only in the lemon scene and her tear-stained moment of truth near the end does Aniston really catch fire. Perhaps instead of trying so hard to grasp the big brass ring with questionable projects like this and Rumor Has It, Aniston needs to keep doing more of the offbeat, independent material--like The Good Girl and the current Friends With Money--that really allows her to explore unusual avenues of her considerable talent and charm. THEN, after solidly establishing her indie cred, she can slowly build her commercial base. Hey, it worked for Reese Witherspoon, didn't it?"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "NOT romantic but a funny and realistic movie, highly entertaining and extremely believable story of a breakup.

Its a very funny and entertaining unromantic comedy."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Worst ending ever . . .like it was an afterthought, or a poor set up for a sequel....

Vaughn is aces as usual and the movie really rests on his shoulders as Aniston really is as vacant as usual. Vaughn fans won't be disappointed guaranteed. Also Judy Davis and Justin Long are great as Aniston's boss and coworker who help with her scenes when Vaughn is gone. Also a side note Favereau and Vaughn look HORRIBLE, wow. I couldn't decide who was harder on the eyes them or Anistons strange overly tanned skeleton look."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "A movie that just seemed to miss the boat every step of the way. It can be defined by everything that's not believeable. [***SPOILERS***] For most of movie it's not really believeable that these 2 people would ever have gotten together in the first place, then all of a sudden, late in movie, it becomes not really believeable (and contrived) that they wouldn't be able to work out their problems. Vaughn's such a self-asborbed jerk for most of movie, that when he shows up as someone more sympathetic late in the film, it's not really believeable he's the same character we saw up to then. And it's not like ealier in film he was a flawed but likable guy (as he was, for instance, in \"The wedding crashers\") Here, you just don't like him, or care about him. And it's not really believeable that Anniston would have the bizzare idea, that the way to improved her relationship with Vaughn, is to treat him like garbage. While this is something that might have worked in a more screwballish kind of comedy, here it just seems weird. In fact, movie did start off like it intended to be more screwballish, but somewhere along the line it changed its mind, and took itself more seriously. It seems alot of people here don't think much of Jennifer Anniston. I think she is a good actress, and has genuine screen charisma, but like quite a few actresses in Hollywood today, she has lousy judgement when it comes to picking her films."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "We saw this movie despite the critics' reviews (and because Poseidon Adventure would truly be an act of desperation) only to find the movie pretty entertaining.

(If you haven't seen these yet, check them out). They're makers prove a point, which is that movie footage can be manipulated to create trailers that seems to belong to completely different movies. I think The Break-Up suffered from a little bit of this. After viewing the trailer, most people who went to see it were likely expecting a light, breezy romantic comedy (ugh) and I'm sure were greatly disappointed. This movie is much more About Last Night (minus the almost pornographic elements) than it is How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days. As such, it is a wonderfully realistic portrayal of a relationship gone sour. If you like to see real life reflected on the big screen, go see this. If you're looking for escape, look elsewhere."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Sure, it's not going to win any Oscars, and it doesn't make you think \"wow, that's the funniest movie I've ever seen\". However, it's a fun movie. As with most actors and actresses, some views may like them while others do not. For me, I'm a fan of both Aniston and Vaugn, and I enjoyed them both in this movie. Admittently, some of the fight scenes go a little long (you can only sit still during a relationship fight scene for so long before getting uncomfortable), but there are enough funny bits to make it effective. As others have said, this movie is about a breakup, and the actors were convincing enough to make me believe their emotional investment and hardship. In the end, I left the movie threater feeling entertained. At least it's a break from the typical romantic comedy genre..."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "When Vince Vaughn is being his usual fast-talking sardonic self, The Break Up looks promising, unfortunately, that's only about the first 15 minutes and then it becomes a Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? spin-off except by this time we're already unsympathetic for both of them and just want it to end, it doesn't matter how, just end already. The supporting cast, especially Judy Davis and Vincent D'Onofrio, shine in their all to brief roles. Vince Vaughn's \"Idea\" for the story must have been a Great Indie script but the anti-romantic dramedy has been turned into a big Hollywood anti-entertaining film, and would somebody please tell Jennifer Anniston that there are roles out there that are not \"A cute Rachel type woman.\""}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Horrible... There was absolutely nothing funny about this movie...

Though Vaughn and Anniston seem like a mismatch before, during, and after (the ghost of Pitt maybe?), the humor works and you will definitely be entertained. It's a shame that they tacked on a ridiculously amateur and incredibly forced ending. I would suggest you leave when you think it is over, but then you'd miss the delightful Tone Rangers rendition of \"Rainbow Connection.\" Overall? Not overwhelmed, not underwhelmed, just whelmed."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Better than I had expected from the trailers. Some clever humor.

Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston deliver amazingingly well done acting that was so perfect...unfortunatley the directing does tend to drag out the wrong parts too long. If it had moved a little more seamlessly it would have been a great hit, but it's still really good and has it's value none-the-less. It's a little weird to see Vince Vaughn as the obvious antagonist, even though he's usually good at showing those moments we love to laugh at but don't want to be like in many movies. They really played on the strengths of the actors in that, and like I said, the timing is the only thing throwing it off. It would have come together more if they could have had just a slightly more satisfying ending too, as compared to the \"there's hope\" ending. I guess that once again comes up to timing on the director's part."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I thought this movie was actually really good. I'm not gonna lie before I actually sat down to watch it I thought maybe this movie wasn't going to be all that good, I thought it would only be funny for the first 20 minutes and then go downhill from there, but I was wrong. It was actually really really funny. Then again what movie isn't funny when Vince Vaughn is in it? I thought he did a really good job in this movie, especially with the serious parts, cause that's usually a side you don't see in him in movies. Jennifer Aniston was also good! I don't think she can ever do bad in a movie. She's defiantly one of my favorite actresses. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good romantic comedy that also has its serious parts that might be a tear jerker."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Definitely better than I expected.
