As Greg bends over backward to make a good impression, his visit to the Byrnes home turns into a hilarious series of disasters, and everything that can go wrong does, all under Jack's critical, hawklike gaze.",

The performances are really, really good, and the story and characters are so real and memorable. If you are looking for a good comedy, check this out!!!"

This movie will definitely make you want to watch the second movie and the acting is pretty great. Since this was the first movie in the series, this particular one is the best one. If you want a good laugh, this is the movie for you."

Anyone who thinks the definition of comedy is to have the one likeable and the only fleshed out character of the film to be bullied for two straight hours by one dimensional dickheads, should not have any creative control over a movie. It was a terrible watch. After seeing one character whom the movie depicts as totally normal and perfect for a girl get undeservedly trashed for a whole film, youd expect some kind of retribution which the film doesnt even attempt to offer. Oh yeah, and the girl for whom he suffers all this humiliation for is depicted as selfish, absent, cold, uncaring and vacuous. A movie which shouldnt have been made. With the cutting edge comedians now working TV, this kind of comedy was done to death 60 years ago. And much better ..."

In my opinion, not the best film in the entire world unlike T, and not as unique as other in-law films, but then again it's both an in-law film and it isn't, but in its own unique way it is, so a great film and the parents should watch this one before meeting your daughters 32 (give or take a few) year old boyfriend. You;ll find out ways to make sure he isn't interested in her breasts nothing more, making this a bit of a documentary."
