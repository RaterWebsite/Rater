The two worlds are strictly separated: the rich people live up while the poor people live down. The only connection between this two worlds is through the company Transworld. Adam(Jim Sturgess)is from down but he has the fortunate chance to meet Eden(Kirsten Dunst). They fell in love but are forced to give up their love by the police of the upper world. After ten years they'll have the opportunity to meet again and fight against the gravity that separate them. The concept of two rigid separated worlds is an original metaphor of many people who had lived in difficult political and economical situations in which they were brutally used and forced to live a humiliating life. For this people there was no love, no emotions. They were merely an object, easily expendable to build a prosperous and cohesive society. It is undoubtedly a very pressing matter even in our historical situation. So Adam becomes the focus of our sympathy. We deeply understand his desire of redemption and quest of a long lost love who could give him some relief from a grim reality, even though he doesn't know her exactly. For this performance, Jim Sturgess deserves all the accolades. He is very moving and convincing. On the contrary, Eden is a little distant, only object of veneration and love-seeking. As for Kirsten Dunst, it is a much brighter and easier role after her dark roles in \"All Good Things\" and \"Melancholia\". She has no showy scene (aside from when she tries to remember in spite of her amnesia) even though she plays well as always. Timothy Spall as Bob ,who assists Adam and finally helps Eden in her final decision, is very good. Juan Diego Solanas, for his brilliant idea, can be considered a really visionary director. He created a film which has some elements similar to \"Inception\", \"Gattaca\" and \"Stardust\" mixed together which are well corresponded. The script is simple but nevertheless it deals with the question of gravity which may be at times a little confusing. The special effects are really astonishing and the soundtrack really suggestive. My vote is 8/10."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "After reading the reviews, I had modest expectations going into this one.  I was so pleasantly surprised!

In short, it's a Romeo and Juliet story based on two tidally locked, geosynchronously orbiting binary planets, with one planet composed of matter and the other antimatter. There is no scientific consensus for how matter and antimatter interact via gravity, but one theory is that they repel, which is what the movie presumes. The orbital dynamics are sketchy (likely would require a binary star to push the planets together), but the \"three laws of inverse gravity\" succinctly summarize the net effects as perceived by our protagonists. A) The net force of gravity is in opposite directions for matter/antimatter, B) is a corollary of A, and C) matter/antimatter annihilate each other when they come into contact. C isn't explosive like how most action-oriented sci-fi portrays, and the gradual heating/burning process is actually somewhat realistic. Obviously the writers did their homework first, which is quite rare.The medical side of the movie that drove the plot isn't nearly as realistic, but used standard movie rules. Beyond that, I thought the plot was entertaining enough. There wasn't as much new ground with the human dynamics, but it's a sci fi/fantasy film with good special effects.

Travestita da film di fantascienza, ecco allora una fiaba che non  altro che l\u2019ennesima variazione della vicenda di Giulietta e Romeo: in un sistema binario, ci sono due pianeti gemelli ma dalla gravit\u00e0 inversa e gli abitanti del mondo di sopra sfruttano economicamente gli sfortunati che nascono di sotto. Gli unici contatti tra i due mondi sono il palazzo di un\u2019avida corporation guidata da uno squalo senza scrupoli che si chiama quasi come un whisky (Lagavullan  omaggio a Izzo?  impersonato da James Kidnie) e le cime di alcune montagne che si avvicinano tanto da consentire l\u2019amore impossibile tra gli adolescenti Eden e Adam (nomi fin troppo espliciti, si direbbe).

Dopo i bellissimi titoli di testa, realizzati dai francesi di Moustache Studio, e un affascinante prologo con i protagonisti ragazzi, il film resta sempre notevolissimo dal punto di vista visivo, ma perde la sua presa sullo spettatore perch\u00e9 incapace di coinvolgerlo dal punto di vista emotivo: le cause sono pi\u00f9 di una e si va dal ritmo non certo trascendentale a dialoghi mai davvero memorabili, dai salti e dalle svolte telefonate della sceneggiatura a un finale frettoloso. A farne le spese  la sospensione d\u2019incredulit\u00e0, che finisce per lasciare spazio alla voglia di fare le pulci da parte di chi guarda, con tanto di discussioni divertite sull\u2019amore che non fa sentire il freddo anche in cima ai picchi pi\u00f9 scoscesi o riguardo a come abbia fatto Eden a restare incinta.
