Daily soaps like Big Boss (In India) are derivatives of such ideas(they are pathetic in nature though,not even close to cube)..if you enjoyed this you might also enjoy the exam,house of 9 etc.."

      "text": "Cube: Cube is a story of six or so people who wake up in a... well... cube. On each side of the cube (including above and below), there are doors that lead to other cubes. Some of the cubes have deadly traps. There are three etched three-digit numbers on each cube that may provide a clue whether a particular cube is deadly and may also provide a clue on how to escape. Can the figure a way out without getting killed before they succumb to starvation or thirst or are simply driven mad?The Good: I have a lot of pet peeves in movies. One of the biggest is films that explain everything to the audience as if we were dimwitted fourth graders. The Cube explains nothing. I love this. We can decide which of the characters speculations are correct or even if any of them are. This creates a wonderfully engaging film.The film is well written with some excellent character arcs. Some of the characters are a little on the trope side of the equation (I am looking your way Rain Man) but overall it is an engaging group. There is a nice argument between just moving forward one cube at a time and the idea of trying to figure out what it all means. The movie really doesn\u2019t take sides once again allowing the viewer to decide which approach is best.The special effects are actually quite good when they make an appearance and the set keeps one's interest for the relatively brief running time.The Bad: The movie plays its room trap cards pretty early in a truly spectacular way. One wishes they had revisited that a bit more throughout the film. The film also suffers a little from the we ran out of cannon fodder too soon syndrome.It really isn\u2019t that hard to figure out is a three digit number is prime. If it is an even number or ends in a five it isn\u2019t prime as an example. Our so-called math expert in the group took way to long to figure some of these out.In Conclusion: This is a great example of how to make a low budget film with only seven actors, one set, and an engaging interesting script. The last part is a nut plenty of big-budget movies have yet to crack. Like the early Saw films, Cube is greater than the sum of its parts and a wonderful example of minimalism in a film."

It does seems confused about what kind of movie it wants to be, though. It begins promising a Resident Evil-like gorefest, but then morphs into a (albeit better) Twilight Zone-like thriller. For fans of Twilight Zone and 2001 and others that explore humanity and existentialism, this movie eventually gets it. For fans of people getting diced up, it doesn't last too long."

The most common reaction in the film was something like: 'Oh, let's do that door'. 'Yeah, let me check.' 2s later... 'Yes ok, let's do it'. - Someone dies - 'Aww, he's dead... tough luck'. - 'Let's try that door'. The actors are just to... boring. After all, I enjoyed watching this film. Actingjob: 6/20- As i said,i really didn't like the actors. Concept: 14/20- Good concept, really liked this. Although they could've done more with this. By that i mean with the actors, and the plot. Plot: 9/20- I'm not giving any spoilers but, i didn't like this AT ALL... I felt kinda empty after this. I was hoping for more till the last second. Then when the credits came up, i must say, i was kinda angry. 90 minutes... for this ?!Effects: 14/20- Pretty standard. Not so much that i can say about this. 4Character development: 8/20- You don't know anything about the character. You only know: the general idea. 43/100 --> 4/10 I expected more of this."

      "text": "Boring, but well done.I confess I expected more from this film. The script is very simple, typical in low-budget films: a group of people who do not know each other wake up, without noticing the reason, inside a windowless room in the shape of a cube. There are exit hatches in the center of each wall, as well as in the ceiling and floor. None of them know why they got there, where they are or what might happen ... but soon they realize that each room can hide deadly traps, and there is almost no way to find out which rooms are trapped, since they are virtually identical, although they are numbered.The movie is an attempt to make soft terror effective with few features and a minimal budget. To a large extent, the film does what it promises and gives the public a pleasant tension and a few moments of carnage. Here, however, the greatest danger comes from the tense relationship between characters, as the film plunges into a kind of \"cabin syndrome\" and relations between all are degrading. In this context, the good construction of all these characters (with a very rich and profound psychology, in a healthy coexistence since none of them is given prominence) is something to highlight and praise in this film. The cast is fairly decent, considering that I did not know anyone involved and everyone seemed to comply with the minimum that was asked of them and not make gross mistakes.The most unpleasant part of this film is precisely the fact that it is so simple: in fact, nothing happens here. Although the film flows reasonably, it is tasteless and has little to offer. There is no story, and that makes the movie boring."

Natali has tried too hard to make complex political and social statements, and continually piles on allegory as each character makes their beliefs known, and it becomes a meaningless and confusing mess.
