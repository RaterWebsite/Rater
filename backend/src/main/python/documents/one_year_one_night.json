They survive the attack, but when they leave the theatre, they are no longer the same. That night leaves a deep scar on both their lives and each tries to cope with the aftermath as best they can. C\u00e9line desperately tries to leave the events behind her, clinging to her previous life, while Ram\u00f3n repeatedly goes back to that night, trying to remember and understand what happened.

Sure there were holes in the plot, sure the writers took short cuts, sure the ending wasn't great. But for my money, it was just a simple mostly hilarious movie and my friends and I laughed our asses off to it. Michael Cera was hilarious as he usually is, and he basically stole the best lines from Jack Black David Cross was great too. Year One, don't entirely buy the critical dismissiveness on this one. If you want to laugh, consider seeing this."

The first time I saw it, I think there was just too much to take in. It's crammed with jokes and subtle body language. If you're stuck up or don't like outrageous humor like Dumb and Dumber, don't bother. I don't feel like reading another \"Woe is me,  this movie is so disgusting/offensive/gross\". Go back to your Downton Abbey.\r Best parts: Michael Cera dancing, \"You can stick your finger in it's hole\", \"Ribbit... Go Away Marlack\", Michael Cera Sleep Over with gassy kid, \"muscle tribe of danger and excellence\", \"What does this look like?\", \"I've seen what you do with your right hand, no thanks.\""

I'm all for them if there clever and funny (arrested development for example) but I almost hated sopmorical humor after watching this piece of s***. I am not even kidding one of my friends I was watching this with just walked out and I discussed with my other friend wether we should join him or not and now I wish I did. I am not even kidding when I say that I double dipped with my two friends to watch the new (now old) star trek and felt no shame as year one was worth getting paid to watch."

Michael Cera and Jack Black just flat out didn't work as a comedy team because they rely on completely different kinds of humor, Cera on being quietly awkward and Black on being over the top and dirty. But what made this movie unbearable was that it just wasn't funny. All of the above would've been tolerable if I had laughed a decent amount, but nothing in this movie evoked more than a chuckle. Don't waste your money on this movie. Heck, don't waste a Netflix rental on this movie. It's a waste of 1 hour 40 minutes of your life that you'll wish you had back."

      "text": "I had really high hopes when I heard the concept and saw that it starred Michael Cera and Jack Black. After seeing the trailers, I was really hoping that it would be better than what was shown. Unfortunately, this movie was a bummer. Not horrible- it was still light years better than Land of the Lost- but not great considering the talented roster of supporting actors. It was also a shame to see Jack Black recycling the character we've seen in nearly all of his prior movies. It was appropriate for this type of film, but it just seemed stale, like Will Ferell in LOTL. Michael Cera was great, doing his usual sad sack self deprecating schtick. Overall, this movie seemed like a half-ass Monty Python or Mel Brooks movie. It mostly reminded me how good Life of Brian was. In this case, I set my expectations too high. My benchmark this year for comedies is The Hangover, and this didn't even come close. Wait for the DVD or a matinee and you won't feel like you spent too much."

      "text": "\"Year One\" is no \"Life of Brian\", but any film, especially a mainstream one, that dares to satirize(and even question) organized religion, has balls. Whereas \"Monty Python's Life of Brian\" was ideologically similar to Depeche Mode's \"Blasphemous Rumors\"(both movie and song begrudgingly acknowledges the existence of God), \"Year One\" seems more in tune with XTC's \"Dear God\", in which Zed(Jack Black) no longer believes that the \"junk is true\"(paraphrased from the Andy Partridge lyric). The music video for \"Dear God\"(directed by Nick Brandt) shows a small child at the base of a barren tree, conspicuously apple-free. The heretical image challenges the concept of original sin as nothing more than a prefabrication. There's a tree in \"Year One\" too, akin to the Tree of Knowledge(from the Book of Genesis), where Zed takes a bite of the forbidden fruit with the expressed hope that its transgressive flesh will make him wiser. At one point, although the film won't come out and say it, Zed thinks he's Jesus Christ. But then the \"chosen one\" has an epiphany, similar to a hypothetical Jesus losing his faith at the crucifixtion. As the Sodom townsfolk gather rocks at his stoning(this is Zed's Passion), he realizes that nothing happened to him at the Holy of the Holies, so he loses faith and relinquishes his claim on being a savior. Late in the film, he tells the people to \"make your own destiny\"(implying that they forego idolatry and practice free will), because there's \"no pearly gates, no thorny crown\". In spite of its provocative subtext, \"Year One\" is sunk by its own puerility(the usual suspects: urine and poop make cameos). Too bad. Where Zed chooses the girl over being a religious icon, \"Year One\" plays like \"The Last Temptation of Zed\"(in which the Nikos Kazantzakis novel is rewritten when the Christ-like figure succumbs to earthly pleasures for good)."
