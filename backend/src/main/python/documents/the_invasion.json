And, hey, it also features Veronica Cartwright! Nicole Kidman is icily proficient as a shrink, and Daniel Craig adds sex appeal as her best friend/would-be boyfriend. The \"tips-of-the-hat\" to the 1978 feature are numerous and admirable...the spore zombies are frightening...the message will resonate with everyone except Republicans. Personally, I think it's one of the better horror films to hit the screen in quite a while. Far superior to the idiotic \"1408\", which the befuddled blowhard critics seemed to love. The family values are a bit heavy-handed, but what film post-1980 has been able to escape the obligatory mother-child bonding? And, yes, a few less car crashes and more moodiness would've been an appreciated... but, I still found it a suspenseful, well-acted, nicely filmed treat. Don't compare it to the Kevin McCarthy original. Don't expect the killer ending of the Sutherland version...just sit back and go for a creepy ride."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This movie was pretty good. I was surprised that it would be this good.

By the end of the movie I was pleasantly surprised. Kidman was great as Dr. Benell and her plight drew sympathy and had tension. Overall, this remake wasn't as good as the 1956 and 1978 versions, but wasn't as bad as some critics said. Give it a try."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Okay, just as a point of reference, the Metacritic score for \"The Host,\" the South Korean \"thriller\" released earlier this year, is 85, and the score for \"The Invasion\" is, as of 08/18/07 at 1:23 AM PST, 48. \"The Host\" was a poorly acted, agonizingly boring genre mish-mash that was appreciated in South Korea solely for the fact that it bashed the U.S; pretentious, gullible critics here salivated over it just because it was foreign. If \"The Invasion\" had been Czechoslovakian, it would have received a Metacritic score of 95. But because it's American, and because everyone's decided to start hating on Nicole Kidman, it gets snarky reviews from self-important windbags who wouldn't know a good thriller if it sat on their heads. This latest version of \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" lost me slightly only in the car chase near the end, which seemed designed to appease the adolescent male demographic; up to that point, the film was breathtakingly suspenseful, well-paced, brimming with dread, cleverly updated to make it resonate with current political events and sociological trends, and even, at times, poignant. It was also terrifying. Great acting from Veronica Cartwright, Nicole Kidman, Celia Weston, Daniel Craig, Jackson Bond, and others made the terror painfully human."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I loved this movie, but I'm pre-disposed to enjoying apocalypse-type films.

Well, the all-star cast didn't do it. So, yeah. It sucked. The structure was terrible. All sorts of build up, then a climax and falling action so short and unsatisfying it leaves you blinking stupidly. It ends on the APPARENT note that the humans are innately flawed and they are doomed as a species. So what, Mr. Director? Do you want us to become infected by an alien virus with vague intentions? Or do you want us to become absolute socialists and shed all human qualities? What saves this movie from a one is a few thrilling scenes, and their ATTEMPT at a philosophical message. I'm glad I didn't pay for this thing."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Very good movie, kept you on your seat, but nothing scary scary"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Loved it, but somethings could have played out differently."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "not as bad as everyone says, very good acting from Kidman and Craig, good chemistry. enjoyed the creepy modern touch and comments on society today. Kidman was superb and believable as a doctor and mother who was trying to protect her child. enjoyed seeing veronica cartwright in this remake as she was in 1978 version."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Reading these \"0\" and \"1\" reviews, I can't help wondering how many were written by disgruntled Scientologists out to smash the former Mrs. Cruise's career... Why else so much Kidman-bashing? It's a great bit of entertainment, this film, with a resonant message. Especially, I'm sure, for Ms. Kidman, who must've felt a little like Dr. Bennell, whom she portrays, during her marriage to Cruise. Pods = Scientologists, perhaps? Trying to save her child from the \"cult\"? Interesting that so many Users call Travolta's mediocre performance in \"Hairspray\" a revelation, but Kidman's is reviled. Conspiracy theory? Or maybe a bit of art immitating life? Anyway, go see this film. It's not as perfect at the 1958 or 1978 versions, but it's a creepy, atmospheric nail-biter that is far superior to the dreck studios have been releasing lately and calling \"horror\". Kidman is excellent and convincing as a psychologist, Craig is a dashing hero, Veronica Cartwright is, as always, jittery-perfect. The nuancd background activities are perhaps the eeriest part of the film, and make the car smash finale forgivable. See it!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This film is the latest in the remake series of Jack Finney's The Invasion of the body snatcher's, in my opinion this one is the bests out of all of them, when Invasion of the Body Snatchers came out in 1956 it instantly became a sci-fi horror cult classic marking it's place as one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time. The Invasion does not fall short of brilliance, albeit they change the story around a bit to suit 20st century audiences, they changed how the virus came to earth, in the 1956 version it was pods, in this one it was a space shuttle that was carrying spores that pass form human to human. But the Invasion is not a terrible sci-fi horror film, it amazingly quite well done, considering the talent this film drew( Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, Jeffery Wright & Jeremy Northam.) it's a stellar cast for a stellar movie. The Invasion doesn't hurtle trough it's story, it takes it time to explain and tell it trough a mild pace that quickly speeds up as the story progress, this film explores another aspect of an attempt to take over the world, where as most films that takes the same approach begin it with a mass alien invasion of our planet, this film strives from that and approaches a more quieter and less destructive approach to taking over our world it follows a virus that while you sleep takes over your body and controls you, with that said The Invasion is a run for your life, cover your eyes Sci-fi horror film that you can not afford to miss."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "A very poorly done adaptation of the story. The actors are fine, but they can not really do much with this poor script. The movie totally lacking of suspense. There is no paranoia at all. The whole thing has a TV quality to it.

It pretty much turned into a ridiculous zombie movie which ruined and chance for a different or unusual spin on the end."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "The original Body Snatchers scared the bejeebers out of me and to this day, I can't watch it.

Build-up. \"The Invasion\" cuts to the chase in the first scene(Nicole Kidman needs drugs to stay awake). The latest remake of the fifties sci-fi classic(this is not an improvement on Abel Ferrera's \"Body Snatchers\") moves too quickly, and in doing so, denying newbies the building of tension that was tantamount to making the original 1956(and 1978) versions successful. Directed by Phillip Kaufman, the latter placed Donald Sutherland on his feet when he was pursued by the human replacements. In this version, Nicole Kidman makes her getaway by car. That's not scary. That's an action film.

The film makers main gimmick seems to be the \"spread by vomiting\" scenes. This proves to be tired, lame, and, frankly, lazy on the writer's part. The characters are not sympathetic.

It falls short of its goals mainly because of the contrast between the two genres the film aims at: An A-grade B-movie. The scary parts aren't scary, and the boring Flaming Car scene could be a classic in the hands of a more imaginative director. The smart parts raise some interesting questions, and the Dinner Party scene is obviously the intellectual highlight of the writers, but these questions get lost in order of giving us a great happy ending we don't get enough from Hollywood nowadays. Nicole Kidman is an intelligent actress with a taste for disappointments. Daniel Craig is wasted as Ben. Everyone else could be anyone else, and we wouldn't the difference. A So-So Movie: So much Potential, So much disappointment."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "While not a truly horrific film, Warner Bros.' remake of the 1956 classic is simply bereft of anything that made the original so good while offering a truly fractured and tonally awkward film in its place. Originally directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel and written by Dave Kajganich, this troubled film was sent back for action movie and twist ending reshoots with director James McTeigue and The Wachowskis writing. This disjointed nature is truly evident as this film offers the occasional look at the paranoia and terror only to then abandon everything over-and-over again in favor of long action sequences.\r The original was great because of the paranoia, the hopelessness, and the isolation inherent in its storyline. Taking place in a small out-of-the-way town, you knew there was no way help would ever arrive. The characters had to piece things together on their own and fight back. The Invasion takes this isolated premise, puts it in Washington DC and in the modern world where we are always connected. Interesting idea to update everything in this regard, but it ruins the aforementioned areas in which the original excelled. This could be okay if there was something offered up to help bolster the film up. Some true horror.\r Luckily, there are a few scenes of panic. The film has interesting action set pieces with a few moments that really get your heart pumping along the way. These may be few and far between while entirely tacked on, but hey, they are there all the same. However, the problem is that these feel weightless. The entire time this one feel incredibly rehashed and \"been there done that\" to the point that nothing feels unique. I get the plot is not original, but it could have brought the original story to the modern day with some new elements while still bringing forth the horror of the original. Yet, this one is like every other political science fiction thriller on the market nowadays.\r The worst way in which it updates it is with immunity and Dr. Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) guessing within 30 seconds what illness would have made somebody immune to the invasion. To state it again, the original had this hopelessness and this endless feeling to it, bolstered by the fact that we never see the invasion take any losses. It is undefeated in the original. For The Invasion, however, it is clear the studio determined that modern audiences could not handle such dread or anything nearly as bleak as the original. Rather, we must fight back because \"for better or worse\" we are human. Classic Hollywood. Nothing too dark, only the lightest possible conclusions are acceptable. While the opening is incredibly tense and well handled, the second the immunity is revealed, the film nosedives hard and not just turns into an action movie, but turns into a film unwilling to take chances, which is a terrible thing to be.\r That said, on the positive end, the acting is good. I love Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, and Jeffrey Wright. As is expected, the trio do the movie more justice than it truly deserves. The first half is also very well done and shows considerable promise, in regards to delivering on this sense of mystery, dread, and horror, while also not just treading on the same plotline as the original. Though some of the same characters exist, the updates and changed roles are a welcome addition to make this one feel even fresher than just its setting.\r The Invasion is a largely misguided remake that simply misses the essence of the original. It was not action movie. Rather, it was a terrifically executed political film that executed the science fiction part even better. Filled with dread, bleakness, and hopelessness, it underscored this in the way in which the film ended. Though humans were just figuring out what was happening, there was no way to know how to fight back. Here, Nicole Kidman makes breakfast for Daniel Craig and her, now, two sons while they play happy family.\r Also, did anyone get 1984 vibes from this one? Essentially, this one argues that to be human, there must be war, anger, and hatred. Sounds a lot like \"War is peace\" to me, just saying..."}], "recommendations": ["the_conjuring_the_devil_made_me_do_it", "i_am_legend", "insidious_the_last_key", "signs", "what_happened_to_monday", "the_last_witch_hunter", "reminiscence", "the_mist", "ouija_origin_of_evil", "insidious_chapter_3", "repo_men", "the_purge_election_year", "poseidon", "color_out_of_space", "happy_death_day_2u", "riddick", "annabelle_comes_home", "final_destination", "dark_skies", "sinister_2", "insidious_chapter_2", "terminator_genisys", "independence_day_resurgence", "edge_of_tomorrow", "world_war_z"]}
