The script was derivative but this could perhaps have been made to work if there was some intelligence and imagination put into the action scenes. Unfortunately, the opposite occurs, with the worst flaw of the movie being the atrocious direction. The pacing was terrible, camera work unfocused and poorly framed, and the entire thing felt slapdash.

The audio and visual aspects of the film feel fresh, clean and are highly entertaining. The acting and casting make a solid backbone, you get the feeling that these people enjoyed working with each other and it shows in their chemistry. Essentially, everything that came after the pen and paper aspects of this film is well done.BAD: Sadly, the paper that this film is based upon, the most important stuff like script and story are uninspired at best. The story is derivative and lacks scope and imagination. There isn't much story once the premise is setup. They invoke deus ex machina to create their happy ending. Some of the most important human connections in the film are paper thin, causing it to feel emotionally emaciated. Without hyperbole I can say that the vast majority of people watching this film could have come up with a more imaginative story. They would have been better off going with some epub fan fiction. I can go on and on, but it comes down to a severe deprivation of imagination, and going into a highly saturated genre, without imagination, new ideas, or story depth, well, that's just stupid."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Movie was pretty boring.

Remarkable for how it improves on the Marvel superhero formula with a fraction of the budget.

However there is some blurry things about the involvement of the army or the government. It's not very well explained. The FX are really good especially with displaying the powers.

The first thing I noticed when I started watching this movie was the cool camera angles/shots. The way they specifically decided to shot and zoom in at different points of the film added to the overall vibe.  Additionally, the overall aesthetic built off of this. The bright background and interesting filming choices were the 1st things that made me want to be in this world. The fact that this movie gives a new twist of the storyline of mutant type people who have cracked the secrets of evolution, ......you would expect them to show us powers. Well, they delivered. For a Netflix original, this had GREAT CGI. I really enjoyed the way they showed how the \"Power\" (pill) affected its users on a molecular level. Alongside that, the sequences of people using their powers and fighting were full of action. Now, I also enjoyed the main cast. Both Art (Jamie Foxx) and Frank (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) had a great dynamic with Robin( Dominique Fishback). They both seemed to be very protective over her even though they've both only known her for a little bit. And, each character had a good background story especially Art. Overall, this movie for me is 9.5/10. I want more of this movie.....of this concept. P.S.

Great job :)"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Roller coaster of a ride with incredible performances from all the main and supporting cast. Tasteful and brief, as they should be, a few honorable cameos can be spotted throughout the film with lots of room to extend the universe with some reappearances and world building in a sequel. Taking a step away from the borderline campy vibes from your average superhero movie, Project Power deliveries on action packed variety of powers and sets a realistic take on how the world around them might react. Clever storytelling gives a believable reasoning to the origin of the plot alongside real world issues such as political corruption and societal influences of a broken system bearing down on your average citizen, giving well rounded character development and fluid relationship building between the characters. Every bit of dialogue builds to the next scene without cliche expectations of the characters winking into the camera as so many movies do and keep the audience compelled throughout its entirety - as a smoker, it shocked me to realize two hours had come and gone by the finale. Hands down, a 10 out of 10, and I can\u2019t wait for more. Netflix, please pick up Project Power 2!"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The movie was great.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the cop trying to stop its spread, when Jamie Foxx shows up with his own motives. They team up with a teenage dealer (Dominique Fishback) to rout out the culprits. While the plot and script is essentially trite, the most compelling element is seeing what powers will emerge. They're OK, but never especially cool and more often they serve to muddle up matters. Meanwhile, the fight scenes are confusingly staged, which sometimes makes the action hard to follow. While it's moderately entertaining, this film lacks enough originality or filmmaking skill to make this project powerful. On a side note, even though the location is regularly announced as New Orleans, there's little flavor of the city and nobody sports an accent."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Good idea, terrible execution. You can tell in the first 20 mins this never goes anywhere interesting. There is no introduction to the characters or world, it just starts in the middle.

Overall I came away from this movie wanting something more grounded... more condensed. The watered down tv quality direction and editing rush along at such a pace, it feels like we cant stay in one shot for too long lest we see through the cracks.... (sadly I think seeing through the cracks would be a more interesting journey!)The over saturated visual effects scenes just go to show that sometimes too much cheddar really is too much with a lack of subtlety and nuance to the powers and character pieces that could have made for far more interesting visual storytelling.

And Jamie Foxx's expression hardly changed the entire movie. The plot was thin and elements were ripped off from other movies.  The cinematics were so dark that you wanted to pick up the phone and hire them a lighting crew.  It made me want to turn on another light in my living room.  Why did they have to shoot 90% of this movie at night?  The movie is predictable but many will lose track of what is going on because the scene progression is so bad.  Indicating bad direction.  People will wonder \"how did we get to this scene?  How is it relevant?\" Those that are still awake, that is.

If you want an interesting narrative with fleshed out characters who elicit emotional responses, look elsewhere.With Foxx (Art) and Levitt (Frank) involved, this film had me expecting much more -- can't help but think they signed up strictly for the money because the script is banal. I was hopeful at the start because it seemed as if Foxx really might play \"the bad guy\", but you quickly learn that's not the case. That said, Foxx does what he can with the hackneyed script. Levitt seems miscast -- felt like he phoned it in. The actress who plays Robin (Dominique Fishback) was just painfully amateurish.The biggest problem was that we were supposed to feel something for Robin and her ill mother, and we *should* have felt something for Art and his daughter, but the film fails miserably at getting the viewer invested in their lives and emotions.This felt like a B(minus)-movie with a couple of A-list leads. It gets an extra point or two for (self-conscious) style -- the scene with the frozen woman was fun -- but serves as little more than distraction."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Besides one cool scene halfway through, this movie is just dumb and mediocre. 51/100"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "I would bet a big pile of cash money on a scenario where this was a script sitting in a drawer.  The plot revolved around a new designer drug upsetting the seamy underworld of New Orleans, but it was so cliche and overdone that it was left in that drawer.  AND THEN, one day, someone saw \"Limitless\".  Then they looked at the money the big superhero movies are making.  They sent forth the command \"Make that designer drug into a superpower pill\".And that's why \"Project Power\" is a lone wolf cop and a distraught father taking on drug cartel movie you've seen a hundred times before.  The filmmakers had a mediocre budget and, worse, a low watt imagination in offering the superpowers.  The superpower angle is nothing but, to use the old saying, putting \"lipstick on a pig\".  I won't say it is a bad movie.  It's just a dull movie that is only recommended because of the pandemic and pickings are getting slim."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I think this is the first big Netflix film that doesn't feel like an attempt to satisfy the most ''serious'' viewers but it also doesn't feel like a film discarded by a large studio that Netflix knows will satisfy its less capricious viewers.Project Power is entertaining, yes, even though its non-innovative plot felt muddled, but manages to do enough to function with what it has.I say this because it works on a level that doesn't seek to try something more interesting.This could've been more ambitious in terms of scale but the obvious lack of imagination entombed it on a very basic level.I mean the final battle occurs on a freighter. People with superpowers and that final act felt like Die Hard 6.It certainly relies on having Jamie Foxx and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as protagonists to attract more attention but Project Power stays halfway through.It's not a failure, I don't see it that way, but it's a common film.

Instead, the plot asks an important question - what would happen if we all got our hands on a chemical that can transform our capabilities beyond recognition? Does it mean we doom ourselves to extinction? Does it mean chaos will multiply to an unimaginable degree or we could evolve towards a united, caring and contributing whole - as humanity.This got me thinking and I was hoping very much that the movie would address it in a fine blend between dynamic sci-fi action spiced with philosophical attributes, however I came to realize that beyond the fine visual effects and actors' play, the movie felt more than half empty. I found that the character development is flawed. Throughout the entire movie I never really grew to caring for any of the characters.

The three main actors give solid performances and are fun to watch (I particularly enjoyed Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a towel as an angry husband. Jamie Foxx kinda phones it in). The villains suck though.I thought Machine Gun Kelly was going to be the most distracting thing about this movie, but then Casey Neistat showed up.
