But the original source material is so strong that to anyone who has read the books this movie is a travesty. The casting is dubious, but it would have been ok if the script and direction were even halfway decent. As it is, the characters are severely one-dimensional, and the script reads like \u201cmy first dialogue\u201d. In short, a long-awaited movie franchise disappoints."

So lifeless in fact, even Michael Keaton knows there's better roles out there and saves his talents for something better.However, it dose have some interesting action sequences and decent looking shots. So the technical side of things stops this from being flat out bad.Dylan O'Brien, on the other side, is at least trying his best from what he's given. Slowly building himself to be a action star or a strong leading man, if he continues this path."

      "text": "The actor playing Rapp isn't physically imposing enough to be credible in the role.  Seems like a kid, no threat, doesn't seem appropriate at all.  No voltage.  The idea that he somehow works out for 6 months and then starts infiltrating terrorist cells in Libya, knows the Koran and speaks Arabic, etc. -- just doesn't fly at all, right off the bat.  It's the kind of thing an inexperienced screenwriter writes, and it seems OK to read it in the script, but it doesn't actually play well to the audience.  The intuition to detect this kind of problem and avoid it is a prime distinguishing characteristic of better screenwriters and directors.  The whole movie somehow fails to create the suspense and credibility that Bond, Bourne, etc. do so well. It's like an imitation spy movie.  I actually fast-forwarded through several parts of the DVD, just couldn't sustain interest -- and many scenes are hard to figure, stuff happens but it's not very clear exactly what.  Lots of foreign dialogue with tiny subtitles hard to see on the TV also detract from the storytelling.  Weird fail, doesn't make the grade despite a lot of effort that obviously went into it. The lousy special effects at the end - blue-tone CGI stuff - puts the nail in it. It's that blue-tone 1997-style video-game CGI that more than anything, brands a bad movie these days.\ufeff"

The last quarter of the film simply threats the audience as if we still believe in Santa. It begins with the main character using a car that was far from the tunnel entrance to invade the place his boss was being captive, then the villan sets the bomb to 20 minutes although the real target was at least one hour away and last but not least it seems that the explosion of a nuclear device wouldn't destroy miles and miles of italian coast with a tsunami. Twelve year old kids will like it.  Don't you dare compare it with Jason Bourne and James Bond films!"

      "text": "Hollywood never tires of these impossible odds tales of international \"intrigue\", with spying, ultra violence, poetic justice, yadda yadda yadda.    And because this genre is so gentrified and cliched, it takes special writing and casting, not to mention direction to rise above the rest.    \"American Assassin\" does not.    Vince Flynn is the author of the mass market paperback series that features Mitch Rapp, a seemingly indestructable intelligent agent in the vein of other fictional tough guys like Brad Thor's Scot Harvath, or Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan.    Had I recognized this as a Flynn book I probably would have chosen not to see this movie because unlike at least Brad Thor, who writes more interesting stories, I thought the one Flynn book I read was as cliched and hackneyed as James Patterson or a dozen other authors who churn out the same formulaic tripe book after book after book.    So we have Dylan O'Brien acting the Rapp character, and right away the movie starts to fail under its own premise.    For my money, O'Brien is, for all intent and purposes, another Keanu Reeves style actor, all muscle, violence and the personality of a bar of soap.    Mitch Rapp is supposed to be the ultimate charismatic badass, striking fear into the foe and in theory at least somewhat emotional.    Sorry.    He just plain does not convey the personality his character is supposed to be.    The only saving grace is Michael Keaton, but he can't save this clunker, either.    Even the premise of an inevitable nuclear explosion failed to pique my interest.    It's political thriller done by a paint-by-numbers kit, and for all its supposed gun violence and the usual stereotypical terrorist behavior, one of the year's yawners."

Mindless, but entertaining."

Yes, there were a few \"oh please\" moments but the plausibility in general was satisfying. And any action movie that features a nuclear explosion has got to have something going for it.

Try as Michael Keaton and Dylan O'Brien might, there's no glory to be had in trying to sell some of these dopey character moves and hackneyed plot points. Seriously - the \"unhinged/loose cannon C.I.A. operative rallying against his superiors orders so he can stop the rogue operative from detonating a nuclear device\" narrative has been so done to death that it's a miracle this movie was even remotely watchable. But, indeed, \"American Assassin\" does remain at least that; watchable. If the overused plot threads provide anything, it's a sense of familiarity that the audience can at least navigate through. And the occasionally decent fight scene or set piece doesn't hurt either. Needless to say, I was never bored. But, alas, I was also never really that impressed either."

Foreign terrorists are portrayed as religious nutcases rather than the intelligent and connected extremists that they are. It's easy to call someone your enemy if you only demonize them for the reasons that you find disturbing.So, overly emotional and needy boyfriend asks hot girlfriend with nice boobs to marry him. Seconds later half the beach, including the girlfriend, gets shot to pieces by some dudes who apparently were \"Terrorists\". They looked more like layed-off tattoo artists to me but fine.Boyfriend gets angry and trains himself to be a douchebag to kill terrorists. Douchebag gets added to a special unit. Douchebag is arrogant and oblivious to the teachings of his surroundings. US government still thinks they can go abroad, cause death and not expect there to be repercussions from their actions. In this case the bad guy is actually an American defector. And thus the vicious cycle continues.Lets talk about the movie as an entertainment property though. The movie does keep you interested, but the story is rather unrealistic and too unbelievable to be taken seriously. The main character is unlikable, and is a walking contradiction in regards to what he considers \"The Enemy\". Had the story been believable, that wouldn't have mattered. But that's not the case here unfortunately. The Americans in this movie get a lot of innocent civilians killed, all because the Irakians want to make a nuclear bomb to blow up Israel... Yeah that will totally not have disastrous consequences for Irak... So dumb, only an American could have written this and not realize the hypocrisy of it all. It is a bad movie. I give it a 4/10."

It is far from a cinematic masterpiece but it is a pretty solid action/revenge movie. Dylan O\u2019Brien is, unfortunately, pretty meh as the main character. Michael Keaton on the other hand is quite good in his character.It is a reasonably action filled movie and I really like that they didn\u2019t try to turn it into some PG-13 crap. It is sometimes fairly brutal. The story is okay. It works. It is not overly complex and some people are probably moaning about it not being original enough. Well, I say, so what? It is a good concept so why screw with it? I do like revenge movies and although this one is far from the best, it is not at all shabby.I wonder why some people seems to be claiming that this movie is just crap, one star out of ten and so on and so forth? Is it maybe because it dares bring up the subject of Islamist fanatics killing innocents? Or maybe because it doesn\u2019t try to sugarcoat things and explain these \u201cpoor misunderstood\u201d psychopaths but lays the blame straight on said lowlife as well as on Iran? Or maybe because it doesn\u2019t try to blame certain of today\u2019s political retards\u2019 preferred boogieman Russia?I have not read the book so I guess, if it doesn\u2019t do the book justice, I can somewhat understand not liking it. However, to me, this was a decent, not spectacular but decent, two hours of entertainment. Decent action, decent speed and (with the exception of O\u2019Brien) decent acting."
