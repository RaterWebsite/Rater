John Travolta, don't get me wrong, does look a little messed- up when he's bald, but damn can he play a pretty kick- ass actor! There are relations to Pulp Fiction in this that made me laugh, and if you don't know what I'm talking about, uh, maybe you should've seen that before you saw this, dumb-ass. I don't mean the **** AMC version, I'm talking DVD, IFC, or anything else that's uncut. And not **** CBC, don't waste your time with the damn tracers. Still, this movie is a very good combination of action, drug- hunting, and all the humor you'd expect from such an actor like John Travolta, not the greaser, John, but pretty much any other John. The good thing about this cult, no **** ending like all the Scary Movies, or the Hottie and the Nottie. Go see From Paris w/ Love..."

      "text": "I was thoroughly disappointed by From Paris with Love. Luc Besson's normally energetic and no-nonsense writing feels turgid, and director Pierre Morel has made films that are both more fun (District 13) and more consistent (Taken) than this sorry affair. Both leads are miscast - Johnathan Rhys Meyers' ambassador's assistant and part-time CIA operative James Reese quite remarkably manages to come across as both wooden and camp at the same time, and John Travolta's agent Charlie Wax is just an offensive, egotistic, fat old man who couldn't believably pull off half the stunts he does in this film (Travolta clearly has a good stunt man to do the tricky stuff, and the camera craftily cuts away whenever he's required to run). The plot is predictable, the representations of various ethnicities in Paris borderline offensive, and the action is unimaginative, and surprisingly infrequent for an action film. The only thing the film really does is raise the occasional smile with a few passable jokes (usually when Reese points out the ridiculousness of the situation, or when Travolta is particularly hammy) though even this is somewhat spoiled by a decision to crowbar in a reference to one of the lead actor's biggest hits. I'm sure said line was intended to be funny, but instead it just causes you to groan in deep embarrassment. From Paris with Love is only worth watching for the odd chuckle - it works on no other level, not as an action film, thriller, comment on terrorism and paranoia, not even as a buddy movie. It's merde, Monsieur Besson and Monsieur Morel, and you both need to have a long, hard think about where your careers are heading."

The plot kept twisting and turning, bringing one surprise after the other, which made it really interesting. Travolta was dynamic, fun and believable as a seemingly crazy but very able operative/spy. Jonathan Rhys Meyers was excellent in the role of the newbie operative who was fairly innocent and very inexperienced, but still smart. It was a far cry from the authority and power he exudes as King Henry in the Tudors series, which means to me that he's a capable actor."

      "text": "In the annals of the CIA, James Reese(Jonathan Rhys Meyers) deserves to go down as one of its worst operatives ever. While being brought into the secret intelligence fold, one of the first rules his handler must have impressed on the new recruit was that he trust nobody, especially the ladies. The moviegoer has seen the likes of \"From Paris with Love\" before, and is way, way, way ahead of our naive hero when Caroline(Kasia Smutniak) gives him an engagement ring before their romantic dinner on the apartment terrace. In an anterior scene, as Reese approaches the front door, he sees a red substance in the corridor(Reese! Bend down and check to see if it's blood! Taste it!), which is the filmmaker's pathetic attempt to misdirect the moviegoer into thinking that Caroline has no ulterior facet to the supposition in which she's merely the vulnerable girlfriend of a secret agent. \"From Paris with Love\" obscures Caroline's true identity by employing a MacGuffin, a cocaine ring in which Charlie Wax(John Travolta) and the fledgling CIA operative have to bust up. If the true nature of their partnership were revealed from the outset, all that John Woo-inspired action(Travolta as John Old-Fat.) would seem impertinent. And it does, once the real objective of their mission is stated, causing the moviegoer to wish that \"From Paris with Love\" was less like Michael Cimino's \"Year of the Dragon\"(or one of Woo's great Hong Kong films) and more like Julia Loktev's \"Day Night Day Night\". That's because it's hard to correlate the Caroline we're first introduced to: Reese's hot French girlfriend, beaming over an outfit she made out of curtains, with the finished product, the grim ideologue brainwashed by her fundamentalism. What makes Caroline tick? That's your movie, not shooting up Chinese restaurants. Like Nancy Kwan in Henry Koster's \"The Flower Drum Song\", Caroline clearly enjoys being a girl, so her double life plays like a plot contrivance to suit the explosive climax."

I was pleasantly surprised indeed, it doesn't have that \"love conquers all\" attitude that is infecting most films these days, not counting the ones that are deliberately depressive to make a name for themselves as the not-happy ones. Perhaps I'm a bit vindictive, but this movie pressed the right buttons and, without giving anything away, was smoothly satisfiying if you're a bit on the dark side."

If your looking for a movie that keep your attention for a movie night in, give this a movie a rent.

      "text": "Watching old-John Travolta was running, hopping, and climbing was very refreshing. It looks like he is trying to be Bourne. Thiz criminal-thriller was directed by Pierre Morel. The man is known as creditable Cinematographer, behind THE TRANSPORTER (2002), SOMETHING GOTTA GIVE (2003), and UNLEASHED (2005). In my point of view, Morel action scene is always excessive and hard to believe to happen in real situation, although is still entertaining. His directing credits are DISTRICT 13 (2004) and TAKEN (2008), which loved by most critics. Thiz side kick-action-adventure, Travolta accompanied by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who once again showed his skill by speaking Chinese language fluently in one of the scenes. The script had some potential to develop to be more interesting and interspaces with some funny scenes. The story is about an US ambassador assistant (Rhys Meyers) tasked to escort a special agent (Travolta) in some mysterious mission. Later, this mission also involve with Rhys Meyers character fianc\u00c3\u00a9 (Kasia Smutniak). The surprise character on thiz movie spotlights on Smutniak who just made her Hollywood debut. In my notes, thiz movie had some weaknesses on story-telling, by spoiling too much on its surprising elements. I already had a feeling where thiz story would goes to, even on the early scenes. The elements were too obvious to notice, (Spoiler Alert!) Bcoz the character played by unknown artist and shared too much screen (even on the beginning scenes). In one of the scenes, when Smutniak character were waving goodbye to her fianc\u00c3\u00a9 (Rhys Meyers), where the scene is too underline and the duration is too long, I already known definitely she will be the bad guy. Or just simply, if you sensitive enough, you could already found out on the title itself! Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"

Wanting more responsibility he is assigned to partner to secret agent Charlie Wax and soon begins to regret his decision.    A number of reviewers around the web have criticised this movie for its nonsensical plot and the fact that its characters make decisions for no other reason than to move us onto the next action sequence and, to be honest, they are right. Anyone watching this film hoping for a subtle thriller though has clearly come to the wrong place.    Thanks in large part to a brilliantly over the top performance from John Travolta as well as some great action scenes and a tongue in cheek sense of humour however From Paris with Love is a gripping, fast paced movie that is sure to entertain fans of the action genre."

Meyers often portrays very serious and one dimensional characters, but again he seems to be enjoying himself throughout the movie, the mismatch of leading actors certainly paid off as is proven by the surprising chemistry of the level-headed James Reese and the crazy Charlie Wax.\rThe writing certainly has its spark in moments, but this is very much a popcorn flick with plenty of brawling in the most unorthodox of circumstances and enough firepower to keep the bloodthirsty fans amused, it is what A Good Day to Die Hard should have been.\rFrom Paris with Love rightly prides itself in its absurdity, whether its hiding various weapon parts in energy drinks to get through airport customs, hanging out of a speeding car with a rocket launcher or the unbelievable plot which takes each and every twist and turn imaginable, it all equals out to an enjoyable flick that is easy on the eyes but not so much on the ears."

It's adequate and somewhat entertaining, but nowhere near as good as it should have been. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers stars a a junior C.I.A. agent, working out of the U.S. Embassy in Paris. Until now he's been asked to do simple things. His role quickly changes once and international terror cell sets up shop in his backyard. Rhys-Meyers is quickly paired with a veteran C.I.A. hit-man. The kind of guy you call when you want things done quickly and under the radar, but years of killing has taken it's toll. The mysterious man has become cold and reckless to a fault. The story here is painfully predictable, in a film that is about half as long as it should have been. Yes, the film is basically non-stop action, but it moves in such a way that the story is rushed to the point of confusion. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers was terrific in an opposites attract kind of way. John Travolta on the other hand was much too old and out of shape to be believable as this crazy, over the top hit-man. The chemistry between the two and the amazing non-stop action make this movie a pretty entertaining one, but the predictability and rushed story take too much away to make it the kind of film that keeps audiences buzzing after it's over."
