Maybe that's why I liked it.\r Someone did a great job choosing the locations - Singapore looks breathtaking. And you see a lot of it. Seriously, it actually makes you think, what are you doing spending you life in some other place? On the other hand, the more I think about the plot, the less I like it. It's not that ridiculous for an action movie - if you can accept the premise of genetically engineered assassins, it actually makes some sense. It's not that confusing - there is an organization that our Hitman and an army of other superkillers work for, and a rival organization trying to build a similar army by tracking down a geneticist, the original creator of the first army, through his daughter Katia (who is searching for her father on her own). Got it? What might be surprising is that the Hitman, who was sent to stop the rival organization, DOES NOT follow instructions and does not kill everyone whom he was ordered to. Some scenes and ideas are ridiculous (Katia disassembling both of Hitman's guns and leaving him and her seemingly defenseless, why? Because she was bored), I just ignored them waiting for something better to appear on the screen. Extra points, however, to the filmmakers for not making the pseudoscience in the movie so prominent that it ruins it (like it did ruin \"Lucy\" some time ago, for example, or most of the Marvel works - but I might be one of the few who dislike Marvel for it). My actual problem with \"Hitman: Agent 47\" was that I simply didn't like what Katia was turning into (or turning out to be?) during the course of the movie.\r No comment about the movie's similarity to the video games (which, I guess, there isn't any). Great cast (Zachary Quinto!)"

      "text": "A complete action pack, with not so popular actors.\r This is the second version, or we could say the reboot after the 2007 film did not receive well. This should have been a franchisee with at least 3-4 films by now. It's very clear that something is not working out for it. As for this film, there are several issues. But fairly did at the box office, which is poor for an action film like this. From the director who had never worked on any project before and the writers with good experiences.\r The money was well spent, the production quality was so good, then what is the trouble? Well, my first point out is the casting. Preferably someone top star who can pull the crowd into the cinema halls. Perhaps Jason Statham would have been a better choice, after Paul Walter's death who was suppose to play the lead. I'm not denying, but Rupert Friend was very good in the replace. But my point is there's no star value in this project, especially for the foreign markets, these lead stars are the strangers.\r The other drawbacks are, this film rated R, which is utterly pointless. Because there are no kisses, no sexy outfits, or drugs consumption, but only violence and gore which are mostly CGI works. Could you believe what the films are turned out to be nowadays. LOL. Though, I enjoyed the action sequences, so I can't thumb down and it does not enough to me to thumb up as well. Decent story with a speedy narration. Definitely an average film. Never seen Singapore better than in this film before. You could watch it for the time-pass and for the stunts, or in a situation when there are no other options available.\r 6/10"

      "text": "The first half of the film develops a new form of cinematography which can only be described as \"hallucinatory\". It was achieved thru a combination of non-sense dialogue, shaky camera, blurry lighting and pointless close-ups. The plot is a mess throughout the film but the first half was particularly awful. 47 was even the antagonist in the first half. No one really give a sh*t about some girl with superpower. The audiences are here to see 47 and assassination, not some girl with anxiety problems and some map that the camera never gives a clear view but keeps shaking in front of it.\r And we are certainly not here to see excessive BOOMs and BANGs. Sadly enough, this second 47 movie is still more about violence not assassination. Rubert Friend himself looks a lot more like a soldier than an assassin, so that's why he looks pretty good in the soldier outfit in the film. He is too young to be 47, and he is not cold enough. It is good to see some \"stealth\" element in this movie. The part when 47 \"trains\" Katia has something new and should be pretty interesting to hardcore fans. But such \"stealth\" is always followed by more excessive violence. Horrible.\r Superpower is certainly not acceptable in 47 series. Bullet-proof skin? This is not a Marvel movie. 47 admitting the opponent is stronger? That is not 47. 47 is always the best, although he is not perfect. That is one of the many beauties of Hitman. We don't need a superman or supervillain because that's just unreal. Katia's \"instinct\"-like power is not very acceptable either. In Hitman: Absolution, 47's instinct ability was achieved thru hard training, but Katia's power is more like a result of an implantation. After all, it is NEVER CLEARLY EXPLAINED in the entire film.\r The background of the Agency and Diana is never explained as well. Non-player audiences won't understand Diana's role in the plot. What's more astonishing is that 47 works against Diana, and Diana shows her face a lot (she may have never shown her face in the game. The one who died in Absolution might not be the real Diana), and...Diana is a Chinese! Are you f**king kidding me? Her voice is clearly using voice over because I know that Chinese actress doesn't speak good English. Why does western films use Chinese actress so often? A violence film like Hitman is gonna be censored by Chinese government anyway. BTW, she was using a stage name in the Cast (Angelababy), b*itchy, uh? And it was the first time that I see a film's cast is sorted in alphabetical order, so this \"Angel-a-baby\" could be on top. She must have slept with the producer. She is that notorious in China, really.\r Lack of continuation with the video game is another weakness of this film. We already have the girl Victoria who is likely to be a sidekick of 47, so why does the film reboot completely and introduce some new genetic scientist and some lady whose power is not so realistic? And eventually the film turned 47 against 48 who is supposed to be dead in the game long time ago. Plus the appearance of Mr. 48 does not even make sense because Katia is Miss. 90 already. Why would the Agency send one agent to fight one similar model and one superior model? Again, the plot is a mess. Please just stick with the game.\r There are some elements such as the \"stealth\" part I mentioned that are inherited the game. Another example is the bathing scene of Katia. It was a non-sense scene but it refers to the bathing Diana in Absolution. These are some sparks that players might find interesting, but for non-players, these are just some non-sense rubbish. The main dilemma for Hitman films so far is the difficulty of balancing traditional action elements and Hitman's stealth element. I think you can never achieve both the staggering visual effect and the \"silent kill\" philosophy of stealth games. It will take a grandmaster director who is also a Hitman fan to create a new genre of film, the stealth film. As much as I can imagine, it will be a film in a form like Run Lola Run in which 47 carefully plans his moves in his hideout, imagining different infiltration plans (some action elements may be applied here) until he find a way through, not touching the surrounding environment at all. Planning the moves is always the major beauty of Hitman games."

You can choose if you want to close a contract slow, stealthy and use maybe several hours, or do it the easy way: Kill all the \"bad guys\" and move on like in this movie. If 47 (Friend) would go stealthy all the way, this movie then would last for 5 and 1/2 hours. I liked this movie better that 2007, because Timothy Olyphant just didn't fit as 47. He fits to be a pedophile child molester better than an assassin, with his freakish face. Only thing I didn't like with Hitman: Agent 47, is that Katia could kick and kill everybody's asses.

Some of the more exuberant action scenes feel pulled from \"how to make a cheesy video game movie 101.\" However when taken at face value it can still provide some silly thrills. At the very least it manages to be better than the last Hitman movie.\r The action is where the cast majority of the entertainment value comes from. Director Aleksander Bach has crafted quite a few clever ways for Agent 47 to kill people. Of course the whole thing regularly goes off the deep end with it's absurdity, but for the most part it's (intentionally?) goofy fun to watch. The gorier kills are particularly entertaining.\r The plot itself isn't bad, but let's be honest who is going to watch this for the plot? It's the type of thing that works well enough to get things going and give a reason/excuse for the action onscreen to take place. So you just kind of go with knowing that if you really paid full attention to it that things would likely fall apart.\r The characters themselves aren't bad. Neither are the actors playing them. It's hard to really consider just how good the people onscreen are doing given the material. The exception being Rupert Friend. His (almost) emotionless performance does a great job of selling the character. Quinto is just there to play a stereotypical villain and Hannah Ware, despite being so integral to the plot, is just kind of around to show some PG-13 level skin for the teenage Hitman fans watching, as well as the older male gamers who never really grew up. Nobody else is worth mentioning.\r That's kind of the problem, not only with this new Hitman, but also with video game movies as a whole. Most of them are specifically designed to appeal to the players of the game. The problem with that? Apparently the people behind these movies view all gamers as horny 13 year olds who only care about the bang boom anyway. That and these same people don't know the source material well at all.\r So \"Agent 47\" hits quite a few of the pitfalls video game movies have made that gave them such a bad reputation in the first place. Does that mean it's not worth watching? Not necessarily. We are all at the point now where we know what to expect from video game movies. So long as you aren't/weren't expecting this to be the video game movie to change that, then you should be okay. Thankfully, somehow Rupert Friend and some decent, if occasionally overly cheesy action keep it from reaching the levels of suck other video game movies have attained, particularly the first attempt at a Hitman movie. So it has that going for it. It's a video game movie. Take it or leave it.\r 6.5/10"

If you asked me to buy it or recommend it, I would probably say no to buying and yes to watching it a few times every few years. The story is in the decent category. Agent 47 is contracted to find and eliminate a man who other Agents have failed to kill before. Then he meets a neo-Agent who just so happens to be the daughter of the creator of the Agent program. Also, there is a man who seemingly is immortal (getting shot and electrocuted just doesn\u2019t seem to cut it when killing villian\u2019s anymore). Now even though they added her as the pinnacle of the Agent legacy it still isn\u2019t that far-fetched to say it never happened in the story which makes it feasible that it could happen in the movie. This by itself added more to Hitman itself than just doing your run of the mill one man sneaky Rambo. It was unique and stayed true to the story.\tThe \u201cHollywood\u201d in this movie was pointlessly (but understandably) added to make this movie more bearable to watch. If we had 47 sneaking everywhere it wouldn\u2019t be fun to watch, now would it? That said, the gunfights in public were too outlandish for me.\tThe build up to the ending was great by the way. We started off thinking we knew who the target was and then found out it was someone (someone\u2019s) in this case. Good use of misleading us and in my opinion when its done in a way that drops hints but that we can\u2019t tell its coming then its okay in my book.\tOverall this movie is a decent one to watch, just don\u2019t let your dogmatic views cloud your view of what makes a movie good and you\u2019ll be able to watch this."

      "text": "Underneath the disguise of flashy cinematic and noise effects, Hitman: Agent 47 is sadly, still a misfire of corny script and abysmal plot.\r As an action flick, it's certainly brimming with cool choreography as characters partially dance and partially John Woo dive their way through hail of bullet. Unfortunately, the plot is nonsensical and inconsistent. It's understandable that the team wanted to create larger than life plot, but the process needs more delicacy than taking small scenes of the game and throws a bunch of popular gimmicks from Terminator to Minority Report, then hopes it would work or audience would suspend their belief.\r Story is the typical enhanced soldier theme. Granted, the video games used same narrative, but then it gets ridiculously over-the-top and even borderline supernatural. It follows Agent 47 (Rupert Friend) as he tries to find the scientist who pioneered the super soldier program by finding his daughter Katia (Hannah Ware).\r The movie revolves around finding this scientist and shady organization trying to revive the program. For a stoic character such as 47, the movie pairs him with female lead for more interaction, otherwise it'd be just all business and murder. It doesn't help that Katia is one dimensional and honestly equally stiff, the chemistry between them is hardly engaging.\r It's also odd that the multi-million organization and legendary assassins treats Katia as though she holds all the secret. The plot actually hinges entirely on her, and at times she even depicts as having clairvoyance skill. Script uses a lot of flamboyant one-liners, almost as in gibberish cat poster.\r With all of these quirky narrative and plot discrepancy, it's really hard to take the movie seriously. Story feels like a pretense to push the pace to next grand set pieces. To its credit, it does have plenty of stylish cinematography. Using all sorts of nifty choreography, dual wielding gunslinger combat in exotic places, it has ample bombastic action.\r Note that one of Hitman games actually titled Silent Assassin and it's also the highest rank in game. The cerebral or tactical approach is used sparsely, and those don't even appear natural. In fact, without the suit and Hitman on the title you wouldn't even recognize it as Hitman movie, probably some Universal Soldier spin-off.\r It's definitely an explosive spectacle, but sadly also a mindless one. If this is how video game is, still, translated to silver screen, it doesn't convey the game's core story, or any presentable story in general."

      "text": "Agent 47 is a return to the basic, crap old formula of video game movies. Despite having slick and amazing action sequences, 47 still retains its stupidity. The storyline is nothing special, in a jiffy, Zachary Quinto at his worst as a cop helping a girl to escape a supercool agent named Agent 47. That line describes the mishmash that was Hitman: Agent 47. It is gleefully violent, terribly long, horribly acted and has a rotten storyline that we have seen before. So, it's a seen-it all assassin movie right? Wrong. This movie gets the basics wrong. The first instalment was a fresher take on the video game. It was bad, but stupid, Friday night fun. See, both of the films bear no resemblance to the games, expect taking the bald action Hitman from them. Everything else is cheesy, rotten plot. Also, no fu**ing stealth! Timothy Oleympiant made a better Hitman than Rupert Friend. He was cool and all, but he had no charm that the previous had. Just a fact. Overall, a brain dead action movie with a few decent action scenes."

And I'm surprised how okay this movie was. This movie definitely has it share of pros and cons. The good aspects of this movie is:\r + Rupert Friend is convincing enough to be agent 47.\r+ Good action scenes.\r+ The locations.\r+ John Smith (played by Zachary Quinto) is decent enough as a villain.\r The bad aspects however is:\r - Katia (played by Hannah Ware) is one of the worst characters I've seen in a movie. Totally pointless. *Spoilers* We discovers later in the movie that she is not human, but a clone/agent programmed with higher senses. I would have liked this if it wasn't because of that Hannah Ware can't act in this movie.\r- The story is bad. I'm not going to spoil the ending, but let me say that the ending is not memorable.\r- Hitman is a stealth game, but this movie has only 1-3 stealth scenes and the rest is shoot outs with bloody results.\r- I haven't got a problem with slow motion, but this movie has too many pointless slow-mo scenes.\r I wouldn't recommend this movie. If you want to see it, rent it when it comes out on DVD/Blu-Ray."

      "text": "Ok so first of all, if you have never played the games or watched the first Hitman movie, you might enjoy this movie enough to not start crying over how much of a waste of time and money this was (If you are into action movies without any context, a meaningful storyline, interesting characters and sophisticated dialogues).\r So if you don't know the Hitman Universe basically you get:\r- Dialogues as deep as a saucer.\r- Supporting roles as interesting and charismatic as a pebble stone.\r- No context or reasons why everything happens.\r- Mediocre acting performance.\r- Sometimes forcefully inserted emotions as if the writers finished it and then spread \"twists\" and \"feelings\" over their work to make you care about the characters (which didn't work out very well).\r- Obvious and bad CGI.\rSo if you can live with those things then you will probably enjoy this movie because the action sequences and the fighting itself is pretty good.\rBut then if the movie fails at everything but the action, it needs more of it. (Hurts a bit saying that as a Hitman veteran but for fans like me is more further down in this review)\rSo in the end there could be more of the action instead of useless scenes which did nothing to 'story' development and made just no sense.\rIf i was to rate this movie without thinking about the Agent 47 i know, i would have had probably given this movie a 4 to 5 out of 10.\r So now for the Hitman fans:\rI re-watched the first Hitman movie and i really like that movie now thanks to this one.\rBecause it was at least a bit like the games.\rThe trademark of Agent 47 is stealth which was barely shown in the movie.\rThere were a handful of scenes where he would disguise or sneak up on enemies.\rBut it was not one bit thrilling to watch those scenes because there was no tension at all.\rAnd of course all the points as mentioned above count too, because even the old games had better stories, dialogues and interesting characters than this movie had.\rIn the end there were still some pretty decent scenes of Agent 47 just not giving a f*** and going on a killing spree which have their right to exist in Hitman since Hitman: Absolution.\rAlso Rupert Friend did a surprisingly good job portraying Agent 47. (The only character you would care for in this movie)\r To conclude:\rIf you're not a fan of the Hitman games and like action movies without deeper stories - go ahead give this movie a shot, it would be worth lending it from a video rental store.\rIf you're a fan of the series - believe me you are better off not spending any money for this thing."

      "text": "Can I hire a hitman for Hitman: Agent 47?\rHitman: Agent 47 is the game tie-in title that seemed like a decent idea for a movie.  I personally really liked the Hitman games, but this movie is NOT a Hitman movie.  It's supposed to be all about stealth and secrecy to take out the target.  This movie has over-the-top action, which was NOT what we expected.  Sure, what's there is pretty badass, but the acting is crap, and the story is stupid.  This movie is the true example of missed potential.  Honestly, after seeing this movie, i'm scared for the FNaF movie.\r Hitman: Agent 47 gets a 3/10."

We have disguises, smart fights, many guns and explosions and nice car's chasing. On the other hand, for those who are fans of the game, we don't have a movie that respects 100% its source. This adaptation doesn't full honor the game, except for some details on Agent 47 appearance and habilities. It ends giving us space for a sequel and probably new characters arriving but I've got the feeling that we won't get there."

Hitman: Agent 47 wasn't quite nearly as good as the 2007 Hitman movie (which is actually pretty decent), for whatever reason Fox has tried to bank on a wasted franchise potential, but Agent 47 is just as terrible as the name of the movie itself.\r The story is useless, the acting is dull, none of the action scenes weren't that special, it's just a carbon clone of The Matrix and Splinter Cell. Screw this movie if you can because there's no stealthing in this movie. That's exactly Strike 2 for Fox's ill-advised reboots, Fant4stic and Hitman: Agent 47."

      "text": "Somehow they turned a movie about Agent 47 into a movie about some chick who for some reason has the same abilities despite having zero training or experience. They just invented a mary sue for seemingly no reason. She has nothing to do with the games or previous films\r No explanation for this is given and the movie becomes entirely about her. The decision to make Agent 47 a sidekick in his own movie is nothing short of baffling. From the trailer she's barely shown because they knew a movie that wasn't about Agent 47 would be reviled.\r Fans will hate it, Agent 47's actor does a terrible job at emulating 47's coldness, the action is dull and predictable.\r My expectations were basically nothing and after 44 minutes I turned it off. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen.\r If you're trying to decide whether to torrent this or watch it, don't. Do something else with your 2 hours 30 minutes. Just about anything else will be better."
