I loved everything about it and highly recommend to any horror fan, period."

Not much really and the original exorcist film ignited peoples imaginations - but it seems that somehow films and possession just don't work that well - possibly because everyone knows the demons are no match for God and his exorcist servants - its kind of like a superhero movie - you know the bad guys will be defeated in the end - even if the hero has to shout \"Come into Me\" and jump out the window.\r This film does have its moments but overall the story is predictable and I thought it took way too long to get going for a 90 min film. The divorced parents, the grieving children, the dad having to put up with the ex-wifes jerky boyfriend, the dad who misses the school play because of work - etc etc.  Will they somehow overcome the evil and realize the most important thing is life is each other? Is their daughter just acting out when her eyes roll up in her head or moths start flying out of her mouth? Still to be fair - it was better than most of these types of films and they used a tripod. I looked into the true story this was based on and think it might have made a creepier film to explore the supposed actual events ( http://www.dibbukbox.com/story.htm) which were much less sensational -  and the concept of the dibbuk - which is not really a demon but a tormented human soul forced to remain on the earth after death.\r Still a lot of people in the audience were scared and therefore if you like this sort of thing - you'll probably enjoy it. More scares during the set up would have made it better."

Jeffrey Dean Morgan is an amazing actor, he plays the father really well, also like in Supernatural. Also this film is so unique, it makes its supernatural-ness feel much more natural. the dialogue/script is well written, this is a very smart scary film (esp. the back story montage, and also learning the name of the demon, Abyzou). More on that note, i've actually read the article/stories of people irl with a dibbuk box. I also love the cinematographer Dan Laustsen, his work is phenomenal hes known for Silent Hill and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen."

The acting was good for the most part, especially from the child actors, and the cinematography and score were beautiful and stylish, although the editing was absolutely atrocious. The last 20 minutes were especially scary and fun. I wasn't completely wowed by this movie because it lacked in the originality department, but it was a flat-out intense and entertaining flick."

      "text": "Picture the exorcist... Remove some of the most disturbing scenes and replace the priest by a Jew and you have the film figured out. The possession is not a bad movie, but the possessed child theme is an over-used formula. Either the movie takes the risk to be different with it or it tries to be better.... The possession achieves neither as it is very unlikely to surprise you with it's very familiar plot and characters. Now does it beat the original material it inspires itself from? It doesen't. The \"entity\" is a bit too shy. Sure you know it's there... But it doesen't do much. Even the parents take 3/4 of the movie before actually figuring out that the child is possessed. The movie actually starts really strong with a very creapy opening scene. I really loved the voices coming out of the box. But after 20-30 minutes it's the \"oh too familiar possessed kid scenario\", and for the next hour nothing really happens. I was struggling to stay awake. The last 20 minutes are good, but it takes way to much time to get there. The movie needs  a better pace, and  the story should focus on the box rather than a possessed child. The box scared me because i didn't know what was in it or what it could do. Once the entity from the box switches to the child, you are in familiar ground, you know what to expect. Don't get me wrong, the girl was creapy and scary, but again... i have seen that girl before in other movies and it just dosen't scare me anymore. I give the last 20 minutes a solid 8, but the first hour just dosen't give you enough to keep you sucked in so i have to go down to 6. If you just want a good scary movie, it's good enough. If you are a fan of movies likes the exrocist... don't expect much out of it."

The film is cliche and really just took too long to 'get into it' and by the time it did I had already lost interest. The acting is the only good part about this film really, apart from the Jewish guy who was hard too take seriously (you'll see what I mean). The editing is the most annoying thing about this film; it's very choppy and unorganized. The film will have an incredabley loud scene which will then cut to a silent scene and then a cliche horror movie soundtrack plays, this annoyed me so much. It probably happened over five times. Also the film isn't even scary, which really does just say it all, honestly I wouldn't bother with 'The Possession' it's dull and lifeless, you're better off watching the actual Exorcist."

Everybody, do not see this movie. 95% of it was laughable crap. I'll give it 5% of positivity, and that was in the 3rd act, but everything leading up to it was incredibly boring and like i said before, laughable. During one of the most serious parts of the film the jewish guy cracks a joke, like come on, really? This film is most certainly not worth the admission, do not waste your money or your time. 3/10"

The people really worked hard to make this movie what it is. Congrats to you all. I see people say that its like the exorcist, what do you expect, its a movie about demonic pessession. They're all going to be similer. And the kind of movie it is, it's going to be long. It's not like a regular action or thriller or a horror movie. i really like the actors and actress to. You can't just jump write in and thast's it. The begining was really good way to kick off the movie. The voices and the way they made the girl look like was really well done. This movie was really good."

The film will spend a good solid portion of time building this incredible suspense and drama and then, just while your balanced on the threshold of any resonance it violently cuts to black, a single piano note, and then the over-shot of some houses. This isn't a good technique, much to the point it's infuriating. The film had good moments, some excellent cinematography and I praise Natasha Calis and Madison Davenport I thought they both did an absolutely fantastic job and I see a bright future for them. Other than that, this film lacks any sort of depth. The ending in particular was extremely weak and predictable, a poor effort from an idea that could have potentially made a great film."

There is no action and suspense in the film and that's a negative point. It also doesn't tries to put yoi in an atmosphere. Really many things with similar films like the possession din't happen in that film. It didn't have many demon things. The Jew priest was an extremely bad idea, though I really liked the ending. It leaves you a message that they are going to make a new movie. Despite all that facts, If you like The Exorcist you might also find good the possession"

      "text": "In this film, which I think has become quite well-known, a young girl is attracted and ends up attaching herself too much to a mysterious wooden box full of Hebrew carvings. As her behavior changes and several people get hurt along the way, the girl's father is the first to realize that the box is the center of the whole problem. After research it, he discovers that the box is cursed and contains a spirit or demon inside, through ancient Jewish magic rituals.I saw this film recently but I already knew the true story where the film was inspired: an old wine box that supposedly trapped a spirit through Jewish magic. The story appeared on the Internet when the owners tried to sell this object and is well known to the world of Internet users and supernatural fans. I have my doubts about the veracity of these true story, but the fact is that it gave the film a good basis that that it develops very well, telling us a scary and intriguing story. It is similar to other films of exorcisms, possessions and cursed objects, a very explored genre, but it brings something original by showing Jewish beliefs and rituals instead of the much explored Catholic exorcism.The cast does what needs to be done. Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who has the lead role, is very good and has never seemed histrionic or forced. Natasha Calis, the tormented girl, gives us, in my humble opinion, one of the best children's performances in horror films I have seen in a long time. Both characters were well thought out and the way the film develops allows the audience to care about them. Kyra Sedgwick is also good but her character is annoying. I think the film takes the father's side in the marital issue that divides them, and this is reflected in the way Sedgwick's character was developed. The rest of the cast is limited to what they have to do, and Matisyahu was not happy. He takes part in the problem of that family without any clear reason (all the other Jews have left the subject), and he screams the devil's name so many times and so loudly that I got the impression that the devil must be deaf.Technically, its a discreet film. I don't know the budget, I didn't research about it, but it is possible that the producers were not swimming in dollars. The special and visual effects are there, they work, but they are discreet and without anything spectacular. The best production values is cinematography, with good fast-cut footage and lots of movement, well-placed aerial scenes and a skillful use of light and dark. We also have a soundtrack and simply excellent sound effects, which greatly intensify the tension and dramatic impact.In the middle of the garbage that is done every year in the horror genre, it is difficult to find something that is really good and worthwhile. But this film is worth it and deserves to be enjoyed."
