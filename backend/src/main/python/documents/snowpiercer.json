Collectively, I'm a fan of several of the actors and behind-the-scenes talent involved with this film, as well as its kind of dystopian setting, so although I knew little about the film I had high hopesfor it - sadly, they were soon dashed. Where to begin?\r There were just too many things wrong with it - for a train that's perpetually rocketing around the world, half the film featured zero sense of inertia or speed (even Star Trek's hams could wobble in their seats sometimes), as utterly stationary cast and equipment appeared stage-bound - apart from a few token sequences. We had a rocketing train that conveniently slowed wayyyy down at key expositional points (the Plane Below, the Frozen Exiles), as well as utterly bizarre casting decisions that were never explained (Jamie Bell's bizarre and somewhat patronising \"Shoite!\" 'Oirish' accent - why?!), while Hurt and Evans regularly over-emoted as though they going for an Academy award. (Just wait til the seemingly endless speech about what Evans used to eat...)\r Then, once the story started rolling along into the front, better-off section of the train, it absolutely rocketed into utter silliness. Yes, we get that they're all decadent, parasitic snobs living it up at the front - but did we need slo-mo Eurodisco shots to underline this? (Send in the gimps!) Derivative and dull to sit through, ticking one clich\u00e9d box after another, this was the point where I started considering what I could be doing instead of staying on board to the ending.\r The film's one - and only - saving grace is Tilda Swinton, who stole every scene with her perfidious Mason character. Half Gollum, half Northern English trade unionist, and half vintage Deirdre Barlow (Irish/British TV audiences will get that reference), her cowardly, sniping, mocking and treacherous ways were an absolute hoot to watch, with her hateful character proving unexpectedly entertaining in each and every scene she was in, while John Hurt was also a reliably engaging presence on screen.\r Unfortunately, one brilliant character and an okay-ish set-up do not an entertaining film make, and the initially interesting dystopian set-up soon derails into a cheap - and dare one say, almost grubby-feeling - Eurofilmesque tale, populated with flashes of jarring, stylised uber-violence, an inconsistent narrative, lazy editing, generally cheap-looking CGI/effects and a crashing bore of an ending.\r As such, it's 3 points for Tildy's turn, but a big, fat Zero for anything else..."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "I am befuddled by the generous scores given by all the professional critics.

It tried too hard though and it ends up as an unfortunate attempted cross between Brazil and any dumb action movie that you can name. I was disappointed because I liked The Host a lot but the dialogue here is poor, there is no characterisiation and the movie swings again and again from gory action to poorly-judged surreality to the detriment of both. the problem is that action movies demand one kind of logic, quirky surrealist fantasies another, and this film has none."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Ditto on being shocked at good reviews. Snowpiercer is not worth your money. The dialogue seems to have been written by grade school children, which doesn't leave much room for quality acting. The characters are Brazil / Gilliam campy but not as interesting (partly due to the awful dialogue). Also, the plot is recycled from already recycled dystopias and is very predictable. Ok, are you here for action then? Well, you can basically just throw away the fighting scenes, which also seem recycled from other, better Korean films. Do we really need another axe-fight scene? Do we really need another dystopian film of this type and quality? The plot holes are mind-blowing even if you suspend disbelief, the acting is poor, the characters are random and disposable, and the plot is as dumb as a couch.

In a way one can say that this is completely opposite to the Blade Runner world. While both are actually widening your eyes to behold the threat a film can possess on its society and history. The procedure is completely opposite. Now, one can argue that infinity is the final excelsior or that finiteness is the only excelsior. What cannot be ignored, is the fact Bong's film is a treat. A resource. That can be dug for years to come and still will bless the street with its light.As you might know by the logline of the film that it resembles a lot with the Noah's ark, the film is actually set in the future with the subtext that the history is repeating itself. And it is that irritation, the annoyance of the inevitable partiality; that is not politically motivated, but historically manipulated that stabs you and the characters in their heart. Even at the brink of humanity or arguably a new age ready to give birth, the human nature is told to be slave of the historians and the lessons they came up with.This is the commercial line. Incredibly rich. The struggling ones, the artists on the other hand are moving on by collecting what is present in front of their eyes possibly even capturing the moment like a photograph. And hence the reason why our sung hero, Chris Evans, the one, that embarks himself on a journey to move forward at a great price, that once again, his older generation had already paid.

Bong brought his science fiction classic to the screen, which is not only an effective work of entertainment, but also a profound philosophical reflection on the nature of man and the fate of humanity, dark and disturbing, desperate and appropriately chilling, but at the same time veined - as always in Bong - of savory irony and open, in the end, to a dazzling ray of hope."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "I really, really REALLY don't want to go for the obvious pun here, but there's no way around it: This movie is a train wreck.

The \"BIG PLOT TWIST\" at the end was so obvious, I accidentally predicted it in the first half an hour.\r I honestly have no idea how this movie was conceived.

Why does this Native American think he can survive in the frozen wastelands when the last people who tried didn't make it a mile, based on the fact that the snow has melted a little bit, yet it's still cold enough to freeze a man's arm off in seven minutes? How has this train come so close to derailing this many times in a few days, and yet it's kept on track for 18 years with no maintenance of the outside train, or the tracks it's traveling on?

A bunch of rebels armed with sticks defeat enemies with automatic weapons and night vision goggles IN THE DARK (with the rebels trapped on one end of a narrow car with a narrower passageway behind them) and over and over win other similar battles against similar odds?  The villain is an all-but-mustache-twirling/cat stroking condescending clich\u00e9.  This train is packed to the brim with unbelievability.

It's a powerful topic because it's as old as humanity and echoes to one of our core flaws as human beings: greed.\r But this whole concept goes out the window when there isn't any resource left to fight over anyway. Indeed the movie is about a bunch of people living in a small train in a post-apocalyptic world where there's nothing else left in the world! So what exactly is the point of having a bunch of people in that train starving to death for no reason when:\r a) they have enough food for everyone. It's clearly shown when you see how well the other passengers are living.\r b) those people aren't even working for the leisure of the \"upper class\", they aren't producing anything or working, they're literally just there to starve for no reason, simply as a plot device.\r c) they all live in a freaking small train, they're all miserable anyway. There's no \"good life\" to be had at the expense of others, unlike in the real world.\r The movie doesn't provide any answer, it's all form over substance, pure shock value with no understanding of the underlying issues that create those very real problems.\r But even with that aside it's just an all-around bad movie in general, with next to no character development, bad pacing, bad dialog.

When he shows him the bomb, it doesn't have any of the kronole chunks on it that he'd been collecting for opening the gates; the bomb is already built, AND he already had the matches.  Is there a reason....

Those are the movie i like the best. Thanks Bong Joon-ho!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "One of the best and smartest movies ever made.Great acting and visuals.

The rest of the movie doesn't deliver after what looks like an almost promising beginning. Even ignoring the plot holes, I feel everyone should of just died."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The plot holes in the movie kept me from liking it. There are literally more than 20 plot holes, certain ones are minor, and A LOT of the plot holes are major."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Oh my here we go again-an awful mindless movie almost completely without qualities except for having nice visuals and few serious actors involved gets insanely positive reviews from the world most eminent film critics.Those guys are obviously paid by studios and producers to write good things about bad movies-no other logical explanation-while some great pieces of cinema art passes almost totally unnoticed because there's no one to care about.So my question is:do we really need movie critics like this anymore?"}, {"rating": "1", "text": "This movie is so bad, I left the cinema after about 60% because I've had enough. Every movie with Chris Evans doesn't mean its a Captain America movie."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A stunning, visionary example of dystopian science-fiction cinema at its best, South Korean director Bong Joon-ho's \"Snowpiercer\" is based on the French graphic novel - a blockbuster rich in style that successfully breaks through cultural and political boundaries.\u201cSnowpiercer\u201d is brought to the big screen and offers a solid narrative, carefully drawn characters and \u2014 above all \u2014 respect for the audience\u2019s intelligence in high-concept genre cinema. While \u201cSnowpiercer\u201d and its world may be implausible, it's most certainly engaging, and further helping matters is Bong\u2019s impressive, sprawling international cast anchored by Chris Evan's strong central performance.\r \"Snowpiercer\" is set in a distant future where a man-made ecological disaster has triggered a new ice age that has engulfed the planet and killed off all but a few hundred lucky survivors. Upending the social structure of society and transposing it horizontally, the upper-class has become first-class on the Rattling Ark - a gigantic speed train that contains a literal microcosm of a contemporary neoliberal society. The fortunate in the front of the train rule over the rest, where the rich dictate the rules in order to oppress the poor and underprivileged.\r Bong\u2019s vivid depictions -- aided by Ondrej Nekvasil\u2019s production design and Hong Kyung-pyo\u2019s cinematography are beautifully orchestrated and captivating for the most part. That being said, one of the more significant issues with the film is the overuse of CGI in places, which does look sub-par at times, like stylized segments from a 1990's video game.\r Joon-ho creates an air of mystery and intrigue - as the passengers progress from the dark, rear tail of the train to the opulent splendour of the front carriages, \"Piecer\" evolves steadily, slowing providing information and further enriching its story with enough magic and wonder to suspend our disbelief entirely. The film's pacing is measured, but never slacks with adequate time taken out for nuanced, character-building scenes. You may recognize lots of inherent holes and flaws in its journey to salvation, but the movie confidently pushes its premise throughout its 126 minute run time.\r By the end, the film reveals itself as a surprisingly thoughtful contemplation projecting the problems of today into a science-fiction tomorrow, while it ties together a compelling story that continuously shifts. We all think we know what will happen here; the downtrodden are pushed to the limit, and as a result, they unite and rebel against their oppressors - exactly as we've seen countless times in a number of other sci-fi movies and it's all a bit predictable. \"Snowpiecer\" is the exception."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Lets start with the plot, or lack of it. Dumbest idea ever. How could you build a train track in harsh environment like that if they couldn't even go out in it? Not only that but the train never stopped and went around the world? Land masses don't connect! There is a plot hole. Who could sit 18 years in one little cramped space such as they were in? Not only that everyone dies except 2 people at the end. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE movie.\r Stupid critics the only reason why they liked it as I suppose this is supposed to be imitating life?? I guess if your a gay critic who jumps on board with everyone else or you live in a world where there is no hope, this movie is for you!"}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Biggest let down since RZA's Man With the Iron Fists. CGI is a laugh for a 2014 film and the story line doesn't challenge the audience at all. A story with as much depth as a greeting card is painfully drawn out for 2 hours. This wannabe Willy Wonka tale is a sad excuse of a film with a lack of imagination.\r The random Asian people, and random fish gutting was a testament that this film was begging to add depth to the film but only showed the lack of confidence the director had during the making of this film in hopes of hypnotizing a braindead audience. I cannot think of a worse film to compare this to and I've seen 300: Rise of an empire..."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "i'm giving this a 2 because of tilda swinton. she is a wonderfully fiendish bad guy. the bad teeth and great costuming are the icing on the cake. ed harris, too, is fantastic. oh, and i liked the idea of a giant train, hurtling through the frozen world. the rest of the movie is high budget crap. it careens from gorefest to quasi-surrealistic and back again. should've picked one theme and stuck with it. when i see dystopian films with the same old tropes--everyone in matching rags, starving, but not thin enough, all wearing fingerless gloves--i curse \"mad max\". that great film spawned so many wannabes."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "An intriguing premise, committed performance from Evans, and surprisingly good special effects, Snowpiercer is one of the better recent post-apocalyptic films."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Snowpiercer shouldn't work as a film, but somehow it does. The whole premise is so unlikely that most viewers would have to suspend disbelief just to watch it in the first place.\r The themes of survival, class warfare, and sustainability are all covered in the microcosm of a dystopian \"rattling ark.\" The storyline gives the viewers just enough information to draw conclusions about the world that they're witnessing and the cryptic symbolism gives audiences something to mull over (for example, what was the meaning of the fish blood ritual prior to the meelee sequence between the rebels and the train security forces? I'm assuming it correlates to Mason's later explanation of the aquarium later on and the idea of \"culling\" the population to keep things in balance).\r While the cast  performances overall were outstanding, I found Tilda Swinton to be particularly brilliant here as the comically draconian Mason; as was  Kang-ho Song as Nam, who is arguably the true protagonist of the film.\r Interestingly, I rented this on iTunes and watched it at home without realizing that it is a current release in theaters. I guess I like the trend of current releases being available on home video, but I also enjoy seeing movies on the big screen in a theater setting, so I hope the instant gratification of digital downloads doesn't make the theatre experience go completely \"extinct.\""}, {"rating": "3", "text": "-Really predictable\r-Scientifically silly - why would anyone have a train constantly in motion in a post-apocalyptic society let alone somehow maintain the ecosystem as described...on a train...\r-mediocre special effects\r-very unimaginative plot\r-the train concept is really absurd\r-this was more of a phantasy movie than sci-fi, really...\r +good acting especially by Chris Evans\r+good action scenes\r overall, i don't get what people see in this - it's certainly an allegory of modern/western/wealthy/wasteful life in a sense which is admirable but it doesn't need to be framed in such an inaccessible awkward way that this \"sci-fi\" attempts to do it"}], "recommendations": ["prometheus", "the_midnight_sky", "greenland", "stowaway", "district_9", "children_of_men", "geostorm", "sunshine", "jurassic_world_fallen_kingdom", "lucy", "the_tomorrow_war", "noah", "annihilation", "source_code", "the_titan", "the_first_purge", "the_kingdom", "jurassic_world_dominion", "how_it_ends", "elysium", "the_purge_anarchy", "eo", "the_purge_election_year", "28_weeks_later", "chaos_walking"]}
