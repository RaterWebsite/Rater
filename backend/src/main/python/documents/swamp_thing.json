Decent acting, fun special effects and pretty good story, it is a fun movie that doesn't try to take itself too seriously, it just tells it's story and leaves it at that. Is it the best Superhero film around? No, not even close. But is it worth watching? I think so, yes.http://latetothegame.blog/2019/01/19/key-movies-of-my-life-swamp-thing-1982-2"

It is a fun horror/sci-fi B-movie with okay acting, an okay soundtrack, great special (practical) effects, creepy and disturbing parts, a coherent story, a good cast, a decent and charismatic antagonist played well by Louis Jordan, fun action, and let\u2019s not forget Adrienne Barbeau. It\u2019s admittedly campy, but still a decent superhero film overall."
