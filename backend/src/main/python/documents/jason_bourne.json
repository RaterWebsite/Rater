But that was about as excited as i got. The movie itself was.......good, just.\r Firstly the action was great, exhilarating, tense, well choreographed. The acting was good, Matt Damon himself does a stellar job on his return to the character, the supporting cast was good too. The story was decent, but i couldn't help but feel it was useless. Nothing gets accomplished at all, Bourne just finds out a few things about his dad, there was really no other major threat. The movie itself just felt recycled.\r It was still a little enjoyable but it really wasn't necessary to the series."

This utter waste of celluloid isn't worth watching and for those who actually enjoyed and appreciated the first or third Bourne film, this is an insult. Don't let yourself be dragged into this pointless mess. It's also proof positive that actors and actresses have no morality at all when it comes to quality in film. Matt Damon, Alicia Vikander, Tommy Lee Jones and Vincent Cassel, you should all be ashamed. In order to maintain the status of a good or even a great actor, you can't prostitute yourself. You are totally diminished by this crap."

Bourne is lured out of hiding by his ex-CIA boss (Tommy Lee Jones) in an attempt to stop a dangerous data leak. Once it starts rolling, the film's momentum is non-stop, but most of the stunts have been done before (with the exception of a crazy chase scene thru Vegas that defies physics). The operations machinations keep the audience wondering what's next (and sometimes what's happening), but there aren't any surprises. Nothing new or exciting here, but the movie still supplies fast-paced, vigorous entertainment."

Julia Styles on the back..its was exciting but the next two were pure overkill . Enough of the chases scenes and elaborate property damage. 2016 directors do not understand or appreciate subtlety in their films. Less is more . Other than that, film had good pacing and left a little hook at the very end to entice interest in the next segment"

      "text": "Jason Bourne is another very disappointing entry into the Bourne franchise. The plot slacks considerably under the weight of Paul Greengrass' shaky cam, unnecessarily large action set pieces, and nauseating action towards the end of the film. The Bourne films have always been remarkably built around their plot, not just huge action scenes. Here, however, this is thrown to the side for a bombastic, too loud, and over-the-top film that instead of being a unique action spy film, turns this entry into the beloved franchise into just another cookie cutter action film. The acting is solid across the board and whatever plot that exists is solid, but the film seems far too eager to just skim through the story and get back to explosions. Even worse, Greengrass' affection for shaky cam leaves these fight and chase scenes completely unwatchable. The original trilogy was far more grounded and balanced, but this sequel is far too reliant on action and casts aside any semblance of a plot as a result."

      "text": "Despite bringing what everyone loves about Jason Bourne back to the big screen, Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon fail to deliver an entry to the franchise that matches the previous instalments. Early on in the film we see Bourne living off the grid, partaking in street fighting to keep himself sane, even allowing himself to receive a beating to combat his guilt, however this interesting direction for the character is short lived and soon he is thrust into the same old scenario we have seen before only this time for a rather contrived motivation. Typical screenplay tropes litter the script and at times the story feels muddied and ham-fisted. A sub-pot merges into the A-story without really feeling developed and characters suddenly have different rules of engagement depending on what best serves the story. Having said all that the action scenes are directed with perfection as you would expect, and the fight sequences are as realistic as ever. Damon Vs Cassel is the biggest draw and when they share the screen the outcome is explosive. A chase through the streets of Vegas is solid, although not up to previous film's final chases, and the opening Athens set piece is high octane stuff. The film is a solid action film but unfortunately holds no patch to the initial trilogy. It does wipe the floor with the Renner led spin-off but you can't help but feel this flawed entry was unneeded."

So yeah too sum it up it's narratively unsatisfying, and largely pointless, leaving you with a feeling of why did they bother?"

      "text": "Matt Damon returns as Jason Bourne in the fifth entry of the Bourne saga, which still entertains after some years off-screen. Though I still believe the Bourne Ultimatum is the best in the series, the movie still delivers with some action-packed sequences and thought- provoking characters. Directed by Paul Greengrass, who was also at the helm with Bourne Supremacy and Bourne Ultimatum, the movie is able to bring back some of things that made the original Bourne trilogy so good, in particular the incredibly awesome action pieces that are sprayed all throughout the film. It also showcases Paul's signature use of a shaky-camera, and though unconventional, proves to be useful in many situations.Almost a decade after the end of the Bourne Ultimatum, Bourne (Matt Damon) is still hiding, isolated from the world, where he only joins up in the occasional street-fight. But, his involvement begins when former contact of Bourne, Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles), hacks into the CIA server in attempt to expose information. Files concerning the identity of Jason Bourne and how they attempt to take him down brings him out of hiding.The film boasts a stellar cast, which includes Matt Damon, Alicia Vikander, Tommy Lee Jones, and Vincent Cassel, all who of whom suited their characters well within the story. The story itself wasn't as intriguing as many of other Bourne films, as there were some minor plot-holes, but it didn't concern me that much. Its ability blends a decent plot with amazing action provides a fulfilling experience for the viewer, in particular, those who are fans of the series."

Bourne is found, needs to uncover something, run from CIA white collars in a computer lab, face off with a rival agent, car chase, fist fight, confront the shot caller in the suit, disappear, been there, done that. Can't they get any more creative with the premise? At least Legacy tried branching out a little. My biggest disappointment is the return of the overdone shakycam. Ffs, even the text you're supposed to be reading is all but illegible it's so bad. Anyway, the action is alright (Damon's age may be catching up with him), but to its credit the climactic car chase is pretty damn awesome. Altogether uninspired, though."

Not only is the editing frenetic, way over the top and confusing, there is such a thin plot, so overstuffed with special effects and people walking around different citites glaring at each other and stalking each other, that it's almost ludicrous. The \"motivation\" for poor Jason iis a story that has been told so many times before, in so many other movies, that it just produces a sigh of annoyance when it is finally revealed. If you want headache inducing quick cuts, over real character (Jason has been reduced to some kind of superhuman robot who seemingly can't be killed). Matt Damon has become two dimensional and the director gives him nothing to act against. There is good, there is evil. There is violence, there is some tension, but whoever thinks that watching a computer download files over and over again while someone stares at the screen, should rethink what is inherently dramatic. In one early scene, which seems never to end, we have rioting, fires, chases, shooting, treachery, death, injury, the obligatory car chases, helicopters, glaring (again) evil people, grim (again) good people. This overstuffed sandwich induces nausea. We see Jason in Greece, fighting, being stalked by the evil people. We see Jason in  Berlin, fighting and being stalked by the evil people. We see Jason in London, fighting, and being stalked by the evil people. If bigger is better, you'll like this movie. If you don't care about real plot, real character, or true dramatic tension, you'll  like this movie. For me, no more Jason Bourne."

However, as entertaining and action-packed as the film was, I can honestly say that I think this was probably the weakest of his Bourne films (it still beats Jeremy Renner's Bourne Legacy.) This offered some more great fight sequences, however, the noticeably choppy editing and camerawork made it hard to really enjoy at times. I also found the final chase sequence to be rather dumbed down and destruction-heavy, as I enjoyed and appreciated the intelligence and restraint of the chase sequences from the previous 3 Damon films. As for the story, it kinda felt like more of the same. Bourne tries to run from the CIA and has to find out why they're after him (again.) Overall, Matt Damon does a fine job doing what he does best, but it isn't his fault that the story's repetitive feel and the all-over-the-place editing and cinematography weighed it down. It was still fun at times but left me feeling underwhelmed and slightly disappointed that it wasn't a lot better, especially after the nine years since Ultimatum."

It is an injustice the incompetent director is allowed to make movies.  His signature style was used to appropriate effect in \"United 93\" and somehow didn't ruin the excellent \"Captain Phillips\" (10 rating here), but that may be because that was not an action movie and Greengrass didn't have justification to warrant going overboard on the visceral moving cam - cut to ribbons bull---- style of his.  Also an important factor is that real events re-created is an entirely different frame of mind than big dumb popcorn fiction like this movie, which no matter how much phony reality is artificially injected into the moviemaking, we all never forget this s---- is all play pretend time make believe.  Whatever the case, this idiot is a menace to cinemas most of the time.  Nobody in power bothers to really question the s----- style.  Not the studio monkeys, not the producers, not the stars.  All a herd of sheep producing pure manure that only fertilizes their jackass egos, certainly not the audience.  Kinetic action does not require shaky dumbed down cell phone quality documentary v\u00e9rit\u00e9.  The eye doesn't even truly ever see that way no matter how jostled.  Nor does the audience deserve to be paying admission to only be annoyed and sickened by it!  This already pass\u00e9 style of cinematic action doesn't raise the bar, it lowers it idiots!  It's incoherent and unintelligible!  You can't even tell what's going on most of the time!  And it's easier to manufacture this kind of bs handheld photography and anything goes editorial.  Total junk!\rBy comparison, the first movie in the series made by others and without this s--- style was good (7 rating) and the last one also directed by another without this s--- style and with a different lead actor was marginal but not infuriating (maybe a 5).\r Damon though a very good actor and maybe very solid person in life is simply not likable enough a personality on screen to have ever become a real movie star.  Disagree with that, but he just isn't in the same league as movie stars past which points to a larger issue at the movies today.\r What an excruciating, unbearable soulless bore!

      "text": "The Bourne movies have always tiptoed around the contradiction that their main character is supposed to be a reformed assassin who just wants to live in peace, but all their entertainment value comes from watching him ultra-competently kick ass, crash cars, and blow stuff up. In between these scenes they get weighed down by his morose brooding and sulking about the people he killed, cars he crashed, etc. As a result they've always been rather joyless and unsatisfying compared to something like Die Hard or Taken, where the hero is fighting for people he loves and believes in the moral rightness of his actions.\r I don't have much to say about this specific movie except to note that it's a ridiculously cynical and inessential copy-paste exercise that brings nothing new to the franchise, and that Damon's face has aged really badly. He looks all pinched and gross now, one might say \"like a Streisand\"."

The story, the writing, the dialogue, the action sequences, the acting, the directing, the editing, the music. It was a a chore to sit through. I can't believe people actually liked this POS. But then again, people enjoy the Fast & Furious series, with cars driving through skyscrapers and such."

Paul Greengrass is one of the worst directors of our generation.  If you want to watch this movie but don't want to pay the money, just spin in circles until your so dizzy you're about to vomit and then watch Bourne Identity 1 on blu ray while randomly hitting pause, play, pause play..  It will be about the same thing."

      "text": "Eh, it was OK. You might want to wait and rent it. My expectations of home rentals are lower, so if you're like me in that way, you'll enjoy it more at home. When you actually go out, park somewhere, stand in line, pay for a ticket, and stand in line again to pay for overpriced popcorn, then sit with someone's head partly in the way, you expect more for your trouble. The best Bourne movies for me are the first one and the 4th one, the one Bourne isn't even in. This one is on par with 3 but maybe not as good as 2. The problem I had with this is that, look, I know I'm not going to get tons of character development, but in place of that I at least want a plot with revelations and twists and turns. But you get none of that here. You just get a simple excuse for a plot with 3 or 4 words of dialogue once in a while to push the thin plot onward, but 99% of the movie is insane action, and in this case the camerawork was so close up all the time that it was disorienting and a little nausea inducing like the Blair Witch Project. The Blair Witch Project promoters liked to brag that viewers were throwing up in the theater - which suggested the movie was incredibly gross and frightening - but in fact people were puking because the camera work was hand-held and looking at the ground half the time and jiggling and bumping all over so that people got sea sick. Jason Bourne isn't that bad visually but it's pretty bad. Handheld cameras and close shots even during action are fine as a tool in the toolbox to use here and there to get very intense, to highlight a climactic, moment, but when you do it all the time it becomes just a meaningless blur, and that was kind of what you had here. That said, the acting, what there was of it, was good. Perhaps I give it a 6 rather than a 4 or 3 simply because I've seen the previous Bournes so I knew what I was in for when I entered the theater. I'm calibrating it against other Bourne movies rather than against other action movies generally."

      "text": "Whilst not as powerful as the original three films, the latest Jason Bourne reboot is an entertaining action film. The story, dialogue and character development is slightly lacking in comparison to the predecessors, with the focus on action rather than substance for a lot of the film. Despite this, it is still a Bourne movie and shows reasonably good signs for potential future instalments."

      "text": "A solid addition to the series, with all the action we've come to love from the series, albeit at times the narrative was lost behind the action. Sometimes it wasn't apparent why Bourne was doing what he was doing or going where he was going, only that there were more people to kill at his next destination. Despite this the story was solid and leaves good space for a number of sequels, which I for one will be watching."

      "text": "Definitely not a bad movie, and you'll have some fun with it (esp Vikander and the dude from Elementary), but it just feels a little uninspired. The storyline is pedestrian compared to the previous films, and that's mostly a compliment to those films.  I mean, this is not like the last Die Hard, which SUCKED, regardless of how good or bad the previous Die Hards were.  The final chase/fight sequence in Jason Bourne just seemed to last forever, and I really hate when they get TOO close to the action to hide the fact that what they're filming is just not that compelling."

      "text": "If you're a fan of hard hitting action with tons of cool fight scenes involving Jason Bourne beating the crap out of people, then this movie is for you. Matt Damon returns as Jason Bourne added to a great performance by Tommy Lee Jones, Riz Ahmed, Alicia Vikander, and Vincent Cassel but as entertaining and action-packed as it is, I felt that this had to be one of the weaker adaptions into the Bourne series. While it was definitely a vast improvement over Jeremy Renners \"Legacy,\" the movie still pales in comparison to Ultimatum, Identity and Supremacy. Despite this, I still really enjoyed this movie and I felt it as a welcomed edition to the Bourne series."

Acting was so sad it was nothing in it that was surprising , it just felt from the beginning to the end of the movie they're chasing after him ........chasing scenes after chasing scenes.....just boring.  They should just quit while you're ahead and don't make anymore these movies"
