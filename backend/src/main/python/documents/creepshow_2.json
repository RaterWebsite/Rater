In the second, four teens are stranded on a raft on a lake with a blob that is hungry. And in the third, a hit and run woman is terrorized by the hitchhiker she accidentally killed... or did she?",

When I saw it during its theatrical run, my parents got offended and made us leave about halfway through. So it was years later as an adult that I revisited it, and although it wasn't very scary, it had a few great lines and memorable scenes. \"Thanks for the ride, lady!\""
