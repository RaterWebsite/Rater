I think the director couldn't decide how to handle this movie, some parts are way over the top comic book movie, but some parts are trying to be darker and more serious. Sadly, because of this the movie is all over the place. With a better director, this movie could have been so much better"

By the result in the film there is only one element that succeeded - acting Mads Mikkelsen."

There is an audience, in people who don't like to think, I guess.

In that time, the film manages to have zero tension, tedious action scenes, jokes that fall flat, and an attitude to women that comes across as perhaps the most unsexy attempt at sexualisation I've ever seen. Even the music is boring.Does a fat man shot in the testicles with a nail gun sound funny to you? Does an obese man being called \"meatloaf\" while he is strangled? Do you like the idea of someone with just enough charisma to be a sidekick being cast as a flamboyant villain? How about a boring action scene in which someone is shot, and then some other people meander towards them and shoot him a couple more times, does that sound enjoyable?Watch John Wick, or Kingsman: Secret Service, or Kick-ass.

Mads Mikkelsen is excellent in this role, and it's worth watching for him, alone.The first act is too cartoonish, as all of the main characters are introduced with their own title sequence. Honestly, no one cares about that. Most of those names are of no importance to the storyline. The only name you need to know is the main character (Duncan).But this movie gets progressively better, and finishes with a strong third act.The critics are really trashing this film, but honestly, I don't see it as all that different from similar films made from ultra-violent graphic novels.

They don't want to silence him, they want to kill him so they don't have to pay him his pension. You could tell that this film was done by Jonas Akerlund because of all the satanic/masonic/illuminati production scenes. It even seemed as though many of the costumes Katheryn Winnick wore came from Bea Akerlund's closet. They even had Richard Dreyfuss *grand master mason* and *32nd degree Scottish Rite mason* to round out the mason symbology. Lots of gore. Some nakedness and sex. A lame script and a few good scenes with Mads. Oh, every time I saw Matt Lucas all I could think of was Vicky Pollard from Little Britain trading her baby for a Westlife cd.I found this movie to be derivative, predictable, and way over the top. The ending leads us to believe there will be a sequel but I won't be back for it. It's a solid 3 out of 10 stars."

It is a bad movie.Mads Mikkelsen is indisputably a cool guy, the Danish Idris Elba, as it were, and his more contemplative half of the movie with Vanessa Hudgens in the snowy town is pretty ok. Even some of the humor there works. The action scenes, of which there aren't really that many, are also ok. If the movie had remained on that level, it'd be about a 6.Unfortunately the other half is embarrassing cheesy trash trying so hard and failing so abysmally at creating scenes similar to ones from cool movies made by people with talent. At no point does it even come close. It's seriously Uwe Boll level. Just revolting, absolute hack garbage. The people responsible should feel ashamed and owe Mads an apology.

Yes, I have big Sony HDTV, but for some reason more Clear and Crisp than most films that I have seen lately. Maybe my eye sight is improving or this film was done in some really awesome video camera work, Idk. Should have higher reviews. I am house bound and watch movies everyday for many years.

The plot is unremarkable, you've seen it dozens of times before, but the violent antics of Duncan (Mads M) and the Suicide Squad-like kill team are just shocking. Vanessa Hudgens attempts to ditch her cute-ness with a gritty drama role but it works about as well as dressing a kitten in a cowboy hat, still cute, sorry, so that's a casting miss and if you dwell on it too much can ruin the otherwise dark, violent vibe throughout. Kadee Strickland or Dawn Olivieri would've been a FAR better choice. Camille (Vanessa) doesn't have the commitment in the end to do what should be done, so we have the germ of the sequel which would include even more of Vanessa, so no thanks."

      "text": "I've been an avid user of metacritic for years now but that is the first time I feel the need to create an account to write a review.This movie. Oh my god.Let's get this straight, I actually give it 1 because of Mads Mikkelsen whom is an amazing actor. That's it.First of all, I totally despise Rotten Tomatoes and this Actor Studio driven movement that believes movies must always lead to something incredible that will change your life. Now with that said:Most of us are probably aware that some people actually set the level of the worst director ever to a pretty high standard. So before seeing this movie, I didn't believe you could get any worse that Paul W.S. Anderson at making action movies. Let's face it, this Resident Evil (movie) franchise is dreadful. But now I'm reconsidering. I mean, this is taking bad directing to a whole new level. Jonas \u00c5kerlund actually succeeded at making a movie starring Mads Mikkelsen, produced by Netflix with a O.S.T. made by deadmau5 one of the worst thing ever. This takes some serious investment at being bad.The story is totally dull but we can totally live with it in an action movie so that's perfectly fine. Except for the final plot twist that is just unacceptable and hasn't been properly built during the movie. Plus the plot is so convoluted and the character unremarkable that you won't even remember if you saw a character before when noticing him/her in a scene.Now the action scene could all be terrific. Like really terrific. But the movie takes it too far. Like the scene in the hallway when Duncan escapes. This actually started great, but after a few dozen guards this was just entirely moronic. The director actually spent a lot of time in fighting scenes with unknown guards and soldiers and NONE with the actual villain of the movie. Even if this guy would have been killed instantly we should haven seen that on screen instead of a CGI head thrown out of a window. That was a comic relief attempt at a moment that just did not fit comic relief and which was supposed to be the pinnacle of action.Now I'm not a big fan of abstract sex scenes with a romantic flavor to it in movies. I think they bring nothing to movies and they are pretty pointless. I can accept those in movies however since they always have been mainstream so why not. I actually prefer sex scenes like Game of Thrones which are more graphic but serves a purpose to the story or plot. This film has neither. This is just borderline pornography. I could have accepted the first scenes but the one between Mads Mikkelsen and Ruby O Fee is just moronic. You don't even understand if Duncan is aware of what's going or not. Was he lucky? When did he notice? That's plain bad.Apparently the villain has better guards than his \"A-Team\". Guards can actually resist Duncan longer than this bunch of idiots. They can't even hurt him while random dudes put 2 bullets in Duncan. What is this \"A-Team\" even here for? You don't have time to care about them since they all die so fast without any real build up between them except so scenes depicting them as brain dead teenagers.In fact, nothing is properly built up during this movie, the first part is just Duncan doing random stuff that will never ever matter in the movie. At first I even thought he was in love with the girl from the cabin. I can't remember her name since she is so dull! Then you get the \"A-Team\" killing a bunch of people we never heard about nor care about. Then stuff happens that is so random you won't even remember it after seeing this movie. And then the bad guy dies.There is actually something that made a lot of sense: The guards just get the hell out of the building when Duncan arrives after killing like 100 of them in the prison. That was actually a good idea. I would honestly get the hell out as well because Mr. Blut is nowhere charismatic enough to be protected with one's life.How can you cancel a show like Hannibal and then get this **** out on screen? Please ask Jonas \u00c5kerlund to refund all the budget from this movie and use it for another season of Hannibal."

The villain Blut was more of a clown than a menace. And Vanessa's Camille was simply the product of bad writing. And lastly I found the banter between the group of younger assassins irritating at times. I guess the movie makers decided to throw in gratuitous violence to cover up poor writing.
