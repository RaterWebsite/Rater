The lead actor's performance is riveting, frustrating, heartbreaking. I have no idea how often a child's claim of this type of abuse turns out to be false, but the film makes an interesting case for how this seemingly impossible thing could happen. Also interesting is the fact that after \"The Celebration,\" his earlier film that explores some similar issues in a scathing way, the director this time narrows his focus to the accused. Great filmmaking."

This causes the majority of the small Swedish village to turn viciously against him. This film is stark and bleak (it is, after all Sweden). There's almost no music or manipulative filmmaking by director Thomas Vinterberg (\"Celebration\"). Still, it packs a powerful punch.

People do not forget and do not forgive even if you are innocent...\rI find the movie excellent but the ending brilliant.

From the baseless accusation to the brainwashed belief of clearly unfounded lies to the way he is treated in the aftermath is just so aggravating. In this way, the film is brilliant. I had to pause many a time to just try and collect myself a bit and not punch my computer screen. Mads Mikkelsen is absolutely stunning in this film and turns in a terrifically believable and authentic performance as the accused teacher. The film does a great job portraying the hysteria that surrounds an accusation of this magnitude and the resulting anger and confusion. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking at times and the direction from Thomas Vinterberg is fantastic. Overall, The Hunt is a great film that may move slow at times, but really sucks you in and makes you feel something for the protagonist as you watch this injustice take place."

      "text": "Back in 1998, Danish filmmaker Thomas Vinterberg shook up the cinematic establishment with \"The Celebration,\" a devastatingly powerful debut which explores shocking revelations and the power of a lie, and the incalculable, irreparable damage it can cause. Fourteen years later, Vinterberg returns with \"The Hunt,\" which shares many similarities with its celebrated predecessor, and it has received high praise at both the Cannes and London film festivals. \"The Hunt,\" a Palme d'Or nominee, revisits familiar ground, where Vinterberg continues to fan the flames of social unrest in a far more conventional manner.\r Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is a kindergarten teacher in a small, hunting village in Denmark, who is recovering from a painful divorce and working to receive greater custody of his teenage son. He is best friends with the couple that lives next door, Theo and Agnes (Larsen and Hassing), and has a fond relationship with their daughter Klara (Wedderkopp), who is also one of his young pupils. One day, the young girl says some odd things which imply that Lucas is a sexual predator. Suddenly, the town closes ranks against him, and everyone assumes that children don't lie about such things. Klara, though she tries, is unable to take back her words.\r It\u2019s a childlike act of revenge orchestrated by a little girl who doesn't know any better, and who is trying to avoid further embarrassment or torment. However, the narrative of the story is driven by the adults of this small town. Quickly shunned by a community that once welcomed him, Lucas is left to absorb the nightmare alone, finding even his closest companions unsure of his innocence.\r Vinterberg maintains a human focus to the story, emphasizing strained relationships and universal suspicion, while capturing the essence of despair as the characters struggle to make sense out of a confusing and volatile situation. \"The Hunt\u201d is unsettling and enraging to watch because of Lindholm\u2019s forceful script and the incredibly vivid performances, most notably Mikkelsen\u2019s sensational performance as the condemned man. The film's premise isn't anything particularly new, however, Mikkelsen's powerful performance creates a strong sense of empathy for Lucas which transcends this engrossing nightmare, where simply surviving doesn't mean your days as a target are over."

Now if Vinterberg consciously knows how a proper interview of a 5/6 year old should be done, and he chose to have him screw it up, then OK.  Otherwise that part was not handled right, meaning inaccurate script.\rAfter that I thought everything was realistic & believable & very well done.  These days in my book great acting is pretty well a given.  The lead character was excellent.\rI also had trouble with the ending.  It was going great, he helps the little girl get across the lines in the floor,\rbeautiful.  But the last scene when he is shot at.  I actually thought it was kind of Hollywood.\rIt's not the celebration but still well worth seeing"

Klara, a child with a vivid imagination, is fascinated by Lucas to whom she gives a kiss and a heart of nails. Rejected with sweetness and determination, Lucas invites the little girl to give it to a companion. Klara doesn't like it and tells the principal that she has been subjected to the sexual attention of the teacher.

Mads (the face) Mikkelsen is wonderful as the innocent accused in the village of the happy Danes that turns into the Village of the Damned.

During the watch, my head was full with questions - \"What the hell?\", \"Why everything is going so slowly?\", \"What was the purpose of that scene to be here\". Confusing characters, they were all so damn confused, annoyingly shy and boring. Also you are going to hate that damn annoying little girl.. and everyone as well. Repulsive atmosphere. I guess just bad directing.When something terrible happens, people have misunderstand, thinking that you have done something so wrong, something real bad, but.. surprisingly you haven't *surprise surprise*, you just don't sit there and watch as a tree how people look at you, tread you and generally thing of you. You fight for your right, you speak, you just do something, maybe!!? I would describe the protagonist's actions as unconvincing and insufficient.The the end of the movie says, that when you do something wrong, no matter if people are mistaken, when you said something wrong, even if you were angry or very emotional and when it's been a while, you will be remembered with that thing you did or say forever. People recall bad stuff, situations and actions for other people. At the end of the day, nobody wants to be remembered as the bad and nasty guy.

Just short example: first - psychologist or whoever he was (first to question the girl) would never be a man and secondly, no one in the world uses such direct questioning. Next, teacher has no right to initiate any said questioning, especially without any parental approval and sadly everything falls apart from there, because everything that goes on from that moment would not have happen in real functional world.

The movie\u2019s concept, whereby the main character suffers societal injustice,  is all too familiar in the face of today\u2019s \u201ccancel culture\u201d and the greater flaw of human communication, i.e. miscommunication. All the children actors are very well cast and serve their roles well. Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is a man who has been beaten into submission by society regarding his marriage, his child, and now his job. Lucas is being forced to give in and give up on the things he loves and enjoys and is ostracized by those who used to be his closest friends. The Hunt is a character study detailing how desperation and innocence can combine to form apparent guilt. The Hunt is shot in such a way that we feel the stigmas of the town and feel how despicable of a person Lucas seems to be, all while knowing that it isn\u2019t true. We are led to believe that friendships are as strong as limp fetters and quickly turn to backstabs. Ultimately, The Hunt shows that the fundamentally flawed credibility of a system wherein guilt is implied and fake news is a given."
