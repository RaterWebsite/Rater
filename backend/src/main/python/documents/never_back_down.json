After being trounced by Ryan in front of the entire school, Jake begins training under the firm, moral guidance of a MMA master, where he learns how to fight... and how to avoid a fight. But it becomes obvious that a rematch will be inevitable if Jake wants to stop Ryan and his bullying, once and for all.",

My advice, skip this UFC+The Karate Kid+The O.C.=C.R.A.P. movie and just go rent or buy \"The Karate Kid\", its probably cheap than \"Never Back Down\" and its a WAY better film."

Athlete or thug? \"Never Back Down\" doesn't try to boost the sport of mixed-martial arts, which makes \"Never Back Down\" somewhat watchable, without ever being particularly good. If you're old school(here's the test: Do you know what OMD stands for?), you'll wonder why nobody calls the cops. Had \"Never Back Down\" wanted to legitimize the sport, Jake(Sean Faris) and Ryan(Cam Gigandet) would square off in an official tournament. The sport maintains its outsider status, but it does so in the unlikeliest of venues; a high school, which makes \"Never Back Down\" look like \"Fight Club 90210\". It's the strangest sight to see all these well-groomed boys and girls cheering on two preppie gladiators in a knock-down-drag-'em-out fight. Amber(Baja Miller) is a freak; all the girls are, in this \"Karate Kid(The)\" update. They want to see blood. They don't look shy away from pain and suffering like girls used to, say, in 1984, the year of \"sweep the leg\". I'm pretty sure Ali(Elizabeth Shue) flinched each time Daniel(Ralph Macchio) got hit."

The way I see it every review that judges this movie either on the grounds of anti-semitism or violence is redundant and false because the Jews were indeed responsible and because Jesus was indeed tortured."

This movie is awful, but then again, I'm not brain dead or a a teenager who is easily wowed by fight moves that they obviously copied off of Power Rangers and a bunch of pretty white kids (That's what MTV and the CW are for and still all crap all the same). It's a blatant hypocrite \"Violence is not the answer.\" Oh please, Mr. Director, get your head out of your ass! And the worst part is it's got he guy from Blood Diamond, really?! What are you thinkin Djimon?!

Sure some parts were cheesy, but when you caught the cheesy parts, the film would let you know it. The parts with fights getting posted on youtube was probably 90% accurate. The other 10% I left out because people never get that popular from fights on youtube. I found the girl in this movie, Baja, was pretty annoying. She was pretty much the \"dummy proof\" part of the story, where she was just there to say the obvious. If they just got a different girl, or didn't make her such a huge part of the movie, this movie is damn decent in my opinion. Djimon Hounsou, playing the trainer in this movie, was obviously really good. Casting couldn't have gone wrong with Djimon Hounsou. He really amped up the feeling in this movie. I couldn't help but notice how much Sean Faris looks like Tom Cruise, and how his acting techniques are pretty much the same. All he had to scream was \"i want the truth!\" Anyways, his acting was pretty good. Nothing special. He could definatley improve, which he most likely will because he is in two other movies this year. The camera angles were really entertaining, and besides the corniness of how it happened, the story arc was very well executed. Despite critical reviews, you can't help but feel amped when a loser becomes a winner. It's been done a hundred times, and this movie worked a different angle at it. It still worked. I came into this movie laughing, and left pretty surprised. I would definatly recommend to other people to watch this movie. I did not tap out half way through this movie."

I feel a strong sense of sadness when I read reviews of films classified by not lovers like that \"useless, barren, arid, money thrown away, but stupid, like so ...\" and so on. The bitterness then turns into sadness when I hear and see film experts, on television, expressing distaste with sarcasm, maybe even embarrassed about putting something on that particular film has to say.\rPersonally, I am convinced that no film, admitted to public viewing, can be scored with the words used by Jake Tyler, \"useless junk, useless junk. I think this an extreme opinion on a film. If I act in this way, throw in a basket that is a film of a film, I threw away, in every sense, the work of many people.

I think this an extreme opinion on a film. If I act in this way, throw in a basket that is a film of a film, I threw away, in every sense, the work of many people. The work, which deserves respect.\r \"Useful\" junk, \". This is a term that I like. In each film there is something good. Extremism, including reviews, I am not convinced.\r The regista. Jeff Wadlow, try looking in a profound way the face of this guy. Incredible. Heard of him and you know why? Why is a person who listens. See also knows those who can listen to a director is crucial. I watch him, always see in him a deep and serenity, is a boy who transmits serenity and confidence. I confess that the two faces, one of Jeff, and indeed that of Jake Tyler (Sean Faris) led me to watching this film. Well, I got in some aspect of the film.\r The guilt.\rFeelings of guilt are terrible whipping, comparable in terms of inner pain, the scourging. Drunken father, Tyler does not replace driving, accident and death of the father. The mother, try to judge the mother, poses and not a little to his son the whole story. When you are aware of the actions committed, good or bad you are and you take all the consequences, show what is called sense of responsibility, maturity. In guilt, however, the mind begins a journey all illogical. Acts, actions, attitudes, no longer have a rational place, we become judges themselves too hard with all its consequences and emotional suffering.\r Wadlow's skill is to show a Tyler, despite all the events, yet master of himself and how? Serious commitment and application in everything he does'. Sport, leaves truce opponent. The school, the shield of Achilles. The brother follows him from afar. It is not an instinctive, see Ryan Mc. Carthy (C. Gigandet, good too).\r And why are so many Tyler and Ryan? Another point in favor of the director Wadlow, parenting behaviors. The smiles of the father of Tyler vs arrogance of the father of Ryan.\r Consequence of this is ... the example by your children. An educator, and every dad is, can leave traces in the boys, who become equal to mine wandering behavior. Beware the examples, dear dad.\r The mother did not help Tyler in, like, metabolize, the death of his father. Consequently, despite all these positive notes, the boy when insulted by the opponent on the field, has a violent reaction, well aware that is a clever thug. And this is worse. How many professional sports, today, paid its weight in gold, with their behavior in inciting violence.\r One last thing, though not like a movie, and this is, is a great gym, we are subject, for budding actors.\r As Homer leaves the narrative of war, to describe the shield of Achilles leads engravings on human nature, even I have to leave, not before I wish you all an affectionate\r Good Ciak!"
