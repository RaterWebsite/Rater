Hitchcock follows the success of Psycho with a film which focuses on how a town can be terrorized by local scavenger birds."

      "text": "This film is gorgeously shot, and its first half is the more interesting half. The ominous presence of the birds and their gradual spark of aggressiveness seems to mirror the developing relationships of the protagonists. Then the big bird attacks start to happen and the movie forgets to have a plot. Mainly worth seeing for the sense of atmosphere and just to be in on the references and knowledge of film history. Definitely feels like a film that could be remade into something way better with a deft writer/director, but it'll likely never happen due to how rabid the fans of the original are about its preciousness to them."

      "text": "As a massive Hitchcock fan, I saw The Birds, and it is a great film, very macabre, suspenseful and terrifying. Those bird fights alone are so well done, that I will admit I have never felt the same about birds again. The cinematography is brilliant, and the direction as you would expect from Hitchcock is superb. The screenplay is well crafted too, especially with \"They're coming, they're coming\".The acting I thought was very good too, particularly from Rod Taylor and Susanne Pleshette, and Jessica Tandy and Tippi Hedren were excellent too. Even Hitch himself makes a \"canine cameo\". The atmosphere is terrific, enough to give you goosebumps. It is true, that there isn't much horror in the first forty minutes, but there is loads of suspense though, and the motive for the bird attacks never were explained. All in all, while not Hitch's best in my opinion, it is still a solid, perplexing and suspenseful horror/thriller, that may leave you terrified of birds. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

      "text": "It plays very well, I could not imagine how some crows could be scary-nobody ever tries a knife on them, strange considering Psycho was Hitchcock's movie before this.   What struck me most is the scandal behind the story about how Hitchcock got obsessed with Tippi Hedren.  Obsession is my greatest fear, much worse than birds or monsters, to be stalked by someone, what do they care so much for about someone who is not interested in them?  Also, I had not realized how much of this movie found it's way into Jaws, the crazy mutilated head early on, the town being a prominent character.  Jessica Tandy was the most interesting person, her fear of abandonment (the most common primal fear) destroying the lives of everyone around her, this was more terrifying to me than the attack of crows, probably because it is so familiar, there are so many people who destroy the lives of those around them just so they will be too crippled to leave.  There is a conversation about it, the schoolteacher says the she was not chased out because of any dislike, but of jealousy, selfishness.  Hitchcock put much of himself into the Jessica Tandy character, probably why she felt so real, and why this movie is so powerful today.  The birds were said to be symbols of nature attacking.  He said the characters in the movie were attacked because they disrespected nature, I imagine Hitchcock felt his passion for Tippi was nature and when rejected, he felt nature was disrespected.  A real master of craft puts himself into his art, an act of pride and humility at the same time.  I think they were symbolic of destruction of human nature.  The first scary attack was at the fireplace, a symbol of romance.  Then the home was torn to pieces,  all well done symbols of destruction caused by obsessive natural jealousy.  I think the lesson is that the only way to deal with crazy people is sneak by quietly and never get their attention, a good scene is when the police are notified, and all they do is blame the victim, the townspeople are the same, they all blame Tippi because the problems arrived when she did.  I am sure there is some truth, Hitchcock was not obsessed until he saw a pretty girl, the logic follows it is the girl's fault when a crazy person gets obsessed.  Once Tippi knew what she was up against, the obstacle becomes staying cool.  All in all, an excellent movie."

      "text": "\"The Birds\" is one of the greatest classics in Alfred Hitchcock's career. Its story basically reports an attack of raging birds against a small village on the Californian coast. The movie has often been touted as overrated but I definitely disagree. It's true that this kind of situation is quite unusual and the reasons for the abnormal behavior of the birds is never properly explained to us. I also considered the way the main character behaves, practically chasing a man she is attracted to without knowing him, is illogical and, at least, strange. That's the biggest negative criticism I can make of this movie which, apart from that, is flawless. The script explores a \"nature vs. human\" situation quite well, doing it in a way that we actually see as threatening, dangerous and tense. The way the birds behave is highly intimidating, and I just hope no animal has been wounded during the shootings. Cinematography is very good as well as visual effects. Tippi Hedren gave life to the main character, Melanie Daniels, a young spoiled daughter of a big-shot, and Rod Taylor played Mitch Brenner, for whom she is romantically interested. Both actors went very well in their characters, counting on the collaboration of a very competent support cast."

Because this was pretty darn disturbing!The Birds finds Hitchcock at his very best building up the tension and creating suspense. The way the minor details are revealed in this movie is enough to make you glued to the screen throughout the whole movie, but I already know that Hitchcock is the best in doing this.What I didn't know before watching this movie is that The Master of Suspense is also a Master of Symbolism!Many people consider The Birds as one of Hitchcock most modest films, even some of his fans. I can see why, and it's simply because the movie seems that it left a lot of very important questions unanswered. I said it seems because it really did answer these questions symbolically.I won't spoil anything for those who haven't seen this gem yet, but I'll just point that the key to all these questions is a very important character and everything related to it.Just try to think which character the movie gave it a lot of exposition, and you'll easily understand the whole movie. And there is where I've an issue with The Birds. I think it gives a lot of explanations to this character that we don't necessarily need to because the movie expose some details what have already been revealed before. That being said, all characters are well-grounded, compelling, interesting, and necessary to the plot.All the performances were excellent, specially from Tippi Hedren who played the movie's protagonist. She is a wonderful actress, and her performance in this movie is nothing short of endearing. She is as charming as Audrey Hepburn!Some few decisions the characters made, may be one or two, are not so subtle, but the execution of the results to these decisions is what annoyed me a little bit. The characters seemed forced to fall into the trap.Although there is some blood and gore in this movie, Alfred Hitchcock proves again that what the scenes imply can be way more brutal than what they show. The scenes when the titular creatures attack are very painful to watch. Adding insult to injury, the birds acquire a metaphorical complexity that is as distressing as their beaks!Overall, The Birds is a very underrated Hitchcock film that doesn't lack any of Hitchcock's unparalleled brilliance. Also it would make a great companion to Hitchcock's most famous work, Psycho!(9/10)"

      "text": "This is a typical Hitchock film in that its pretty tense and suspenseful at times, it keeps you guessing and isn't an all out horror film but perhaps more of a psychological thriller of sorts. I remember reading the story when I was in secondary school, so I had a rough idea of what to expect. The special effects are a bit tame (the bright red blood kept making me think of tomato ketchup - it didn't look like real blood at all I think but I'm maybe a bit of a nitpick?) but of course this is a film of its time, having been released in 1963. I thought it did quite well at making the viewer feel uneasy when faced with groups of birds stood congregating nearby, which is something I doubt anyone would normally bat an eyelid at. I imagine this was really quite a spooky and sinister perhaps even film of its time, although nowadays its hardly what I'd think of as a truly scary film (although one or two images I did find a little frightening) but I can understand why its well regarded and is a cult film. An interesting film by Hitchcock, based on a short story by Daphne DuMaurier, I'd recommend this."

He made movies which were ahead of it's time including this one.The story shown in the movie had a lot of potential but the ending in which there was no reasoning was a let down. Also, the story felt incomplete. They could have made a proper story with 2 hour runtime but they focused too much on story build-up only. The movie was enjoyable. The direction and performances by the actors were good. There is thrill and drama which keeps this movie on track.Overall, it is a good horror thriller drama which will keep you bounded till the end but the climax portion may disappoint you."
