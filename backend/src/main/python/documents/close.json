      "text": "Incredibly poor start to 2019 by Netflix. I haven't hated a movie this much since Dog Days. There's a mountain of plotholes, poor cinematography, horribly non-linear and confusing editing, often abysmal direction, trashy acting and poor writing, including dialogue. I didn't want my first review to be a 0 but it is. Watch Bandersnatch instead or something. How this was an English-language release confounds me. Even the intro is a rip-off of James Bond. The plot is also really bad, and sometimes the editing is so choppy it just jumps time mid-scene."

      "text": "\"Close\" (a Netflix original) is a decent actioner with Noomi Rapace starring as a military operative cum close protection officer for a bratty heiress who's in jeopardy of those closest to her. Yes, there are plausibility issues to be found but they're not egregious. One of the key bits of direction I did appreciate was when the young heiress broke down and cried during hostilities - now, that was a nod to plausibility that you just don't find in many current actioners. However, the denouement was hasty and unsatisfying. Director/writer/producer Vicky Jewson could've and should've done much better with it. This film had the potential to be an \"8\" or \"9\" but instead it performs at a \"6\", maybe \"7\" if you're a Noomi superfan."

Alors, contrairement \u00e0 ce qu'on pourrait croire, ce n'est pas une bessonnerie d'Europa Corp mais \u00e7a pourrait l'\u00eatre sur presque tous les plans... presque, car ce n'est pas aussi mal film\u00e9 que les conneries du gros.En tout cas, tous les poncifs sont r\u00e9unis dans ce film d'action \u00e9cervel\u00e9 au cours duquel Noomi fait la (super) garde du corps pour une petite bourge de blondasse et jeune h\u00e9riti\u00e8re que des malfaisants veulent kidnapper \u00e0 tout prix. On s'ennuie vite, puis on zappe presque aussi vite, car ce navet reste dans l'incapacit\u00e9 de distraire en quoi que ce soit... m\u00eame avec Noomi."
