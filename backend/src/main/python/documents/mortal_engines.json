      "text": "Visually awesome with all kinds of creativity and epic settings that are a blast to watch characters explore but Mortal Engines lacks a lot of soul that other post-apocalyptic films tend to have. This could have been an amazing film if the cast were given better direction and the script was stronger. Because I believe that both of those elements were rushed the film just didn't come off as well as I had expected. Hugo Weaving is a great actor and you could tell that because of the writing and mediocre direction that a lot of quality was left untapped. The movie is entertaining enough but it's constantly fighting its lack of explanation and drumming around a lot of unknown places. Often I found myself wondering why any of the issues in this fictional world matter? Why are certain places important? Why is this major location that gets referenced once or twice so important and what's the beef between some of these rival factions? Because the film gets setup so poorly and there's little effort put into diving into the details I just had a hard time loving this movie, and I really wanted to love it."

Put in order, the story would have benefit from the steady rise in tension and made more sens. The FX are amazing. You won't get bored looking at this movie. The action isn't always great. Sometimes it's very cool, some just plainly generic. The main actors are fine, but all the secondaries are pretty bad. And the dialogues are just poor all the way around especially with the loving part, there is no magic in it (in words). The music is horrible. Doesn't always match what you see on screen. I give it a 62%. It's not a bad film but the only seller are the visuals."

Starting with the positives:\u2022 The movie is a visual treat, as was expected\u2022 The lead actress does an incredible job IMO.  I've never seen her before, but hope to see her again!  Her male co-star does a passable job; no complaints.  In fact, I think the acting was all above average.\u2022 I know some found the story boring, but I liked it, aside from some predictable moments.\u2022 The pacing was spot on.  Gave the movie room to breathe without getting bogged down.The negatives:\u2022 Dumb or overused lines.  Hugo Weaving actually rips a couple lines direct from The Lord of the Rings, which is jarring to hear in another world.  \u2022 Plot holes and non-sensical (or non-existent) character motivations.\u2022 We don't learn enough about the world.\u2022 Terminator in the second act.  Felt like filler.  Plus, we're supposed to feel some emotion at one moment, and I simply didn't.  \u2022 Speaking of emotion, I didn't buy the connection between the two leads.  There simply wasn't enough groundwork laid for it.All in all, definitely worth a watch.  I think the critics have been a little too harsh here (as they usually are for fantasy-like movies)."

It's a Star Wars rip-off, re-wrapped with steam punk and it's done ok with an enormous budget, but offers nothing new, compelling, or interesting. This is a 2-hour long chase scene with 30 minutes of exposition and no character development that makes anyone feel unique or interesting--except Shrike and Anna Fang.

      "text": "The latest contrivance from Peter Jackson, Mortal Engines is a post-apocalyptic action thriller on wheels. The film was penned and produced by Jackson with newcomer Christian Rivers making his feature film directorial debut under Jackson\u2019s wing. The concept of Mortal Engines is set thousands of years ahead of our time. After what was known of the \u201cSixty Minute War\u201d, the Earth\u2019s crust has shattered resulting in a large loss of the earth\u2019s surface area and natural resources. The loss of resources is the main motivating factor behind entire cities transforming their societies into moving war machines. Their only goal; strategizing towards conquering one another for resources. These concepts do not stray far from our own political climate in its current state. The amped up and glamorized special effects make these concepts of moving beasts of cities a fantastic steam-punk fuelled spectacle that gets your gears going. The story of Mortal Engines centres around a young apprenticing historian Tom Natsworthy played by Robert Sheehan. The young aspiring aviator unwillingly becomes involved in the attempted murder of the main monopolizing figure of London and Head of Guild of Historians, Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving). The would-be assassin, Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar), is a masked and mysterious femme fatale figure with some of the new world\u2019s darkest and deepest secrets. After being mostly unsuccessful with her assassination attempt, no thanks to Tom, Hester and Tom find themselves exiled off of London and into the Great Hunting Ground. Left to face the bleak landscape of the new destructed world alone, a world that director Rivers and the set designer Rosie Guthrie decorate with numerous memorable cinematic set pieces, including a southern bayou style encampment vehicle that rolls and crawls through the landscape with clay formations on its back resembling armour similar to something you would see on an ancient dinosaur or armadillo.After being captured and sold as slaves, Hester and Tom are lucky enough to be saved by top world assassin Anna Fang. Korean pop star and actress Jihae plays Fang, pilot and leader of the anti-establishment force known as the \u201canti-tractionists\u201d who oppose the mobilization of cities and subsequent warfare that comes with the capitalist nature of it all. Opposing the idea of what the predator cities adopt as \u201cMunicipal Darwinism\u201d, Fang steals Hester and Tom as well as the slave market scene from the movie commanding attention. Donning a red leather trench coat tat resembles something out of a colourful parallel world Matrix, Fang saves our main protagonists without a hair falling out-of-place from her Presley style pompadour. this among many others scenes in the film are hard to ignore for its blatent yet often times crazy imitation type scenes. Typically, while films with this type of budget and nature, tend to pay great tribute and homage to some of the films it get inspiration film, Mortal Engine tends to spill a little too much grease on its mirroring scenes.In addition to this array of fresh new faces of actors, the supporting cast also includes Leila George D\u2019Onofrio, playing Katherine Valentine, Thaddeus Valentine\u2019s daughter and at least in portions of the film seeming love interest to Tom. Stephen Lang plays the role of Shrike, a Metal Gear Solid styled undead soldier from a battalion called The Stalkers. While Shrike is made mostly of metal and being undead, Shrike and Hester provide the film with the most emotional parts of the film and perhaps the film\u2019s best subplot, Lang and Hilmar give the majority of the film its beating heart, no matter ow cold the subject material really is.While Mortal Engines will be a hard sell in a jam-packed holiday schedule of films, this dystopian future feature film does some provide audiences with amusing portrayals of the future. Both Rivers and Jackson create a world that is both terrifying to imagine, yet fascinating and hard to look away from. Although the film tries a little too hard on being a Mad Max imitation the film is peppered with popular culture references touching on everything from minions, to Apple products (specifically iPhones) and toasters; displayed and spoken about as if they were ancient relics that providing us humans with some essential and crucial nourishment. One of my favourite and probably the most humorous scenes in the film was when we see Esther pull out a Twinkie to eat. Tom makes a remark at how old the Twinkie is and in a cheeky jab towards the food industry, she diffuses his worries by claiming food from the past even if it is a thousand years old in their case of story and time, \u201cnever goes bad\u201d."

      "text": "I can't recommend anyone see this movie. Even ignoring the source material, it is simply bad as a movie. I had high hopes seeing Peter Jackson attached to the movie, but it seems it did not help it outside the general visuals, which is really the only positive thing I can attribute to this movie. The general plot gave the impression they were just trying to rush me along from one pretty action scene to the next, while failing to actually make me care about, or be invested in,  the characters, their motivations, or the world the story takes place in.After going back and reviewing the plot of the book, I found that many of the central themes and events that made it interesting were also glossed over and prettied up in the movie. They managed to take a very interesting character in Shaw and reduce her to a basic pretty girl with generic motivations and personality. With the personalities of the main characters stripped away, the love story they attempt to shoe-in comes across as forced as I am left wondering why these people who just met look like they are already in love."

      "text": "I'm afraid I'm basically mimicking the general opinion on this, but Mortal Engines is more style than substance.Visually this one of those rare visual masterpieces. Director Christian Rivers was a storyboard artist/visual effects guy on the Lord of the Rings/Hobbit films, and he knows how build a world. The film contains a sort of cyberpunk-ish reality that combines the old and new. Everything from the technology to the clothing to even the natural environment feels completely distinctive. The giant tank-like city of London is something to behold. The opening where we're introduced to the place is such a breathtaking scene.The film also has an impressively designed secondary antagonist in the form of the disturbing and relentless Shrike, a cyber-zombie with a piercing voiceBefore I get into the plot, understand that the story and actors are decent, just not strong enough to sustain the 2 hour, 8 minute run time. The script is by Peter Jackson and his regular co-writers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens. Like King Kong and the Hobbit films, they don't realize less is more. Dialogue and some action scenes just go on a little too long. In fairness, the length gives the writers ample time to explain how this busy world works. Even then there are a couple script holes: a character figures out a plot point too quickly without enough plausible context and a supporting character just sort of vanishes once he served his purpose.The film unsuccessfully romantically pairs the two main characters Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) and Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan). It does a wonderful job of building a friendship and why they'd trust each other, but the love aspect is unbelievable. It happens too quickly, and they have no chemistry.Plot-wise the standout character is again Shrike. He has the most sympathetic story-line. In the pantheon of good villains from weak films, I hope Shrike ends up being remembered like the Darkness from Legend and not forgotten like Maximillian from the Black Hole.Despite it's clunkiness, I highly recommend you see this just for this experience. You just may want to watch it at home while your washing the dishes or working on a project."

The action scenes are well edited and keep you engaged. Sadly the movie also attempts a love story, and i can only say those scenes are boring and cringy, definitely the worst parts of the movie are between the two main characters. The world of mortal engines though is interesting enough to keep the movie going, and those talking/flirting scenes dont last too long. Some of the storylines in the movie are better than others, and a few things dont make sense, but i think it is acceptable just because it has its good action, and i was not expecting much more than that. If a sequal comes out i would probably watch it, just because i find the world of mortal engines interesting enough to follow another mediocre story, just to see more interesting locations and vehicles. 6/10 good enough"

Watching the movie for the first time, you feel like there are many layers of depth (moving cities not withstanding), and you are only scratching the surface.  It is occasionally quirky without becoming too excentric to appeal to a mainstream audience.  The visiual style is at times remeniscent of the Lord of the Rings,  though there are moments that seem inspired by Star Wars (in a good way).While there is a message about our use of the planet's resources, the movie is never overbearing, and does not lecture. In short: Mortal Engines is an entertaining movie to watch, with a high level of immersion, and the kind of scenery that  would not have looked out of place in Lord of the Rings."

      "text": "What an under-the-radar treat! And a big THANKS to the random writer who made a list of movies that, \"If You Liked, Alita: Battle Angel...\" Amazing that both of these movies garnered such modest fan-fare. But, my running theory is that Mortal Engines crossed boldly into the political realm. The Governor came off as an obvious symbol of the Dalai Lama. Even the city behind the wall--the statics--was an expanded spitting image of Dharamshala. The Mudusa? One look at that futuristic USB thumbdrive with the \"USA\" imprinted onto it and suspicions are only further assured. London representing the United Kingdom; the kamikaze move by the Asian woman fighting for the good guys; there is certainly an abundance of evidence to further the theory. In any case, if this movie didn't drum-up the PR band this could certainly be a reason why.Okay, onto the review.Another metacritic reviewer had the same thought as myself: That Star Wars vibe. It felt as though I was being drawn into a franchise universe--albeit with a MUCH bigger catalog of set-pieces--sorry Death Star. Should go without saying, the CGI was captivating. To be expected with WETA behind the helm, and Peter Jackson's own dedicated art department manager taking the reins on his first big-budget directing role.Yes, there were some questionable writing decisions made. Lazarus cyborg dying from a scissor kick? The blonde daughter--the protagonist's half-sister--and Tom's friend disappearing from the story for no apparent reason just as they could had stepped-in and stopped the Medusa from wreaking havoc? The villain--a writer with honorary political power--suddenly knew how to wield a sword better than a trained warrior? These were three of the biggest offenders that jerked me abruptly from my immersion.Perhaps the production ran short on funding and had to rush something out the door.But, most importantly, I was largely more-so-than-not, immersed.Eight stars, because Mortal Engines took a well-known plot and turned it into an original cinematic experience that deserves a Twinkies' lifetime of praise."

Mortal Engines is a little bit like Star Wars in that it creates an entire (steampunk) world from scratch and introduces us to a whole bunch of new, nuanced characters whom we are unfamiliar with, all of them with some backstory, which makes things interesting. It's a whole new world. What I really like about the world of Mortal Engines is that it is unlike any other worlds I've seen before in the movies, so the mechanics of the world is totally different. It's a semi-post apocalyptic world, with a hint of dystopia (yet not dark like many of the modern boring dystopian movies we see today) coupled with a dash of hope and humanity. On the one hand you have the humans which, true to life, want to destroy each other and then on the other hand you have the unquenchability of the human spirit found in steampunk itself told through what is likely the coolest steampunk character I've seen in the movies, Shrike (I won't spoil it for you, but you'll know what I mean when you see the movie).With Weta's involvement and Peter Jackson & co, it is no surprise how real they managed to create this steampunk world, in excellent CGI glory. London on wheels is simply so cool and intimidating. The actors all fit into this world well. I reckon they could make this movie even more interesting by fleshing out the characters quite a bit more. All in all, it is simply such a cool movie. Personally, this is one of the most unexpected movies I've seen in 2018 and it is a pleasant surprise, being so different from the other movies. I love it, my kids loved it too. Highly recommended."

      "text": "Like Fantastic Beasts 2:  Gindelwald, here is another movie with AAA budget, direction, acting, effects and CONVICTION in each department.  Both are AAA works of craft in feature film making.  What did the USA critics think?  They could not find a reason to take either film seriously and celebrate all the things working so well.    Both movies made multiple times more in foreign markets than in the USA.  More serious fantasy film makers than David Yates and Peter Jackson almost don't exist.   How their latest works of pop art are being denigrated makes me wonder more about what USA critics want in their movies.  Is it that both films fall short of perfection and therefore should be given low ratings?  Is it how neither marketing campaign caught on and became click-bait ($$$ for social media corporations) with billions of Facebook likes to celebrate?  I'm thinking more how serious fantasy film making is now only taken seriously outside Trump's USA.  Unless--the film has billions of likes and corporations can make money off social media around ads, features and trailers for the film.  You may agree with me much weaker films with marketing campaigns which went more viral, often seem to get higher scores; and therefore, attendance."

In just 2 hours they have managed to recreate a new fantastic world, surprisingly detailed. I strongly recommend this movie to all those who love adventure movies and fairytales."

      "text": "Adapted from the book series, this bleak future is dominated by enormous, elaborate \"traction cities.\" In this case, the travelling London is a steampunk assemblage of landmarks that tramples thru Europe \"eating\" smaller machine municipalities. It's up to a young couple to save the peaceful static towns from this giant predator. If you can get past the unlikely, unrealistic concept, you'll be left with a traditional post-apocalyptic plot. The action is plentiful, but not special. Given that it was shot and produced by folks in New Zealand (known for their excellent visual effects), you can expect everything to look convincingly real. The filmmaking is sufficiently absorbing, but never exciting or original."

Characters are one dimensional, effects are below average and the whole thing is just boring. Sometimes London looks like the beast its supposed to be, but most of the sometimes it just looks like cgi gone bad. The final 30 minutes is a steampunk version of Star Wars - A new hope.I expected a lot more..."

      "text": "Started off really well, with some incredibly interesting concepts and a rich back story, and slowly descended into utter anarchy with no discernable logic and events and action, and dialogue that make literally zero sense. There are moments where I felt like I was missing a massive amount of hidden story, there were characters who look at each other or say a line and I feel like there is supposed to be some relationship between them and I'm supposed to know about it. characters make decisions for seemingly no sensible reason, like for example dropping the young girl off in the garden and then flying straight to the weapon that the young girl needed to get to..??? . this asian dissident girl seems to be a big deal and has some heroic death and I have no idea why or who she really is. I really got the sense this must be adapted from some Manga, or a TV series or a really long novel, but the thing is... if you're going to adapt from a larger source material you really need to edit the story so it actually makes sense in a 2 hour film. They did not do a good job with this as it is just a confused mess of garbage.  If you can't include a character's backstory in the film, they should not be in the film making a 'meaningful look' before they crash their ship into the big city on wheels. I don't know who that is, and it just makes me feel like I'm not welcome at your party. Awful film that just made me angry."
