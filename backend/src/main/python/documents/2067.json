I've seen wors from movies they these so call critics cive high scores in.. the plot and twist were well done. It was slow at times but in all it was good.. DO NOT listen to critics they don't know what is good if it bit them on the back side...97% of the time movies they say are good turn o I t to be garbage and the ones they say are bad are really good.."

      "text": "Not a great film but not the worst either.Kodi Smit-McPhee is hard to look at physically, there is something approaching uncanny valley about his facial structure; perhaps it\u2019s the wide-set eyes and androgynous appearance. Aside, his acting is inconsistently believable, but it\u2019s always nice to see a rock solid Ryan Kwanten even if it\u2019s in a supporting role, and Ryan provides some viewer relief along the ride.The plot, whilst enticing as a concept, feels pedestrian at times, and makes \u201cgetting to the end\u201d feel like a chore. There are redeeming qualities; the sets are cool and overall production effort is reassuring, and the ambition is commendable. If you\u2019re fan of science fiction, particularly time travel and dystopias, this is worth a try, but keep your expectations low."

      "text": "Most of today's SciFi is dull beyond belief. This was different. Sure, the time-travel to save the world thing has been done many times before, but this was woven around a fairly compelling personal story, some wild exaggerations of human impact on the planet and a mixture of good and bad acting (along with some terrible science!). All in all it seemed like a very good local stage drama, flaws, drama and all. The ending was a decent one too. Maybe what I enjoyed most of all was an honest attempt to tell a good SciFi story without the preachy PC whining that's embedded a lot of new content by default. A solid 9 for creativity and focus on entertainment."

      "text": "Too big of a budget to say B-movie, cast and plot is also way above that level. Exactly what you would expect if you like 2012 and the day after tomorrow. And of course, the critics will try to suppress anything with a kernel of truth and less focused on pushing political agendas and identity politics. No wonder they call the plot ridiculous because there's actually lots of scientific facts in it although conclusions vary and naturally there has to be artistic freedom, the critics are allergic to certain less known controversial facts naturally, but it makes for an all the more interesting plot."
