      "text": "Mental health and suicide. Themes already deeply rooted in films and YA novels that demonstrate a clear problem that has always existed but now seems to be more exposed.All the Bright Places plays in a problematic line and it's that like its show 13 Reasons Why, once again Netflix seems to romanticize suicide and the terrible ambiguity of the characters and their personalities, barely get the necessary coherence to deal with their issue in a good way when it decides to lose itself in the clich\u00e9s of youth romance.Besides that I must say the ending feels incredibly forced in what feels like a desperate attempt to provoke a manipulated emotional blow for the audience.That's the most serious problem of this film regardless of its merits and is that it doesn't give the necessary seriousness to its themes and prefers to easily satisfy its youth audience instead of making them question those realities.Netflix is \u200b\u200balready too focused on YA productions and these are evidently succeeding but that shows how little those audiences are demanding in terms of stories and how little interested Netflix is in producing more adult content."

      "text": "It does not earn the places it goes because it does not develop its characters, especially when it comes to Finch. Its love story is a poor, chemistry-less imitation of better love stories, serving no end purpose other than to romanticise and trivialize mental health"

      "rating": "6",
      "text": "This isn't really my preference of film, but I was fairly generous with my review because I thought the terrific acting was worth a mention. Very convincing work by both Elle Fanning and Justice Smith. This story also hits kinda close to home for me as well, as I am someone who has suffered from Manic Depression and Bipolar Disorder for most of my life. I've also loved and lost somebody who suffered from the same fate, so I found this picture quite relatable!"

      "text": "Beautiful, but bittersweet. I tend to find Netflix dramas overly melodramatic and lazily made, but this was a pleasant surprise. Great showcase of Elle Fanning and a star making performance for Justice Smith. Hope this is the new standard for Netflix originals."
