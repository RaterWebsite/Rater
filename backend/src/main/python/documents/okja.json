Behind the simple story of a little girl and her pig, there is a really complex movie with colorful, interesting, flawed and yet very relatable characters.When you see the relationship between Okja and the little girl, other movies like Totoro and Pete's Dragon will come to mind, it's the old tale of the friendship between the animal/mystical creature and a kid. Full of innocence, beauty, and wonder. But the twist here is that this animal is being bred to be eaten.I'm not a vegan, and I am still not a vegan after watching this movie. But reducing this movie to \"eating meat is murder\" would be completely stupid and plain wrong, I would remind people that we see the the girl eating fish and a grand father making chicken stew.Okja is not a real animal, it's an imaginary creature made of CGIs. This is not a documentary about cows going to the slaughterhouse.But this \"Super-pig\" that is Okja, is the catalyst for a lot of questions that we have today about our food. The movie is more about making people think about what is in our plates, how it got there, and where do you draw the line between an intelligent animal like a dog and a animal that is just food like a fish. About the tone of the movie, it successfully shows a harsh reality, but under the light of an excentric imagination. It's a movie where you laugh, cry, hate and think.And to me, it is all the marks of a great movie. I would add that some scenes are really not suitable for children though. This is more PG-13."

      "text": "The fight against the nature and its commercialisation might as well be a shallow faux pas forward pass, the drama once again, saves the day.OkjaJoon-ho Bong merrily deconstructs the fame of Disney by exploring their own territory, without all the mushy-gushy romance. The result is surprisingly and equally challenging. Usually, when you are diving into a fantasy as such, the product comes out pure only when there is an unflinching promise delivered to every frame, character and element of that storytelling piece. But this project is standing against those theories. And not just for it repetitively grounds the rules with pragmatic structure of the \"fire caught in the forest\" property that an internet comes of. But also the unexplainable and yet vital change in genres that the films conjures.This sojourning structure that builds itself up unfortunately strips away the film into tiny snippets, little clips that never ever condones the previous or the latter format that it is bridged with. This alienated way of telling an emotionally driven story could have been only captured to its true essence by an experienced filmmaker as him. That is of course, not to say that he succeeds every time, all the way. But as mentioned it a testament of his skills to pull off an almost impossible heist that has multiple character played by multiple stars as them.It makes sense now that Jake Gyllenhaal would stay behind the action. The real action already had too much traffic both characters and plot wise. And which also explains why his presence, when entered, in the room, then will be a staggering bolt of thunder, not enlightening but delighting us and destroying the film's ethical morales. Okja maybe, tries too hard to not be that cliched Beauty And The Beast type of film, it may succeed but it undeniably is an effortful adventure, campaign, mission and expression of love- not between the lead character but the shady political deals."

Swinton and Seo-Hyun Ahn are strong, but the rest of the cast is either ridiculously out of place (Gyllenhaal) or given little to nothing to do (Collins, Espacito, Yeun, Bostick). Despite once again creating a film that has strong production value and is beautiful visually, much of Joon-Ho's film is over the top, which takes away from the still somewhat effective and emotional message and commentary that the film was trying to portray."

I felt it was more anti-corporation (yes, that old chestnut again), which has been done to death and really is a waste of celluloid time. It's like being anti-sunshine, or declaring a war on terror \u2013 soundbite nonsense that has no hope of success. What I didn\u2019t like about the film was the acting. The young girl was awkward and seemed ill at ease in front of the camera. Jake Gyllenhaal was just terrible and Tilda Swinton wasn\u2019t much better -  they gave ham-fisted (pun intended) performances that were embarrassing to behold. Having said all that, I liked the big pig thing. He/she/it was cute, in a way that a hippo crossed with a dog would be cute. And who wouldn\u2019t want an animal that craps on demand."

Even though it is announced as the first vegetarian action film ever, it has a number of other political topics to offer such as the role of corporations and police officers in society, questioning today's state structure in general. That being said, I have to acknowledge the animal rights part as well and point out that it is surprisingly well thought out. Also, the emotion it brings is really inspiring.

Besides, kids are actually smarter than this clumsy polemic. It is (unfortunately) consistent with the director's other films - from Memories of Murder to Snowchaser - although the pervasive flaws seem much more blatant here. The first act is sweet and beautifully composed but when the second act takes the plot downhill (literally), the movie goes with it. The actors (particularly Swinton and Gyllenhall) mug gratingly, infuriatingly throughout. Every semblance of nuance disappears. The bad capitalists are really, really bad. The good animals are really, really good. The dumb comic foils are really, really dumb. Just like this movie. May be the last Bong movie I bother to watch."

I'm happy to say that there's definitely a very imaginative and moving story to be told in this film. Sure it may be like several other films in the past in which a child befriends a large creature or thing and has to try and protect it from the government, military, etc., but the performances from the cast consisting of an always reliable Tilda Swinton (taking on dual roles in this one), Paul Dano, Lily Collins, Jake Gyllenhaal, etc., as well as its unique and lively imagination, spirit, and effects really make it worth checking out. Overall, definitely one of Netflix's better and worthwhile films in recent memory."

It will open new doors!\" I find this to be especially patronizing given the situation Mija is in (she doesn't know what is going on because of course, she doesn't speak good English at this point and is deceived by the ALF group).

      "text": "As the movie opened, I took in the surreal mood of the film, hoping for an enjoyable two-hour adventure, but then, at opening minute number five, the mood was instantly demolished with the utterance of the \"mother-of-all-curse-words\", such utterance having no place in what could have been a \"full-family-viewing\" event.  As anyone who consumes animal flesh must undeniably understand, the processing of live animals into edible proteins, fats and minerals is an intensely invasive process which begins with the taking of the life of an animal in order to create a food-stream to support the nutritional needs and to prolong the existence of other carnivorous and omnivorous animals.  While there are limitless alternative non-animal-based food-streams which provide identical or superior nutrition, food choices are based upon availability and individual or group preferences.  The overstated theme of this film was to supposedly provide an affordable and efficient long-term supply of single-breed animal-based food products to feed the populations of starving people worldwide.  While the conflicts which ensued from kidnapping the Super-Pig were easily anticipated, the frenetic, nearly non-stop action and dialog was enjoyable, with the exception of the continuing objectionable language.  The win-lose, lose-win, win again, lose again struggles by the apparent heroine and the clumsy ALF were sufficient to comedically illustrate the extremes by which individuals and groups must drive themselves in order to quash their apparent nemesis; a good lesson to be learned by the youngsters, were it not for the cursing.  As the drama continued and the finale lingered just beyond the not-too-far-off horizon, the terminus was unsurprising, but as a \"full-family-viewing\" event (no bad language), it would have had far greater appeal with viewing youngsters dizzily running about the viewing room and jumping for joy, thankful that at least one such animal, out of the countless millions slaughtered and consumed, would spend an eternity in peace, friendship and life everlasting with her \"foster parent\"."

The tone oscillates wildly, the creature design is great but poorly rendered, it's too long, and for god's sake don't show this to children. There were some delightful moments in the first act, but the jarring script quickly shatters the illusion that this might be a whimsical cinematic journey. I don't know who this is for, and it feels like a sadly lost opportunity as the reliance on one dimensional caricature and a complete lack of subtlety utterly undercut what could have been an interesting and unique film. The phenomenal cast are done a disservice by the incongruence of the tone and message; Scooby-dooesque hijinks and childlike moments are interlaced with brutal cruelty and violence, but rather than providing a counterpoint or foil, this undermines what should have been an important and powerful message as the film becomes a poor parody rather than the commentary it seeks to be. 4.57/10."

But it is good fun.The movie wants you to care about all the pigs but really it's just Okja that matters. Not to mention it seems to chicken out after it begins to give a conscience to the food factory. As great as saving beautiful animals is, the whole idea behind these pigs is to eliminate world hunger, so like, what does the movie have to say about that moral conundrum? Eh, not much.

In the first half of the movie you have delightful absurdist Wes Anderson-esque comedy that introduces the main character and the adorable Okja well. The second half of the film (namely once they get to America) seems falls flat for me however. While the film as a whole attempts to satirize (mostly) industry and (to a part) animal-rights activists it doesn't do either in an effective enough way. It's unclear if the Lucy character (one of the corporate characters played by Swinton) is actually genuine or not. If she is it's a good even-sided view of industry if not the portrayal of industry in this film amounts to a (albeit very amusing) smear of corporate practices and more importantly (or disappointingly) of scientists. The ALF (animal liberation force) is equally confusingly portrayed. In some ways the film clearly wants to poke fun to the organization with things like the member that refuses to eat due to his carbon footprint. Yet in other ways it makes them out to be these pure heros despite the fact that Dano's character beats on of the other ALF members at one point in the film. While the film is amusing and cute neither the ALF or industry is satired in a fair or clear way. This is unfortunate because the message about corporate farms is a good one by unfortunately it got somewhat muddled by the film's inability to take a side and also its inability to bring either side fully to light."

The cast is fantastic with artists like Steven Yeun (Walking Dead), Paul Dano (12 years a slave), Giancarlo Esposito (Breaking Bad), Tilda Swinton (The Hunger Games) and of course Seo-Hyeon Ahn who takes the leading role. Despite her age, I feel she was pretty amazing in transmitting that feeling of anarchy and carelessness for the new world.Okja is a mix of a family movie, social critic documentary and cult drama, so if you're into those three, definitely a catch.

When the Corporation shows up to take the animal back and take it to New York, where it will be crowned the winner of a television contest and then sent to the slaughterhouse together to be marketed on a very large scale, Mija is not there and starts in the pursuit of her best friend, encountering Mirando's intricate marketing plans but also a group of animal rights activists eager to denounce their abuses.This superficial fable directed by bong jon ho proposes a work of animal rights / environmentalist denunciation but ends up hiding a real emptiness."

The story is fantastic, the cast, ranges from Koreans like Ahn Seo-hyun, Choi Woo-shik, Yoon Je-moon to many Hollywood talents like Tilda Swinton, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Lily Collins, Steven Yeun and Giancarlo Esposito,... are super amazing. Totally worth watching."
