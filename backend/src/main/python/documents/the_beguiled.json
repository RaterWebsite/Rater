Oh yes the plantation, the inside and outside, which is the set of the movie, also rises above the material.Coppola, directing and writing, remade the movie, originally directed by Don Siegel and starring Clint Eastwood and Geraldine Page, eliminating a very interesting aspect from the original, and leaves many questions as to why and what did she think she was bringing to the film? We have seen Southern women and girls in peril during the civil war before in many movies and she brings nothing new to that angle and her two most forceful scenes will have the audience turning their head away and/or closing their eyes.I found \u201cThe Beguiled\u201d to be a slow, quite boring movie."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "I saw The Beguiled on BluRay.

As much as I like Sofia Coppola's other films (and I really wanted to like this one), this film was a turkey. The entire film takes place in a large southern mansion and most of the film is shot in two rooms -- the bedroom where Colin Farrel is bedridden and the living room. The first 80 minutes is very slow character buildup centered around Kidman, Dunst and Farrell. The film picks up a little and then drifts back down to a mellow conclusion. The lack of a discernible soundtrack adds to the slowness.

Can they trust him or can he trust them? Right away I was expecting a tense and suspenseful gothic drama instead I got bland, non-engaging and lots of running around the house with flowy nightgowns and candles.

Updating the Clint Eastwood vehicle (of which I saw once about 15 years ago), Coppola moves the focus from the injured Union soldier (Colin Farrell) to the Southern women left a decaying school who take care of him.  She and DP Philippe LeSourde build a strong sense of atmosphere through shots that feel both claustrophobic and voyeuristic. Many shots are framed through windows, doorways, gates, or with the help of the ancient oak trees that line the South with their looming, oppressing branches and are filled with smoke and visible rays of sunlight. It almost feels like a haunting. By keeping the camera back from the actors, close-ups are rarely used if at all, they create an impressive mise-en-scene that highlights not only the mounting tension but the impressive production and costume designs (perhaps some nominations come the end of the year). Add a minimal score, replaced instead by the constant nature noises of the rural South (I miss the sounds of cicadas in the marshes of my South Carolina days) and the occasional distant cannon blasts, and natural lighting and atmosphere is solidified. This is all in tone with the performances by Nicole Kidman, Kirsten Dunst, Elle Fanning, the aforementioned Colin Farrell, and the other girls at the Seminary are all beautifully understated.  The tension and pacing both grow as the film moves along until it nail-bitingly comes to where it must. It\u2019s haunting and fully recommended.

I was wrong.    For a movie called \"The Beguiled\", there is nothing particularly beguiling about it.    Colin Farrell plays a wounded Union soldier taken in by the home to heal from his wounds, and the movie drags along to the half way point with no real action, suspense, and very little moving plot.    Only after that point does it begin to show promise, and despite some great possibilities for a truly frightening movie, it falls flat.    We never get past the prissy performance by Nicole Kidman, who shows about as much depth as a kiddie pool.    What is supposed to pass for real sexual frustration and tension barely scratches the surface, and even when Farrell starts getting \"creepy\", unconvincingly at that, the movie just doesn't connect.    We get a lot of praise for Sofia Coppola, but I don't see the greatness that she supposedly possesses.    This is a movie long on expectation, boring in its delivery, and left my wife and I wondering just what the fuss was all about.

It is subtle and requires attention, but if you can give the film that, the experience is very rewarding. I guess you\u2019d have to say it is a typical Sofia Coppola film such as Lost in Translation and The Bling Ring. Another problem is the misleading trailer. What happens to the wounded soldier at the hands of Nicole Kidman is not as sensational as the trailer implies and has nothing directly to do with castration. Within the immediate events of the film, it makes perfect sense, although what is going on underneath is another matter. The cast is wonderful, especially Colin Farrell, Kidman, and Kirsten Dunst.

On the one hand, it could have been an interesting take on the original. That version was a bit campy and overheated, its emotions and intentions written all over each scene. What if those were scaled back and we were left with simmering emotions and gentle backstabbing and mysterious intentions? A story that captures the politeness of the south and the demureness of the times but with this unmistakable sexual tension underlying everything. It could work.But it doesn't, not really. Characters feel half-realized, somehow holding back their emotions results in ciphers whose actions seem to take on even more of a plot-forward agency than before. Specific actions happen seemingly at random, rather than being the result of a perfectly cooked setup that boils over. It's all a bit too laconic and Coppola doesn't find a way (like she has in her other films) to make the undercurrents the main current, the repressions the inevitable explosions. It just feels empty.

Most like \"Lost in Translation\", I personally was most deeply touched by \u201eSomewhere\u201c. (I know, such a surprising choice.)But it surely is one of her most crowdpleasing films. Just think of the story and possibilities coming with it. US Civil War, Southern girls\u2019 boarding school. Sheltered young women take in an injured enemy soldier. As they tend to his wounds, the household is fast taken over with sexual tension and rivalries\u2026 And all this in rich southern gothic like sauce.Written and directed by Sofia Coppola, \u201eThe Beguiled\u201c is based on Thomas Cullinan novel which has already been brought to screen in 1971, with Clint Eastwood as the male lead. This time, it\u2019s Colin Farrell vs Nicole Kidman, Kirsten Dunst, Elle Fanning and the others. What could go wrong?Well\u2026 it is not bad. It\u2019s just too short and underdeveloped to be really really good \u2013 you know, Cannes winning director worthy. While I really appreciate films being less than two hours for a change, there\u2019s really too much exciting content here to be contained in only 93 minutes.Thus, the third and final chapter of the story is noticeably weaker than what comes before that. One shouldn\u2019t save time on building atmosphere, characters and relationships when all these are essential to the story.To Coppola\u2019s credit, she\u2019s still a fine director. By which I mean she\u2019s good technical director: everything feels well composed and thoughtful.The movie as a whole also feels somewhat less emotionally distanced and dry than her usual, because she\u2019s playing with different genres and manages to offer delicious mix of southern gothic, drama, subtle black comedy, erotic thriller, even horror. And, of course, you can\u2019t have \"dry and distanced\" in the middle of this lush southern setting.All this is supported by able cast consisting mostly of women, Farrell in the middle of it all is not the most important player.It\u2019s much more intriguing to watch all the women circling around him, nobody usually in the forefront, but almost everybody out there to stake a claim. The acting is mostly about nuances and subtlety, so there\u2019s a lot of enjoyment to be had from just watching and witnessing.I am especially happy for Nicole Kidman doing another good role in a good movie recently (after \u201eLion\u201c). She\u2019s appeared in so many forgetful and mediocre projects in this century that it\u2019s hard to get excited about her appearing somewhere anymore.The bigger parts also go to Dunst and Fanning, who are playing to their usual strengths, one shy but heartful, the other one kind of dangerous and lustful. All this works, and works well.In a way, Sofia Coppola\u2019s movies are like Jim Jarmusch\u2019s. if you can\u2019t invest yourself in her slow moving stories mostly interested in mood rather action or being easily digestible, you can feel bored or underwhelmed soon.As mentioned above, \u201eThe Beguiled\u201c is somewhat more welcoming than her usual. But as a whole, it feels also uncomplete, or less complete than usual.But I'm, of course, still happy about having seen it, and Coppola continuing to make movies."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Watch The Beguiled Full Movie - Online Free [ HD ] Streaming http://qn.telemovie.pw/movie/399019/the-beguiled.htmlThe Beguiled () - Colin Farrell American Zoetrope Movie HDGenre : Drama, WesternStars : Colin Farrell, Nicole Kidman, Kirsten Dunst, Elle Fanning, Angourie Rice, Oona LaurenceRelease : 2017-06-23Runtime : 91 min.Movie Synopsis :During the Civil War, at a Southern girls\u2019 boarding school, young women take in an injured enemy soldier.

The movie plodded along until it mercifully ended.  There were a few moments of high dramatic tension; but, because there really were no characters in the movie about whom I cared enough to be concerned about what might happen to them, even those moments fell flat.

Coppola's world in here is brimmed with all the negative emotions i.e. from jealousy to betrayal, and this factors in majorly on latter stages, when an innocently brewd poignancy barges in amidst all the hatred and elevates the tale into a whole new level. Addition to that, the subjective procedure that it follows isn't rudimentary but fresh with a newer structure and with unseen stakes that communicates to a point where the audience wishes to move the puzzles but in the end is inevitable. And this is where Coppola's experience paint in those bright colors that fiddles with viewers' emotions. The credit goes to stellar performances too, that helps express these concept on screen. The background score barely factors in but cinematography and editing is decent enough to make it work. The adaptation is gripping and smart that consumes each characters' perspective in, within 90 minutes of runtime. Farrell's character stands out alone and so does his performance along with Kidman's edgy and darker portrayal whilst Dunst's a bit mellower one. The primary reason why it is scary at times is that it barely offers in any outside help to the characters, the bubble gets evil as much as smaller it gets. Draining down all the possibilities takes most of the time on the screen, in order to reach into a non-feasible narrower last act which is disappointing as much as pathos it is. The emotions iterated in each characters and early humorous acts and gripping tight screenplay are the high points of the feature.

The entire film is setting up a rather specific scenario with the soldier. A decision that he will make that will shape the rest of the film, and honestly, when the time came it was a bit anti-climatic and from there on it was rather obvious the path the story would go down.

For a long time it feels like the story is going nowhere, until it takes a turn in the last thirty minutes, and even then it starts to drag.There's also one moment towards the end where one of the characters implies something, and I thought it was pretty smart how they managed to get the idea across in just one line of dialogue, but then the characters just proceed to explain very unambiguously what they're talking about, which was very disappointing.Still, the film is very well made and it definitley has a lot more going for it than againts it, it's just a shame that none of it will really stay with me."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I found this film to be quite atmospheric and I was intrigued to find out more about the wounded soldier who is taken in (Corporal McBurney, played by Colin Farrell). The film is almost entirely in very dark settings, so its best to watch it with curtains closed, or you may struggle to see all of whats going on, on screen but I thought the script was good and it somehow made it feel more mysterious and atmospheric overall.I liked how the teacher, Miss Martha (played by Nicole Kidman) reacted/responded to the new found occupant of the house, the way she used the situation to make her students reflect on what they may have learnt from the situation and so on. I suppose its partly about trust - trust and secrets. Its an intriguing and atmospheric watch - one that I'd recommend to others."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Wow, this movie was terrible. The trailer itself spoiled LITERALLY EVERY plot point. Such a boring story where nothing interesting ever happens."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Okay.The trademark Sofia Coppola production values are there, but some of acting is a letdown as is the story at times."}], "recommendations": ["allied", "the_good_shepherd", "you_were_never_really_here", "a_most_violent_year", "the_rover", "bad_times_at_the_el_royale", "sicario_day_of_the_soldado", "prisoners", "reminiscence", "widows", "the_woman_in_the_window", "beirut", "hugo", "thoroughbreds", "nocturnal_animals", "the_machinist", "the_american", "good_time", "a_history_of_violence", "the_place_beyond_the_pines", "wind_river", "no_country_for_old_men", "the_killing_of_a_sacred_deer", "127_hours", "the_light_between_oceans"]}
