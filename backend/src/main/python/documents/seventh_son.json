I have seen school performances that were more memorable than this.It felt like three first-time scriptwriters came together on a rainy weekend - with a goal to include as many genre cliches as possible per minute.I never thought the day would come where I say this: Van Helsing (2004) was the better movie.That anyone would film this script can only be explained if the investors desperately needed a guaranteed write-off project."

It had a script of a film that I had seen a hundred times and it\u2019s been done better before and it wasted a brilliant ensemble cast.  How you have a film with Julianne Moore and Jeff Bridges in and you don\u2019t get a decent performance, I will never understand, and it is a sign of poor directing.  The 3D was laughable and I think actually impeded the film I was watching and the action sequences were really varied in quality.  It\u2019s a very bland, very forgettable film and if I haven\u2019t forgotten about most of it in a week, I will be amazed!!  I won\u2019t be surprised if this film turns up in my worst films of 2015 list, although it is way too early to speculate on that. The ending of the film eludes to this becoming a franchise PLEASE NO!"

      "text": "Fantasy adventure films have always had their place amongst the realm of cinema, when I was young I loved fantasy adventure, films like: Conan, Krull, Beast Master and alike. These days though I feel as though everything that gets released in the genre are recreations of plots done to death and were done much better, sure the special effects in the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s were nothing compared to what they are today but that\u2019s what made those films so great, those little special effects. These days CGI is king and a lot of the time is so over used that it leaves nothing for our imaginations to grasp hold of.\rSeventh Son is the story of Gregory the spook (one who hunts the supernatural) and his mission to destroy the Queen of the witches Mother Malkin set in the 18 century. After trapping Malkin years pass by and she remains in prison until the threat of a new blood moon looms, Malkin escapes her prison and takes off to cause havoc and reclaim her kingdom once more. Gregory and his newest apprentice Ben; the seventh son of a seventh son set about the task of stopping Malkin and protecting the world from the devastation she plans to bring\u2026\rSound familiar???\rIt\u2019s a story that has been told time and time again, set in all ages and in all places but especially medieval times where this is set once again. The stand out for the film and the reason you should see it though is for Jeff Bridges (The Big Lebowski, True Grit) who plays Mater Gregory, he has created a fantastic character in Gregory, everything from his voice to his movements is exciting to hear and see. Also helping the film out is Julianne Moore (Still Alice, Mockingjay pt 1) who plays Mother Malkin, she manages to bring an over the top possibility down to Earth and even a little humble, she has done a marvelous job with her character and even though she is the \u201cbad guy\u201d you can\u2019t help but root for her in some places, and that\u2019s about all the goodness the film has to offer. The other characters are annoying, the actors should be on an Australian soap opera, they were lifeless, plain and boring, they brought nothing to the screen but a presence, and I hate to say it; but I doubt if the actors were even replaced with A list celebrities their characters would have been any different. I feel all the effort was put into Jeff and Julianne and the CGI landscape and beasties. Ben Barnes (Chronicles of Narnia, Stardust) plays the son of the seventh son Tom Ward, Alicia Vikander (Anna Karenina, A Royal Affair) plays Alice, Olivia Williams (The Sixth Scent, Rushmore) plays Mam who does bring a little something more to her character at least.\rThis is Sergey Bodrov\u2019s first real English film he is really well known for his Russian films so I did expect a lot more from him, I have a feeling that perhaps the actors may have directed themselves in places as he sat back and took it all in. I was disappointed as I definitely expected more from the director of \u201cMongol\u201d and \u201cNomad\u201d. The CGI used was so extensive at times there was so much happening on the screen it was hard to make heads or tails of what was taking place, don\u2019t get me wrong it was great, the dragon scenes in particular were legendary it was just a little messy is all. It seems to be CGI has taken over a lot of the substance a film can deliver when cheap thrills and special effects are used.\rSeventh Son isn\u2019t worth rushing out to see, it is worth waiting to see on dvd at least but I wouldn\u2019t be wasting my money at the cinemas. Being a fantasy adventure its appropriate for kids with only a few swears nothing they wouldn\u2019t hear in the school yard on a daily basis anyway."

How many times have we seen that before? It\u2019s just so dumb, anything you can predict that is going to happen based on previous similar films, happens; there\u2019s no one single unexpected twist, and there\u2019s absolutely nothing new. The script is very laughable at. They don\u2019t even bother in explaining why the main character is so special. The only reason they give to us is because he is the seventh son of a seventh son (and another stupid reason that I don\u2019t want to spoil), and that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t even know what Jeff Bridges, Julianne Moore and Djimon Hounsou were doing there, but it\u2019s definitively bad for their curriculum.\rUntil now, one of the worst movies of 2015. The only thing I can rescue from it is a very occasional sense of humor, and some cool action scenes (some were cool, another were really stupid). Nevertheless, don\u2019t even bother watching this film, it\u2019s a waste of time and money.\rReal score: 3.5"

All of us liked it very much, including the daughter who read the book.  In fact, she said it was the best movie she's seen in months, much better than the last two, where we made the mistake of trusting the \"professional\" critics, who rated them quite high.  I simply do not understand the bad user ratings, unless there is some attempt to appear sophisticated by aping the critics, who don't review movies with the same approach us average users do.  I make my judgements based on whether the movie justified my admission fees.  This movie did so.  The special effects were, as is so common now, flawless.  The acting was good, and the plotline explained what this user needed to know of the backstory.  I give it a solid 8 out of 10 as a good action adventure romp that provides a good release from the cares and stress of daily life.  I recommend keeping an open mind and giving this one a try.  It's sure better than \"Black Sea,\" which left me wanting to ask for a refund."

Sigh, I know 3 of the characters names, Tusk, Mother Malkin, and Master Gregory. The rest are apparently unimportant. I left the theater with more questions than anything. Where do Gregory go after everything? Why did every witch burn away and showcase bad CG upon death? The movie wasn't all bad but there nothing really good and I laughed about twice. Only the young would find any enjoyment from this, assuming they haven't seen a million other movies with the same plot."

      "text": "I have seen lots of fantasy movies from The Lord of the Rings to Monty Python and the Holy Grail and let me tell you Seventh Son brings on a whole new experience. This movie brings light upon a new set of fantasy. It is about a boy named Tom Ward who is chosen to aid the spook because he is the seventh son of the seventh son and on that journey he must fight creatures sent by the evil witch that wishes to gain all this power from the blood moon. First off people can not go into the movie expecting Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings this is mainly because Seventh Son is its own thing. From I have seen in other reviews they did not understand the story for some reason, but I promise if you have half a brain you would fully understand. The reason I am rating this a 9 is mainly because through out the movie there was this character that I thought annoying but besides that everything was pretty darn awesome. The effects and action scenes were awesome. Also, from what I know it is supposed to be a book series so I will be very excited to see a sequel to this film. I do not know why this movie has been trashed on and I know this one review will not stop that but I promise who ever reads this if you are on actual fan of Fantasy or Action you will enjoy this movie, and I forgot to mention that I saw this movie in IMAX and was completely amazed at how amazing the movie was with the 3D and amazing sound system. So, if you find yourself at the movies and do not really know what to watch I highly suggest this movie, I say watch it in IMAX but if you do not have the money that is completely understandable, I hope my review helps in your final decision to watching the movie."

      "text": "A medieval fantasy film that is about the same quality as a Uwe Boll film. You can tell the actors know that this is nothing more than cheesy schlock as none of them give genuine performances. Jeff Bridges turns up the camp for his performance and Julianne Moore, well, she simply barely gives it any effort. They know the film is low quality and they don't really try as a result. The young actors are just kind of there, and the rest of the cast is completely unremarkable.\r The plot is generic and uninteresting. It follows the same path most movies based off of YA novels take. Our young protagonist is taken under the wing of a veteran character who trains him to be the a hero right as an old enemy resurfaces. It's got the same predictable romance between our two young leads and a painfully predictable twist surrounding the relationship of Moore and Bridges' characters. However this film has the disadvantage of feeling less fleshed out and a lot more rushed in the storytelling department. The romance also falls flat on it's face thanks to the fact that Barnes and Vikander have absolutely no chemistry. As a result the romance just seems to sort of happen. There's no sort of genuine affection between the two characters. They get together just for the sake of the film having a romance.\r The film doesn't even succeed in the action department. Battles are yawn inducing affairs.  They also look clumsily directed. That's really a complaint that can be attributed to the film as a whole. The majority of the scenes just look so goofy thanks to the shoddy work of director Sergei Bodrov. Unlike many, I also found the CGI to be cheap looking. It's a film that tries to get by on big spectacle, but fails to deliver it thanks to untalented writing and design.\r It's a failure in just about every sense. A boring film that feels rushed beyond belief. The only highlight being that there are a few jokes scattered here and there delivered by Bridges that can lead to a chuckle or two. However when the best thing about your movie are some cheesy jokes you've thrown in in order to make the film feel lighter you've pretty much failed.\r I give \"Seventh Son\" a 3.2/10."

His odd choice of accent and drawl was hard to ignore. Moore was also pretty good, but at times was a little too over-the-top. The rest of the cast was completely forgettable and Alicia Vikander (who played the main character's love interest) was outright terrible.
