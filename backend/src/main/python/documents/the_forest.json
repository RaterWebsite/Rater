      "text": "Japan's Aokigahara \"Suicide Forest\" by itself is a creepy and gruesome place because of its reputation as one of the most notorious suicide spots in the world as well as its historic association with demons in Japanese mythology. Its inherently scary atmosphere is perfect for a good horror movie, but The Forest mostly squanders its promise by degrading it to a hot spot for cheap jump scares. The Forest stars Game of Thrones star Natalie Dormer in a dual role as twins Jess and Sara. Jess has disappeared into the forest, and Sara travels to Japan to go into the forest to look for her, unaware of the demons that lurk in the forest. The film has a pretty interesting premise and could have worked if executed correctly. 2014's As Above, So Below took an intrinsically creepy setting, the Paris catacombs, and used an unsettling atmosphere and good scares to make one of the better horror films of that year. The Forest does not use its setting to its advantage. Any atmosphere created by the forest is frittered away by a dull jump scare. Despite all the loud noises and sudden shocks, the scares are just boring. That could have been helped by a good story, but once Sara actually reaches the forest, the plot just sort of stops. The last half of the movie is just her running through the forest while demons pop out from behind the trees. It's not until the end that the plot decides to move forward any more, but by the time the big twist happens, you don't really care. The Forest has a committed performance from Natalie Dormer and glimmers of an interesting movie but mostly wastes them on predictable jump scares and a bland story."

      "text": "Hanging on the verge of mediocrity, \"The Forest\" is a resident of old horror spectacle.\r Aokigahara, otherwise known as Suicide Forest, literally writes its own stories. It's a place where people go to end their lives, a real life horror vista which has haunted many documentaries and videos. As creepy as the setting is, The Forest is still trapped on archaic horror gimmicks. It doesn't mean it has no merit, few of its moments are quite delightful, yet it spends most of the time wandering across predictable set-ups and mundane scares.\r Sara (Natalie Dormer) goes to Japan to find her missing twin sister Jess (also Natalie Dormer). The search leads her to Aokigahara, the infamous forest. Unfazed by this revelation, Sara is still determined to search for her, almost stubbornly so. Natalie Dormer of Game of Thrones\u2019 fame is definitely a draw as this is a different genre than her other works. She does put in the effort, her strong motivation persists although the character is stuck on typical scream queen stereotype.\r It's insane how many times her character randomly strolls to dark corners or investigates weird occurrence alone even though ample warnings have been given. These are actions common sense would dictate as unwise, especially on a place called Suicide Forest, yet she performs them blindly anyway. It's pretty over saturated that the excuse of her being in trance because hypnotic forest made her do it is not sufficient anymore.\r There are some good moments that are chilling and well presented, it even occasionally ventures to psychological perspective of the ordeal. However, the movie usually returns to average scares of oriental horror such as vague ominous warning or lost girl in peculiar outfit. It's a rigid showcase of horror, one that's been used since the days of Ju-On and arguably even before that.\r While the draw of exotic location and appealing lead actress might interest visitors, they would only find basic horror in The Forest."

The plot revolves around a young woman called 'Sara' (played by Natalie Dormer) who goes in search of her twin sister 'Jessie' who has recently gone missing in the Japanese forest of 'Aokigahara', otherwise known as Suicide Forest. The film clearly wants to be a psychological thriller, however with it's consistently poor dialog coupled with numerous narrative shortcuts (including a very half baked sub plot concerning the twins parents) the film doesn't reach a level of depth in narrative or (more importantly) character development in order to provide a true sense of psychological intrigue.

I'm not saying this because the kids in front of me checking snapchat, instagram and even mocking the Japanese people talking in the film. I just genuinely hated the movie. Aside from Natalie Dormer's performance and and a few cool scenes. There isn't any point in watching this movie. The acting was annoying especially since the actors don't work well with each other each other at all except for Natalie Dormer and Taylor Kinney. Their back and forth was at least watchable but for everyone else. I just wanted them to die! I was hoping the suicide demons would be like \u201cHey, come over here!\u201d The actions and choices the characters made were unrealistic and clearly only made to keep the movie moving because if these characters were thinking logically the movie would've been like 10 minutes long and how awesome would it have been if this was a short film. The director has made many shorts in the past and the movies plot was stretched out to such an extent so I think making this a short would've been the better choice. There is a difference with having a formula that causes you to hit a part in the plot that would be deemed predictable once or twice. That's perfectly fine but having such a fully loaded agenda with nothing but cliches and annoyingly obvious jumpscares ruling the movie doesn't add anything good! It just takes away the audience and annoys everyone in the auditorium. In the end, The Forest was an obnoxious film with annoyingly obvious plot devices. The cinematography was good and there were some cool scenes but everything else made me cringe. Not a good start to 2016. I'm giving this one a 3.5/10."

      "text": "Like many I was pulled in by the potentially awesome setting of Aokigahara (the \"Suicide Forest\") and it's lead actress Natalie Dormer (Hunger Games, Game of Thrones). I really wish I hadn't been. \"The Forest\" manages to miss out any potential creepiness it's setting could have brought. All potential is squandered in what is just a really boring horror movie.\r The big emphasis here is less on horror and more on telling a story. There are some interesting ideas floating around here and there, but the director doesn't know how to deliver them. What we get is a film that majorly consists of Dormer walking around Japan and eventually Aokigahara. There's a lot of talking going on while this is happening. It's just hard to care about it thanks to the subpar acting coming from everyone involved. Dormer looked just as bored with the material as I was.\r When the movie does finally get around to trying to scare us it falls even shorter. We get a few glimpses of some ghosts or \"Y\u016brei,\" but director Jason Zada is unable to make them scary. Mostly because all they do is just stand there. The rest of the attempts at horror consist of snapping branches and whispering voices. Wow. How terrifying.\r I respect it's attempts to be a more psychological horror experience. It tries hard to be deeper than the average scary flick and Zada does try to capitalize on the creepiness of the setting. Unfortunately the movie just fails at both. The end results are a boring, poorly acted, unfrightening experience. One better left forgotten despite the talent in it's lead and setting."

One of my fellow user reviewers was absolutely right (after giving it a 10) \u2013 it is \u201cmental scary\u201d and not \u201chorror scary.\u201d What I would say is that it is psychological horror (that is, something like Hitchcock\u2019s Psycho \u2013 the horror is Norman\u2019s mind) instead of \u201cplace-based\u201d horror such in Insidious. In some great horror films like The Haunting of Hill House, both types of horror appear \u2013 one of the characters is deranged but the house is also haunted. In The Forest, I thought the situation was interesting, the actors, especially Natalie Dormer (who seemed to get a good review no matter how much a professional critic hated the film), the locale was fresh and interesting, and the pace and direction was very good.

Additionally, the ending may have been a twist, but it was quite dull. It didn't really become a \"sum\" to the movie. And I get that not all movies have a happy ending, but this one didn't even really have much of an ending at all for that matter. I understand cliffhangers and the whole bit, but it seemed as if something else was supposed to happen, having the ending leave me with the reaction of, \"That's it? There's not any more?\". I completely understand why the movie got a 34/100 (at the time of this review). Most of the horror scenes were, in fact, shown in the trailer, so most of the movie was expected as it progressed. Additionally, this movie followed the stereotype of a typical horror film. The protagonist faces encounters with ghosts and creepy girls, as she makes the obvious wrong decisions throughout, while making each movement of her muscles slow and steady. Not to mention, the action of this movie didn't really start until the last 20-25 minutes of the film. Overall, I would not see this movie again.

In overall, the setup is solid, and as well is the atmosphere, but unfortunately as the movie goes on the story starts to lose itself, and by the third act you don't care anymore, and what started as a mostly interesting and investing story with a creepy atmosphere and suspenseful scenes, eventually becomes a repetitive and predictable galore of questionable character decisions, clich\u00e9s and jumpscares and ends on a dry note.

Despite this very interesting plot I walked into the theater with very low expectations.\r That mindset proved helpful from the second the movie began. Not only was the opening scene shaky but my friend sat in old ketchup. I could tell this movie was doomed. Let me go into more detail about the film. The main character Sara must venture to Japan in hopes of finding her twin sister Jess who mysteriously disappeared in the \"Suicide Forest\". With the help of a local guide and another mysterious traveler, Sara and her new friends endeavor into the forest. To the movies benefit the Suicide Forest does in fact exist which gave it a very eerie and realistic feel. After endless jump scares which only had an impact because of the booming sound in the theater, I realized I had wasted my money.\r Now I realize the movie was not all about jump scares and more of a psychological fear but it was extremely predictable. At times the movie honestly felt like a Scream movie when the main character makes the obviously poor decision to do exactly what everyone warns her not to do. As an avid movie goer I don't usually regret a ticket purchase, this was certainly a first.\r Overall this movie had great potential. I do give credit to the actors for doing their best with poor directing choices. This movie was definitely not for me, and I doubt it was for many people. It's always disappointing to have a movie with such potential just rot away in the box office. Personally I hope someone tries this again, but with a much more interesting style.

My expectations were pretty low, which can actually be a good thing: if the movie sucks, I'm prepared, but if it's good it'd be a pleasant surprise.\r The film starts out with the main character of Sara (Natalie Dormer) searching for her identical twin sister, Jess, who has gone missing in the Aokigahara Forest in Japan where she currently lives. The forest, nicknamed the \"suicide forest\", is a palce where Japanese residents go to commit suicide, leaving their bodies for park rangers to find (yes, this is actually a real thing).\r Seeking a guide to take her into the forest, Sara enlists the help of Aiden (Taylor Kinney), a reporter\rwriting for an Australian news outlet. Aiden resides in Tokyo and is fluent in Japanese and knows a guide to aid Sara. With the help of her two new allies in Aiden and Michi, they explore the forest until they come across Jess's tent. Intent on finding her sister, Sara refuses to leave and return in the morning, not heeding all of the warnings locals have given her about the strange happenings of what goes on in the forest. People are haunted by spirits of the dead, causing them great paranoia and hallucinations and ultimately causing their suicides.\r Sara and Aiden stay the night, but Sara's ghostly visitors lead her away from camp and start to wreak havoc on her psyche. Becoming evermore paranoid, Sara begins to distrust Aiden, believing that he knew Jess and had a part to play in her disappearance.\r Sara eventually escapes from Aiden and continues her search for Jess, encountering more spirits and losing her sanity in the process. After falling into an underground cave and more paranormal experiences, Aiden rescues Sara and they happen upon an abandoned ranger station Aiden had found, piquing Sara's distrust of Aiden even more. After a struggle, Sara winds up stabbing and killing Aiden. As Sara is traveling through the forest, she sees Jess and goes after her, but Jess is equally as paranoid and runs off.\r The backstory of Sara and Jess goes into the death of their parents, initially told to be a drunk driving accident, but we are shown that their father killed their mother and himself. Jess saw their bodies but Sara didn't, which caused Jess's troubled upbringing and multiple suicide attempts.\r In a scene where Sara thinks her father is trying to kill her, she pries his hand off of her arm with a knife. Jess manages to escape the forest and finds the help of authorities that have been searching for her, including Sara's boyfriend Rob. Sara is revealed to actually have slit her own wrist when trying to escape the illusion of her father, and is then pulled into the ground by multiple arms coming our of the earth. As Jess and the authorities postpone their search for the night, Michi looks back into the forest one last time and sees the ghastly apparition of a now deceased Sara.\r While this movie wasn't all that scary, the tension ran high throughout and the constant paranoia made for an uneasy watching experience. Because my expectations were so low for this film, I wound up enjoying it more than I thought I would.\r My rating: 6 out of 10"

And also the scene where she died it's **** stupid. She gets grabbed by a zombie and to free herself she decided to cut her wrist.Normally I would give this 4/10 but I have to balance people that gave this a 10"

I would of liked if they both escaped, both died or if Aiden actually was the villain and ended up trying to or killed Jess. Some scenes looked beautifully shot, mainly of The Forest. Had to doc a point for the Dad\u2019s makeup because holy hell it looked awful. All in all, not a horrible film but not a great one."
