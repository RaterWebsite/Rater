This may or may not be a good thing. The dialogue was a bit long, but the humour was refreshing. At least the ending was unpredictable, but it still lacked the ultimate punch for me to rate this higher. On the whole, it wasn't too bad, but didn't exactly knock me off my feet."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Not a bad story, bud sadly let down by poor casting. Jack Nicholson is as highly watchable as ever, but Demi Moore proves yet again that she is one of the worst actress of her generation. She stinks in everything she's done, and dont let me get started on Tom Cruise's wooden performance. Yikes !! The courtroom scene is sadly let down by La Cruise's hambone performance, as he is outclassed by Jack. With better casting it could have been so much more."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "You definitely enjoy any Nicholson's movie, but I have to agree with other critics, the cast could have been better, Moore's performance it's poor, why does she always seems to have tears in her eyes? is she always crying? Anyway, Tom always acts the same every time his characters belong to any of the armed forces, so maybe someone else for the job. Still a a manageable movie with an epic scene, from Jack Nicholson of course."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A Few Good Men is a smart courtroom drama with a brilliant story and great perfromances from Cruise, Nicholson, Pollak, Bacon and Sutherland (solid performance from Demi Moore). Also sharp direction from Rob Reiner"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "\"A Few Good Men\" is a 1992 courtroom drama film Directed by Rob Reiner and starring Tom Cruise. The story follows a young lawyer's plight to defend two marines accused of murder. Now I know just about everyone's heard of this film. If they haven't, they've at least heard of the line, \"You can't handle the truth!\" That line is just a snippet of the greatness that is weaved into this film. Starting off on a related note, the script is fantastic. Aaron Sorkin strikes again with his rapier wit and compelling dialogue. The story is a very compelling look at the military definitions of honor and loyalty and how they can sometimes become misinterpreted. Some of the lines in this film are also spectacularly memorable. However, while the screenplay is decidedly impressive, the most imposing aspect of this film is the performances within it. Every single actor in this film brought their best to the table, and it's because of the unbelievably captivating performance from Jack Nicholson that everyone else raised their bars. Nicholson's really only in this film for about 10 or 15 minutes, but man does he make those minutes count with his caustic and snide portrayal of Colonel Nathan R. Jessup. Again, it's his performance that caused everyone else in this film to bring their a-games, and holy crap did they. Tom Cruise, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Bacon, J.T. Walsh, Kiefer Sutherland, Demi Moore, all did unbelievable jobs with their respective characters. Even Wolfgang Bodison, a stagehand who had never acted before in his life, did a really beautiful job with his role. The aforementioned fact is a real testament to the seemingly limitless talent of Rob Reiner. After watching the special features of the film, you really get a good idea that Reiner forged an effective relationship with his actors and offered some acting tips of his own for their performances. Because this is such a character driven story, Reiner made a great choice in offering some of his own acting expertise to his cast. Overall, I felt that \"A Few Good Men\" was a really masterfully directed, beautifully written, unforgettably performed coatroom drama that is sure to impress anyone."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "ArE The cRiTiCS SMoKING CRACK???????????????????????????????????????????????"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This movie is well known as one of the biggest court movies of all time. This movie really amazes me with it's great actors and great storytelling. The characters are very intrrguing and captivating. Especially, Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson. With Jack, I think he gave an excellent performance (as usually), but isn't in this movie a whole lot. You only see him in the beginning and the end of the movie. But boy does he make up for his dissaperance when he yells out \"YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!\" That line right there is truly a tremendous quote and one of the biggest movie quotes of all time. Which leads me to another plus that this movie has. Great Screenplay. As far as negativity, the movie kind of streches in some scenes, but overall, it's truly one of the best court movies ever made."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "A Few Good Men is a courtroom drama mainly more than anything because most of the film happens is a courtroom lol. Although we do get glimpses of the outside world and parts outside the courtroom especially the acting is top notch in terms of pure talent. The story is pretty simple however most of you if not all have seen A Few Good Men so won't bore you with step by step storyline pieces. An all star cast such as Kevin Pollak, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Demi Moore grace our screens and all give excellent performances however Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson steal the movie for me. Jack Nicholson is simply boss and Tom Cruise is hilarious as hell in some scenes and convincing. It's a drama/thriller directed by Rob Reiner and delivers powerful speeches, performances and downright ballsy confrontations and dialogue but some hilarious at times too. The use of colour and brightness is shown on display and the chemistry between the actors especially Tom Cruise and Demi Moore is utterly spectacular. Great film."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "One of the best big budget hollywood films of the 90s. There are a few scenes involving exchanges between the main characters that you want to re-play again and again."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "So my pal Lohnny and I are driving through La Verne, California, on our way to see this movie at a really big theater (with plush seating and accommodations for the hearing impaired). Anyway, I can see this car stopped at a red light about 100 yeards down the road, inside of which looks like 3 or 4 teenage boys hanging bare asses out the back and side windows to nobody in particular. So I drive up next to them to see what's what. The guys all dropped down, revealing a 70 year old woman at the wheel. At first, she's appears to be hiding her face, probably embarrassed by the boys.... Then all of a sudden, she looks right at me (and Lohnny, who is now transfixed), she sticks out her tongue much further than I thought possible (especially by this old lady), and she begins licking her lips, cheecks and brow in a slow, deranged fashion. I look over at Lohnny who by now has lost all color in his face, his eyes bulging like he'd seen a ghost. The light turns green and he yells, DRIVE!, so I drove. The most perverse, Texas Chainsaw Massacre Family moment in my young life. By the way, the movie was damned good, though.  \"YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!\""}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Was actually pretty good. Solid acting (although Demi Moore sucked hard in it) and it was an interesting story that ended perfectly. I really enjoyed it."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Jack Nicholson's court room performance is unforgettable, but the rest of the cast nearly is."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Terrific performances and engrossing story but certain elements of the screenplay don't ring true."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Nicholson, unsurprisingly, is the stand-out here. The other actors create cliched, recycled characters, and the plot is mediocre, especially for a legal drama. It does; however, have a few short moments of greatness, and those moments make it worth the while."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A conventional but very well executed drama, A Few Good Men doesn't have much mystery in it, but the good performances and assured direction go along way towards making it engaging.  The story is pretty solid, but I don't want to spoil it for you.  I'll just say that it does deal with some decently heavy issues.  Jack Nicholson gives what is probably the movie's best performance, but Cruise and Moore are both solid here as well.  It might not be the most unpredictable movie in the world, but it is a satisfyingly well made crowd pleaser."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Good thriller with some top actors and an interesting military story. Today it is a classic court movie."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "A great legal drama I see as cult classic. It has a great story, strong actors and an interesting moral / legal dilemma. The story evolves around an incident at the Guantanmo Bay Naval base in Cuba. A US Marine died after being attacked by two fellow Marines. However this could been ordered by an Officer as a Code Red that went wrong. A Code Red is a violent (extrajudicial) punishment inside the military. As sidenote: By research I found out it seems those really exist but were called \u201cBlanket party\u201d. Back to the movie. It is the task of 2 JAG lawyers to defend the suspects and find out the truth. I stop here to avoid spoilers. The story is immersive, has good twists and kept me engaged for the whole time. I normally do neither like or hate legal dramas but this one is a must see. A lot of my enjoyment aside the story and moral dilemma came from the actors. Tom Cruise, Demi Moore and Jack Nicholsen are amazing. But it ends not there as we got also Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Kevin Pollack and a lot of other talented actors. The combination of a great story and actors that fully deliver is a true strength. I think I have said enough. Overall I give a 10/10 because of the high entertainment value, great story and well performing actors. I do not know why this movie is a bit forgotten today."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "\"\u00a1You can't handle the truth!\" Unfortunately an catchy phrase can't be the support of a movie when you have the feeling nothing ever happens except for boring dialogues. Sorry for the wasted casting. Dismiss at 1h09s."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "i want the truth..A Few Good MenWhen it comes to create intense and high pitched drama scenes it doesn't fail to deliver for it mostly relies upon the performance since it seems to loose its hold of it on the rest of it. A Few Good Men has fast paced script, enough content to feed the audience for more than 2 hours and contains a power packed performance with amazing dialogues and compelling arguments in it. Rob Reiner is not in its A game since its execution seems a bit petty, childish and amateur as its loosely packed in between big moments. Tom Cruise is amazing in it with a good supporting cast like Jake Nicholson and Demi Moore. A Few Good Men hits fast and hard with an exhilarating first act but dips down a bit in the second one only to escalate into delivering stunning climax."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Really good courtroom drama.  The whole cast is excellent and the story is great as well"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This is a solid courtroom drama film, set in the world of the US military. I can't say I'm in any way an expert in the area but I did find it surprising that Guantanemo Bay was mentioned numerous times, given this film dates from the early 1990s and I suppose I assumed that facility was set up in the early 2000s, prior to, or just following, 9/11. In any case, this film features a very solid cast and I'd say Jack Nicholsons performance was probably the best, in my view. It features the famous line of dialogue 'TRUTH?! YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!!' which I'd certainly heard of but I hadn't realised it came from this film. Its powerful at times, although it does drag a little in some scenes with Tom Cruises cocky, smug character trying to shrug some things off etc. That irritated me but I see the points I assume were intended given the script. I believe this film is based on the play by Aaron Sorkin and its, for the most part, a solid story. I liked that it includes the female character, Lt. Cdr. JoAnne Galloway, played by Demi Moore, who has to deal with men who aren't entirely keen on dealing with a female in a high rank like herself.I reckon its still quite a relevant film, given stories we hear nowadays about people serving in the army/navy etc. accused of things. Its a thought provoking watch and although it is a little slow in places, for a courtroom drama its by no means bad. Overall, yes I would recommend this film."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I'm not a real courtroom drama fan. But this movie is more about a young man coming of age. Maturing. Getting past his fears. Great performances by the entire cast. Jack Nicholson & Tom Cruise blow it outta the park. This movie is in my top 5 most loved movies of all time. And I'm primarily a sci-fi fan. Go figure. You're god damn right you better watch this movie because you'll love it as well."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "While certainly entertaining, A Few Good Men has its limitations. Both the legal mechanics and the military ethics are overplayed to the extent that they are no longer believable, making the film susceptible to sentamentalism. Cruise's persona, however charismatic, doesn't help. Moore's character is useless. Nicholson - by contrast - is strong, so strong in fact that it backfires, leaving Cruise's eventual triumph emptied like a surreal twist, despite having been preordained from the first scene."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Tiene una muy buena historia, pero los actores brindan unas fenomenales interpretaciones."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Predictable courtroom drama.Only memorable thing from the movie is the \"You can't handle the truth\" line."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "jest to jeden z najlepszych film\u00f3w w jakim tom cruise zagra\u0142, bo wtedy jeszcze gra\u0142 no stara\u0142 si\u0119 ,a nie gwiazdorzy\u0142 jak teraz"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Eine Frage der Ehre ist ein Gerichtsdrama mit Tom Cruise und Demi Moore in den Hauptrollen. Die beiden Soladaten Dawson und Downy sollen ihren Kollegen Santiago umgebracht haben. Dieser bat mehr mals um Verlegung in ein anderen St\u00fctzpunkt. Aber dazu kam es nicht, weil er ermordet wurde. Wollten die beiden Soldaten dies? Wurden sie beauftragt? Vor dem Milit\u00e4rgericht werden die beiden Soldaten von Daniel Kaffee ( Tom Cruise) und JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore) verteidigt. Daniel Kaffee ist ein arroganter, unerfahrener Anwalt, welcher sich innerhalb des Films weiterentwickelt. Ich finde den Film sehr interessant und spannend. Tom Cruise spielt seine Rolle sehr gut. Jack Nicklson hat in diesem Film eine kleine Rolle, die er aber brilliant spielt und zu Recht eine Oscar Nominierung hatte. Ich habe zwar f\u00fcr mich spannendere und interessantere Gerichtsfilme gesehen. Dieser hier ist trotzdem spannend und unterhaltsam. Man erf\u00e4hr \u00fcber das Leben und Milit\u00e4r und die Dialoge sind fantastisch. Der Regisseur Rob Reiner inzeniert hier einen guten Film mit gutgeschriebenen Charakteren und guten Dialogen.
