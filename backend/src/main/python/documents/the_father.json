Every aspect from the direction, pov story-telling, clever production design and especially the performances are outstanding.  Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman, what a combination!  Hopkins gives a masterful performance for the ages. His last scene is stunning and will stay with me long after. While Hopkins is the soul of the film, Colman is the heart and emotion.  She conveys the anguish and frustration with the slightest change in her eyes and expression. You can\u2019t help but empathize with her. Don\u2019t hesitate to see this film. Yes, the subject matter is depressing but it\u2019s a universal story that should not be missed."

This is one of those films that just thinking about it or thinking about a specific scene will get my eyes teary. I\u2019m honestly blown away by how moved I was by it. One of the best movies of 2020. Anthony Hopkins gives one of the best performance since \u2018Silence of the Lambs\u2019. You may think that you've seen everything the veteran actor has to offer, but he continues to surprise and amaze us. He broke my heart a thousand times, especially the last five minutes which was some of the most powerful pieces of acting on screen. On the other hand, he\u2019s also incredibly charming and funny as his character that it made him so mesmerizing to watch. I usually don\u2019t care when it comes to awards, but I genuinely hope he gets some recognition at the Oscars with at least a nomination or maybe a win, because he is truly brilliant in this movie.Olivia Colman, who plays Anthony's daughter, Anne, was also fantastic in the movie. Her facial expressions solid every emotion that the character was feeling and Colman is an expert at it. The pain, frustration, and the overwhelming love she has for her father, as she tries to find ways of helping him. I can\u2019t imagine a more dreadful sight than watching your loved one decay away before your eyes and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. While there have been other movies in the past that tackled the topic of dementia and old age on a surface level, where it mainly focuses on how friends and family coop with a significant others condition. However, this movie makes those films look flat in comparison. What makes this movie so different and yet more effective is that it\u2019s told from the perspective of the sufferer. So, his confusion becomes ours. Simple things like switching Olivia Colman with a different actor can have a huge and scary impact, because when this first happened I was stunned, but I quickly realise this is the devastating reality of the disease where people you once knew start to look alienating to you.Director Florian Zeller dose an excellent job of placing you in the shoes of someone going through dementia and have a better understanding of how the disease can affect you. Any other film marker would\u2019ve done the predictable approach, which is to go over the top with the possibilities of presenting a surreal nightmare with flashy visuals, as a way to show off crazy camera work and digital effects, but Zeller instead keeps things grounded enough while in the imaginary world inside the characters head. It\u2019s true what they say, less is more.The movie is purposely structured and edited in a disorganised lucid dream-like manner, where certain elements such as the mention of names and the appearance of faces are a mystery to us just like the main character. Who are these people? Why is everything so mysterious? When you try to piece things together with the collection of scattered memories of events, it then gets shuffled around. Although, the movie isn\u2019t as complicated as it may sound, it's just not straight forward narrative wise. It was like watching a horror movie at times with the horrific effects of dementia. Your brain, metaphorically, is like a tree branch filled with leaves, but eventually with the slow effect of the disease, you will lose your leaves. Overall rating: A magnificent movie that helps us understand the struggle and experience of dementia that was executed with extra care. It also goes beyond that in many different ways that I have yet to unlock in my first viewing. It\u2019s a movie that I will never forget."

      "text": "Moving from non-diegetic sound to diegetic sound of classical music the dementia-afflicted titular father is listening to while relaxing, we right away found ourselves slipping into his mind and, subsequently, descending into his deteriorating mental state. Thus, we're instantly warned that what we're going to witness of events are, by and large, untrustworthy. Adopting such narration technique isn't the easiest to pull off, never mind when applied to a character-driven story doubting \"the fabric of his reality.\" For in case it failed, the story would be in total shambles (Capone is a case in point, assuming that was its intent in first place); and if it paid off, the story would offer us a sympathetic look at its main character. Florian Zeller managed to do the near-impossible, generating empathy towards a character we're not suffering from what it suffers by tapping on the truth we relentlessly evade each time we see our grandparents, for instance, fail to recall words, our names or even to recognise who we are while they're doing their utmost to convince us otherwise. This film embraces this fear to a disturbingly horrifying degree. We found ourselves pondering over what we see as an impending condition so much so we're simultaneously letting the uneasiness dominates our thoughts while we're sitting watching the movie.Zeller also managed here to give The Father a clinical quality reminiscent of psychological horror films to keep us always on the verge of being painfully unsettled at any time. High pitched sharp sounds and disquietingly cozy furniture(s) are here to accentuate this feeling so that a little boundary-pushing moment would send a shiver down the spine along with some suppressed tears begging to be shed. And then we have Hopkins delivering a tour de force performance that will soon or later be regarded as one of his best. Through his character, we see him in an utter bewilderment, incessantly trying to figure out what's happening around him and make sense of all that \"nonsense\" in such manner that force you to do so along with him. That's the definition of an engaging performance. Another thing I noticed through his facial expressions is the that he seems to be constantly processing his surroundings as well as every words he hears. A truly brilliant performance that dictates how similar characters should be played. I'm really hoping Riz Ahmed wins since it would be his first Oscar but, truth be told, Sir Hopkins is more worthy of it. Olivia Colman is absolutely amazing as always, but it's Imogen Poots as the nurse (Laura) that caught me off guard with the scenes she shares with Anthony. The spontaneity of elderly people that can be inadvertently offensive and their fear of being mocked at or at least of being treated rather as children collide here in way that made me continuously switch back and forth between sympathising towards each of them. This is a unique, unprecedented cinematic achievement, and definitely my favourite movie of 2020.(10/10)~Spoiler Alert~A spoiler warning here as I'm talking about a certain motif in this movie, that is the \"watch\". Besides the \"apples\" in Pieces of a Woman, this is yet another deft use of motifs in movies from the last year. The watch here indicates Anthony's grasp of the sense of time and age. His watch is first mentioned as being snatched by Laura. Later on, we see Anthony suspects Paul to be wearing his watch. In both occasions, it was the first time for him to be introduced to these characters, and the fact he failed to recognise them made them sources of intimidation that threaten his supposed control over his memory. In the soul-crushing ending scene where he's with his nurse, Catherine, he says that he wants his mom but his nurse corrects that he means his daughter. However, he insists that it's his mom, then he mentions that he wants her and that he's losing his leaves. Then, in a last desperate attempt to convince himself of his sanity, he says that he knows that his watch is on his wrist. From all this we may gather that his last monologue seems to sum up all his life, and his aging to be precise. His life went in full circle and now he's a child again in a pressing need of his mom."

This isn\u2019t the traditionally pitiful old man suffering from confusion, but a plucky, sometimes angry character, who we witness slowly deteriorate.

Through a fragmented narrative, the director puts us in the protagonist's shoes \u2014 a man who has dementia and refusing to accept the help provided by his daughter.I couldn't help to feel lost and confused as I was watching this, but that's exactly to the point: to get an approximation of what this disease is like. The screenplay succeeds in every way by doing this.Anthony Hopkins, of course, gives the performance of a lifetime. It sure was hard for someone like him to assimilate a situation as his character faces, but the result is just great. Sometimes it feels like you're watching a little kid afraid of getting scolded, and others, he's just like a grumpy and mean older man. Again, a performance with so much nuance.Shout out to the production design department for the meticulous effort of building the apartment set. The place is another character in this story, and the way it resonates with Anthony is significant. All in all, a very original film that deserves all its praise."

What differs this movie from others on the same topic is that we see it from Anthony's perspective. Which *reality* is real and which is not? This film gut-wrenchingly depicts a man who not only forgot who people around him were, but he forgot who he was. We can see how infuriating it gets when your brain plays games with you. And how painful it is for loving ones to watch this process of mental deterioration. The movie is a \"must see\"."

Take a movie that you've heard very little about, from a director you've heard virtually nothing about and screen it at a rate of what feels one theater for every five hundred miles (in my area, at least) and you've got quite a long shot in the making. Man, oh, man does this defy the odds. Short of strapping a GoPro to Anthony Hopkins's head, there's no other way this movie could've better portrayed dealing with dementia from a first person perspective. From the manipulation of time, to the malleability of space, to the transience of matter, all of it is utilized for the sole purpose of making you feel as helpless and as confused as our ailing protagonist. God, it's all so genius and perfect in its execution. This is also probably the best performance from Anthony Hopkins since \"The Silence Of The Lambs\" and that's saying A LOT (the man WORKS). Olivia Colman -- as always -- is a damn treasure. Damn it, this was sublime. Easy perfect score."

      "text": "In this subtle yet tender and heartfelt drama, Anthony Hopkins stars as a man suffering from dementia as his daughter (Olivia Colman) and several others around him try to help him in the face of his stubbornness and unwillingness to accept his state. In addition, his mind and sense of reality begin to deteriorate as his memories and ability to identify those around him start to fade away. First off, this film does an incredible job of immersing us in Anthony's state of mind and helping us understand his pov. Several other random and unfamiliar characters pop in and out throughout the film, and their true names and identities are never truly established, so like Anthony, even we, the audience, are also confused and never truly certain of what's going on around us or who these other characters are. If this is the closest some of us can come to experiencing what it's like to suffer from dementia, then the film brilliantly succeeds at giving us a glimpse at what it must feel and be like, and it's rather quite heartbreaking to say the least. Furthermore, Hopkins delivers the most deeply felt and personal-feeling performance of his career. His struggle was sincerely felt by me in every moment. Olivia Colman, who also never fails to impress, gives an equally sincere performance as Anthony's daughter Anne. As far as the overall execution of the film goes, it was adapted for the screen and based off director Florian Zeller's French play 'Le Pere', and since much of the film takes place in an apartment flat, it's easy to see that it was originally meant to be a play. However, this hardly detracts from the rest of the film, as the film's strengths easily outweigh this. Overall, the all-too-real feeling and experience of dementia this film portrays, coupled with a pair of tearjerking performances from Hopkins and Colman help this film shine, even if it does prove ultimately sad and difficult to get through, given the subject matter."

That aside, however, the most likely conclusion to come out of such speculation is not, in fact, at all difficult to decipher before its somewhat uneventful arrival. The film takes a little too long to reach that point, providing audiences with a payoff that's not as unexpected to see coming as the filmmaker seems to think it is. To be sure, the emotions the picture stirs are indeed genuine, but the process through which they're generated could have used less redundancy, despite the twists and turns that arise throughout the course of the film. The picture is indeed a solid effort but not one that's as outstanding as it's being made out to be."

      "text": "An audience will generally accept whatever happens in the first 15 or 20 minutes of a movie to be true to the reality of the story no matter the genre or subject matter. This is when we are being introduced to the characters and their world. Even if a movie begins with a dream or a fantasy, it has told us what is real and what is not. The Father takes full advantage of this to put the audience in the mindset of Anthony, an elderly man with dementia. As you might imagine given the subject matter, this makes for a heavy viewing experience. The Father is that kind of movie that is well made and well-acted but cannot exactly be described as entertainment. The film begins with Anne (Olvia Coleman) meeting her father, Anthony (Anthony Hopkins), at his large, posh London apartment to tell him that she has met a man and will be moving to Paris soon, so she will not be able to look after him anymore. In the next scene Anthony finds a man in his apartment who he (and we) has never seen before claiming to be Anne\u2019s husband. Anne returns from the market but Anthony does not recognize her. Neither do we. Now Anne is played by Olivia Williams and says she is not and never was moving to Paris. Director Florian Zeller, who, along with Chistopher Hampton, adapted The Father from his play, has us share in Anthony\u2019s disorientation and confusion with very effective but simple techniques.Scenes repeat and loop back on themselves. It seems like this movie takes place over the same few days again and again. The Oscar nominated production design makes different apartments look the same but also different. The cinematography finds ways to shoot a room from different angles so we aren\u2019t sure if we are in Anthony\u2019s apartment or his daughter\u2019s apartment. There is a general sense of a timeline (the editing also received an Oscar nomination), but we are never really sure where we are in the timeline. Anthony often points to a painting done by his other daughter, Lucy, but then one time it isn\u2019t there anymore. We see the faint outline that something once hung there. Was the painting removed? Is he in a different apartment that never had the painting and hung something else there?    It will come as no surprise that Anthony Hopkins gives not just a good or very good performance but a great one. His Best Actor Oscar nomination isn\u2019t just a lifetime achievement placeholder. Anthony\u2019s ever-changing mood and perspective requires Hopkins to be agitated, charming, confused, calm, lucid, frightened; often in the same scene. Yet, Hopkins does not use the role just to showcase his talents. Even in the most dramatic scenes his performance is still full of sympathy; we see Anthony the character first and the work of Anthony the actor later. Olivia Coleman is a great scene partner for Hopkins and does a great job conveying her emotions while trying to hold them back. The rest of the small cast is an impressive lineup of great performers: Olivia Williams, Rufus Sewell, Mark Gatiss, and Imogen Poots.  The doubling and repetition of scenes and dialogue are indeed a clever approach to dramatizing the muddled perspective of a dementia sufferer. However, with this effect having been achieved so quickly and completely at the beginning of the film, after a while these techniques lose their power and even become annoying. The movie never gives us an objective reality even in scenes of Anne alone or with her husband. I understand the filmmaker wanting to keep us off kilter to fully convey Anthony\u2019s perspective but there are moments where the film is not from his perspective, including Anne\u2019s dream/nightmare.The final scene is what we presume it will be and is emotionally powerful. While appreciating The Father from an artistic and technical view, I kept wondering who this movie is for. I cannot imagine people who have really had Anne\u2019s experience wanting to relive such devastating experiences. It is not especially grim or dour or mawkish, but it would still be a difficult watch for a movie night (definitely have something light queued up to watch afterward). There are other works of fiction and non-fiction about the effects of dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease and the emotional toll it has on everyone involved, but I suppose this is the only one with an incredible performance from Anthony Hopkins."

I have seen all of the films nominated for Best Picture; and, this is the review of The Father, which is the last one I was able catch up on. It's nominated for 6 awards on Sunday, including: Best Picture, Actor and Adapted Screenplay. Let's see if this movie is worthy of all the accolades.The Father is an adaption of a play of the same name directed by Florian Zeller, who is both the playwright and screenwriter. It tells the story of a man in the throes of dementia and the struggles endured by his worried daughter as she navigates the decline of his mental faculties. The man's mind is unreliable, which makes it more difficult for him to determine what is really happening as his world transforms around him. Anthony Hopkins plays the titular Father, who is named Anthony; and Olivia Colman plays his daughter, Anne.Streamers, I'll be honest - I got a little sleepy watching The Father. I'm actually surprised that it is 1 hour and 32 minutes because it feels longer than that. Now, I don't think that means it is bad, or boring, maybe I was just tired. I will say that The Father can be repetitious and confusing. It seems like that is the point though. Zeller seems to be exploring from both sides of dementia in the two characters of Anthony and Anne. All of the technical aspects of the movie enhance his objective, including the editing and production design. The thing about an adaptation of a play is that it can feel static and claustrophobic. Both are true here, but again, Anthony's emerging dementia lends itself to being depicted in a static, repetitious and claustrophobic way. The filmmakers have used these things and other clever devices to their advantage. The problem is that a casual viewer may get lost and distracted by it all. I think that happened to me.On the upside, Anthony Hopkins is really good in his portrayal. His accolades are well-deserved. Hopkins provides the glimpse into the terror and confusion of losing oneself. Ultimately, it is a deeply affecting and heartbreaking performance.If you are an Oscars completist and feel like you have to see all of the films nominated for Best Picture, then The Father is not a waste of time. Plus, it is short - although it may not at times feel that way. There are interesting ideas about mental health and the care of our parents that permeate throughout; but, if you are not invested, you may get as lost and confused as Anthony - or sleepy like me. Nevertheless, it's definitely worthy of a bowl of popcorn - at least if you rent it from the comfort of your couch."

Dementia-stricken and proud Anthony learns from his daughter Anne that she will soon be moving to Paris. From then on, Zeller narrates the successive decline of Anthony's mind in complex but highly emotional and, above all, human ways.Anthony Hopkins is ideally cast for the lead role of Anthony. On the one hand, he is an empathetic father who means well for his daughter, but on the other, his pride and one-dimensionality make him sullen and critical of her decisions. Hopkins has never been seen in this simplicity. His character does not want to accept that his illness is getting the upper hand and is sure that he can manage without the help of care. At the same time, the increasing memory loss is told exclusively from his point of view, which automatically leads you to sympathise with the protagonist despite his often impossible deeds. This sympathy factor that Hopkins permanently carries with him makes it much easier to relate to him. It is arguably his best performance since his legendary one as Dr Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, albeit much more nuanced and realistic. While the strong female role at his side then was Jodie Foster, this time it is Olivia Colman as Anthony's daughter Anne. She logically disagrees with her father and does everything possible to organise the help he needs before she leaves for Paris. Colman is the heart of the film. She is heartbreaking in this role and often cannot emotionally withstand the pain that the sight of her suffering father causes her. Her chemistry with Hopkins is also very deep and often one would think that the two actually share this kind of father-daughter relationship. Colman is fragile in her individual scenes, but also forcefully strong and always torn about her father's treatment. Rounding out the great cast are Imogen Poots, Rufus Sewell and Olivia Williams, all constantly taking on different roles due to the confusion in Anthony's head. Williams in particular adds an enormous amount of vulnerability to her few moments, especially the final scene.Zeller has succeeded in a very particular kind of filmmaking with The Father. In its simplicity, the film is nevertheless very complexly constructed, especially in the first hour, and one cannot believe that dementia can apparently really trigger this process in a person's head. Because Hopkins does such a fantastic job of translating this and the editing also relies very effectively on surprise and suddenness, it never becomes too much to bear. Zeller also manages not to make the film seem exclusively sad, but also enriches the plot with thoroughly funny interludes. Basically, however, The Father is a sentimental drama that continuously makes hearts beat faster and that you can hardly get through without shedding a tear. An instructive, authentic and fascinating piece of filmmaking that is an absolute hit for a directorial debut and should be seen by everyone despite the vehemence of its subject matter."

My heart goes out to the millions of people that have gone through, are now going through, and may very well go through this life changing occurance with a loved one.  It's not fair, and I wouldn't wish this disease on anyone."

Olivia did a more convincing job of an obedient introvert daughter. so different from her lesbian queen role in 'the favourite'.the star of the movie should be the director ( sadly not nominated), the beautiful apartment setting ( remember 'Amour', the tight editing that compartmentalize the minds of a progressive alzheimer patient."

It makes everything look and feel just like a play in theatre. Acting is pretty good that is nice. Music is very mediocre and forgettable in my opinion. It also serves sometimes not as a background music but as a main focus which i also dislike. Story is very confusing and all over the place which is intended feature because he has dementia and all of that but i think there are better ways to present dementia sick people in a movie, in a way that does not confuse the viewers. It is just a story about old man with dementia. Despite few emotional moments, overall very boring experience."

      "text": "The story revolves around an elderly man suffering from dementia, played to perfection by Hopkins, while his daughter, played by Coleman, deals with the burden of having to care for him while witnessing the decline in his mental health. It is based on a play and it shows as scenes are dialogue-heavy, often set in a single room, and don't feature much camera movement. Regardless of its minor flaws, The Father is still a good movie that features an amazing performance by Hopkins, which alone makes the movie worth checking out."

      "text": "The sense of disorientation evoked by this film made it a compelling and stunning watch. Antony (Hopkins) lives in a strange, revolving door of moments whereby we have no idea whether he is in the past or present. The filmmaker, also the writer, Florian Zeller has taken his French play, La P\u00e8re and brought it to the screen, perhaps giving the most realistic portraying of senility slowly emerging in an aging person. Thankfully, he knows when to ground the viewer's perspective, orient them for awhile before bringing back the confusion. A fine balancing act. I will admit, I was hesitant, and for a while, resistant to watching this one, afraid it would be a gloomy trek. It turns out, this movie not only shows you Antony's frustration with his dementia but the plight and frustration of loved ones around him, namely his daughter (Colman) and her husband (Sewell). It is a compassionate film, and it deeply respects its characters and world without dunking its audience into a heavy morass of depression. By the film's end, there is a sense of hope and yet resignation. Life continues, no matter the pain and the confusion. Beautiful, meaningful. Highly recommended."

I thought Hopkins gave a very convincing performance (as does Olivia Colman) and the way the timeline works is quite clever - it leaves the viewer perhaps questioning what the titular father questions (I'll say no more so as not to provide full blown spoilers). It isn't what I'd regard an unnecessarily over exploitative sentimental type film, I'm glad to say.  It seemed very true to life, for what little I know. Yes I'd recommend it."

I've fortunately never been around someone with what this film depicts, yet it still came across as very realistic - based on what I have heard about the condition.Hopkins is utterly superb in the lead role, which is what I expected given I had heard about this 2020 flick back when it won the big gongs. Something I hadn't heard about, though, was Colman's performance - which is absolutely fantastic, particularly in one emotional scene alongside Hopkins and Imogen Poots.A very saddening but brilliant film, cleverly portrayed too."
