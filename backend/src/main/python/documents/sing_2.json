But with no connections, he and his singers must sneak into the Crystal Entertainment offices, run by the ruthless wolf mogul Jimmy Crystal, where the gang pitches the ridiculous idea of casting the lion rock legend Clay Calloway in their show. Buster must embark on a quest to find the now-isolated Clay and persuade him to return to the stage.",

      "text": "I must say I am very confused by this movie's 7.9 user score rating. (Especially because Encanto, a much stronger movie, only has a 6.9) It's not bad at all, (in fact, it's one of Illumination's better movies) but it's not great either.The actors and animation are really good, as is much of the music, but it's dragged down by some pacing problems. A lot of the character drama is good in a vacuum but feels kinda rushed and glossed over in execution, which made it difficult to stay invested throughout the second act. Also, I wasn't really invested in most of the new characters. (I legit. don't know what people see in Porsha.)I think it's better than a lot of other movies with a 49 for their main score, it arguably deserves slightly higher, but a truly great movie it is not. Still, it's decent enough and worth a watch, especially if you liked the first one."

I went in to see this movie with \"meh\" expectations since I thought the first one was just okay. I am so glad to be proven wrong! I turn 18 in 3 days and I saw this movie in theaters with my 18-year-old best friend and my mom - all 3 of us laughed out loud at more than one point and I nearly cried during the scene with Clay and Ash singing with the audience. I'm not ashamed to admit that this is my new favorite animated film.I loved Johnny's arc in particular - Taron played him PERFECTLY, his emotions were so real. The conflict between him and Klaus and the immediate bond between him and Nooshy was so inspiring, and to see him flourishingly rise above Klaus's abuse in \"Sky Full Of Stars\"... I was bouncing in my seat and cheering him on. Of course, everyone else's stories were played out phenomenally, too."

The plot is fast paced and doesn't slow down through the entire runtime, it is very good natured and heartwarming and you can't help but root for the crew of characters. There is a nice payoff at the end of the film, and some nice humour throughout. The soundtrack is better than the first film, and has some well known hit songs that are appropriately used in the film, they fit well with the animation and dont seem to be tacked on. The quality of the animation is really well done throughout, on second watch I spotted more details and enjoyed the film almost as much as the first time round.This is a really good film for all the family to watch and enjoy together."

This is such a sad day for humanity because it has shown us that audiences really will gobble up whatever cheap, lazy and uninspired but quote-unquote \u201cvisually appealing\u201d animated slop that\u2019s put in front of them. The bar for animation has now been set so low that this kind of worthless movie has been placed on the same level as Toy Story 2, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Up, Coco and Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse, (which all won an Oscar except the first, which won a Golden Globe), and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, which won 11 Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director. That is what the world has come to. I feel like I\u2019ve been slugged in the gut 100 times. It just defies all explanation. It blows my mind right out of my skull, but not in a good way. I guess the only thing I can do now is agree with what Agent Smith says in The Matrix: humankind really is a virus."

      "text": "It felt like the plot of Sing 2 existed to give the film an opportunity to squeeze in hit pop tunes rather than those songs being in the movie as a way to advance the plot. This is the film's biggest issue as the characters all feel one dimensional and impossible to connect with. The constant pop music also really took me out of the movie. At times it felt more like listening to the radio than watching a film. The animation is also extremely standard for Illumination as it fails to make any improvements over its predecessor in this vein. I laughed at a few of the jokes, but the comedy was generally very simplistic and underwhelming. Overall, this is a fine movie to watch with the family, but it certainly isn't up to par with the best animated films of the year(Encanto, The Mitchells vs The Machines, Luca)."

The emotional scenes were completely cut off, leaving the bland plot and few jokes on the spotlight. The whole story flashes with the speed of light making you just marvel at the oversaturated scenes without feeling something. If they gave more time for developing of the movie I think that they would have fixed the issues, but at the end of the day-business is business."

What im seeking in a sing movie is pop culture and yes what a suprise that this movie have good enough selected songs esepicially that grub hub ad song that we all hate a while ago but the song it's not as appealing as sing 1 does 5 years ago because the pop culture in it it's not enough. Suprisingly this movie is a good enough sequel not that good and not that bad usually sequel's have a bad reputation towards the original story like for example Venom 2, Finding dory, Cars 2, etc. Thank god they get rid of that little white mouse from the franchise i disliked him so much and they replace him with some new character's which is good enough, yeah i thinks that's about it im always feel neutral towards kid's movies nowadays because well were not kids anymore so we cannot experience that wonderful feeling of nostalgia with movies like this."

I loved how we got to see how the characters grew and how they are able to overcome the challenges they faced throughout the movie. I love the overall message of the movie, to prove others wrong and to show that you can accomplish anything if you believe in yourself and know your worth. That inspired me :)).  I also LOVE the songs in this movie, ive had the songs stuck in my head for the past couple of dayssss and ahhh i dont think they are gonna go away any time soon.
