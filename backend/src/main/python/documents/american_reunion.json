Pretty much every character I can think of makes at least a cameo and the development of all of their relationships falls into place and gives a closure that really feels like this is finally the conclusion the series needed all along. Of course, this movie isn't for everyone. It's as vulgar as any of them, graphic (especially if you watch the unrated), and profane so it's definitely something that some people would not enjoy. However, if you don't care about any of that stuff and just want a good laugher, this should do the trick."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I saw American Reunion the day it came out and as it turns out, it is better than I thought it would be. The schemes of Jim, Oz, Kevin, Steve, and Finch get themselves into trouble, but it becomes clever when they get out of it. Steve Stifler is at his best, most clever, and funniest actions, the dialogue is well-added to reunification of the characters and occasionally funny, and the revival of the minor characters is surprisingly wonderful; Especially the Shermanator, Nadia, and John Cho who plays Harold in Harold & Kumar. And you know what, even with recyclements from the first, it is better than American Pie 2 and The Wedding in almost every way. Compared to those two, I think it is worth seeing for American Pie fans even though it is not on the same measurements as the first slice of Pie. Besides, along the way, it's hilarious, it's moments of reunification are engaging, and there's a lot of wild Adult-Teen fun. It also succeeds at regaining the pleasantness of the first two and is less gross than American Wedding. However, I'll be honest: It's immature seeing Jim, Kevin, Finch, Oz, and Stifler doing immature things in their 30s but it reminds why we liked them for doing immature things in the first, they're still there for each other, and it's nice to see every character reunited. In fact, it's so worth seeing you get to see your favorite characters do funny things you never get to see them do in the first three that is surprisingly entertaining, especially Jason Stifler's Mom meeting Jim's Dad but I won't give out a lot of spoilers. American Reunion is a reunion worth going to... SEE... FOR LAUGHS.

The bad: movie sometimes doesn't juggle the heart felt moments and the comedy good, predictable plot points, bland story.  In the end:  yes this movie does have some serious problems, and some would be a deal breaker if the movie wasn't funny.

It follows the same formula.  And, as anticipated, being a \"reunion\" movie means one is bound to have a failed marriage, another is likely to question their career path, and one couple of old flames will get back together. It's all very routine, and brings reason and justification to its long-over-due end. 'Reunion' simply doesn't feel like anything new was ever thought of upon its creation; instead, it feels as if filmmakers studied the previous installments, added marriage and children into the mix, casted some new fill-ins, and changed little else. The film begins on a couple unsensibly tactless and unfunny notes, all while conspicuously focusing on Stifler to create laughs, and finally refines its crassness, albeit slightly, later. As I found myself watching 'Reunion', I couldn't help but notice the change in the degree of humor since its first installment; the gags are repeated, but aren't nearly as affecting as they once were. Also, the film's attempts to wring out as much sex from its \"reunion\" themes comes across as forced and desperate. One instance, in particular, shows Jim playing off the \"I remember you from somewhere...\" motif. He runs into a newly \"legal\" teenage girl who he used to baby-sit. Naturally, the film sees that she is topless, and ready for Jim to defile. Why a married man with a child, contemplating the seduction of an eighteen year old girl, who in fact he used to watch under his care...as a child, is material that is purported to bring about laughs is sickening to even consider. But, nevertheless, the audiences behind me cry out in riotous cacchination over its \"humor.\" The same idea is repeated all throughout the film, as Stifler is shown attempting to titillate the fancies of a group of stereotypical, obtuse-minded beach babes, making references to current-day pop culture. By this time, the deplorable pursuits at comedy are more than soaked up; no, its been dead for thirteen years. Ultimately, \"American Reunion\" is exactly what fans and newcomers, alike, expect from the latest installment; the former couldn't love it more, while newbies couldn't like it less. Without knowing the characters beforehand, the film is seen as another dumbed-down, sex-comedy featuring the disturbingly familiar motif of married men flirting with the concept of cheating on their spouses with teenage girls, and from that, expecting to generate laughs. Having seen the previous films, 'Reunion' doesn't even come close to matching the effect of its original or seconder, but does just what one expects in concluding a still classic title series; not laugh-out-loud, but still offering some comedic relief. As a late-night-filler-theater-trip-with-friends, the film fulfills its role--and likely its budget--with familiar faces and old, but nostalgic gags."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Nearly a decade later, this orthodox fourth installment of AMERICAN PIE shuffles along with a reunion gimmick which encompasses almost exactly the same gags and repellent discomforts as in its groundbreaking first episode came around 1997, which makes one wonder the audience's laughing threshold is still on the par with the level 15 years ago. There are ample laughters from A to Z, no one-liner or wisecrack, mainly generated by risqu\u00c3\u00a9 pranks and lecherous sex-related pratfalls.

Up till this point though the only teen comedies aroundwere Clueless, Ferris Bueller and a few unworthy imitations. SinceAmerican Pie dazzled with its gross out and sexually charged humour,other teen films have come in to take up the mantle. Napoleon Dynamite,Mean Girls and Easy A have stolen American Pie's thunder in teen comedyand Bridesmaids and The Hangover have stolen it in gross out. But canAmerican Pie reclaim its prior glory.Well firstly the leads are a little old to come under teen comedy,despite them harking back to the old days, the characters have moved ona bit. The moving on is superficial and to be honest only Jim andStiflers story lines have any impact whatsoever, so no it won't betaking the crown back. The film was unbelievably predictable, you couldsee the ending right from the beginning, but the ride was stillenjoyable. There were some very funny moments, the opening scenes havealways been among the funniest in the series and this one really didmake me giggle. Its all crude stuff and you know it's going to be, ofcourse Stifler takes crude to a new level and always has, but that'swhat makes his character so lovable.American Pie Reunion doesn't quite have the ingenuity that HorribleBosses has, nor the surprise that The Hangover has, nor the wit of EasyA or even the believable friendships that Bridesmaids has. What it doeshave is nostalgia, and it works by reminding the audience of what hasgone before it. Yes it is funny, but with the characters ageing tenyears the style of comedy could have been a little more inventive. Butthen again is this what the audience wants or is that just me?One thing that stood out to me as rather annoying, is making the gaypeople in the film the butt of the joke. In this day and age, withAmerican's finally coming round to equality to homosexuality, it's sobackwards to see gay people used in this way.In the end it all works out though.

Interesting that screenplay duty is given to new hands and not to Adam Herz, who wrote all three original films. Unfortunately, the change of writers does not result in a contemporary update to the series.Never the wittiest of comedies, the humour hasn't changed in the slightest and this time around some of the gags are a little too crude and predictable. Guess what, the pages are stuck together in Jim's old porno mags when his Dad catches him (again) having a look for old times sake. That's not to say that the film isn't funny, it definitely has its moments, and those mostly revolve around Stifler. Stifler always was the funniest character and Seann William Scott steals every scene he appears in with his juvenile enthusiasm and foul mouth. Jim and his Dad share some quite intimate scenes and Jason Biggs and Eugene Levy must be credited for the on-screen relationship they have developed over the years.Appearing to have grown up, the characters return for a 13 year high school reunion. Similar to the other films, Jim manages to get in yet another predicament due to his ineptitude with girls and digs his way out of the hole with the help of the gang as they struggle to realise that times have changed. My sympathy with Jim was waning this time, supposedly nine years older and wiser, it is slightly tedious and quite depressing that he fails to cope with the most basic of social situations around the opposite sex and becomes tangled up for the fourth time.By playing on the nostalgia of the series, gags revolving around Jim and his porn stash and footage of his dance and premature ejaculation from the original, the writers are acknowledging that Reunion doesn't hit the highs of previous ones by itself. Although the fact that the audience in the cinema still laughed at these moments suggests the writers are simply giving the viewers what they want.Worth watching, if just to see the cast back together one last time and for Stifler's revenge on Finch."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Awesome!

It still is really really funny all the characters return for a reunion with new characters and new problems for the characters. Very Good full of laughs"}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Going into 'American Reunion' never having seen any of the previous films in the series I can still sense that the franchise is feeling its age. There is a rivalry going on here between sentimentality and raunchiness (raunchiness ends up being the victor most of the time) that don't blend into a consistent tonal whole throughout and, despite these battling factors, 'American Reunion' ends up being rather dramatically lame and kind of unfunny. Seeing these characters act childish and horny might have been funny ten years ago, but watching them at the age of thirty, it's kind of sad. Jason Biggs and Sean William Scott seem willing enough to devote themselves to each crude bit, but the filmmakers are solely interested in having these grown men forced into embarrassing and juvenile situations in which soon after someone catches them in the act. The movie ends up repeating itself so maddeningly often in this fashion. Whatever attempts that are made to stitch on a believable plot attempt to be pushed into the corner by crudity. A reunion that never should have happened."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "American reunion is a ok instalment with nothing to really remember about it. The film is a good inside look at what can happen after everyone settles down and moves on in life, there are some funny moments but nothing like the others. There is no trade mark or line to tell a friend.\r Worth watching once"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "The same old story."}], "recommendations": ["american_pie_2", "american_pie", "coming_2_america", "a_million_ways_to_die_in_the_west", "the_three_stooges", "neighbors_2_sorority_rising", "the_happytime_murders", "the_simpsons_movie", "21_jump_street", "ted_2", "teen_titans_go_to_the_movies", "good_boys", "bad_santa_2", "neighbors", "blended", "the_hangover_part_ii", "think_like_a_man_too", "knocked_up", "night_at_the_museum", "friday", "american_wedding", "step_brothers", "ted", "anchorman_2_the_legend_continues", "superbad"]}
