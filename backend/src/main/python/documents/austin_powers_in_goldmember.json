My family and I enjoyed it very much! The storyline is great. The characters like Mini Me are funny. The humour put into this movie was SO FUNNY for the most part I just could NOT stop laughing, like the molly scene. That was my favourite scene in the movie. Hell, Tokyo even makes an appearence. I've lived there before btw. This movie is awesome and you should totally watch it!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Unconventionally silly, dazzlingly hilarious and packed to the brim with innuendo and a variety of jokes. Gold member is the best out of the trilogy and is one of the funniest movies of all time."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Really great movie. I loved Fat B*****d, Mini Me played a great part when he moved to the good side, Beyonce and of course, Mike Myers. [***SPOILERS***] I loved the fight scene between Mini Me (who wanted to tell Austin he turned to the good side) and Austin! Really recommend this movie!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Austin Powers Goldmember  is one of the funniest f- - -ing movies of all time.

It grabs your attention because of not only the great performances, but also the random comedy. The ending may surprise you."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Weakest of the three in my opinion, but 'Austin Powers in Goldmember' still has some memorable moments.I enjoyed the star-studded and cameo-filled opening scene, it's well done. Mike Myers is again great in his roles, especially Dr. Evil, and Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles is a positive addition. The stuff with Dr. Evil isn't as good as in the 1999 film, yet he still made me laugh a few times; he does have one of the series' best moments with the rendition of the Jay-Z song.However, I did feel a few pacing issues. All in all, it's still worth a watch. As noted, the cameos are solid - and let's just say they chose the perfect actor to play Dr. Evil..."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The third and so far last Austin Power movie. It was neither bad nor did it a poorly performance at the box office but the franchise is now in limbo with rumors that a fourth movie will be made popping up from time to time. I follows the standard formula of the franchise being a parody of James Bond movies with Mike Myers style of humor. For clarification: Mike Myers humor means that it fully depends on how much you like his style of humor. Can be a 1/0 or 10/10. This time we got more insights into the past of the characters, some Goldfinger references, another role for Mike Myers and overall a slightly weaker but still enjoyable movie. The story starts again with Austin Power trying to stop another scheme by Dr. Evil who has allied himself with the Dutch Johan van der Smut called Goldmember (There is a bizarre accident behind the name and lets say he \u201clikes\u201d gold even more than Goldfinger from James Bond). However this time his father who is also a world class spy named Nigel Powers gets involved. The story works for me but does not wow me enough. I think it is the weakest in the franchise but it is nowhere weak enough to being called garbage or bad. The humor works well enough to make this entertaining. By franchise standards it has all sorts from clever jokes, word puns, satire, toilet humor up to some really dirty jokes. Would say >75% work if I had to put numbers on it. Some jokes are not my cup of tea here. For the acting we get a solid performances and a lot of cameos by big names. Mike Myers expanded again with another role. He is Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard (Yes that is his name) and Goldmember. Good performance as always but maybe not as refreshing or original anymore. Michael Caine plays Nigel Powers and does a great job.  Mini Me played by Verne Troyer is again a hidden gem of the movie. Beyonce Knowles does a good performance as Foxxy Cleopatra (Yes this is a jab to James Bond as was it in the prequels). The rest does a good performances and I point out that I liked the set up for a potential fourth movie they teased even if I believe it will ever been green-lighted. Then we have a lot of cameos with some of the big names from Hollywood with Tom Cruise, Steven Spielberg, Danny DeVito, Gwyneth Paltrow, the Osbourne family and Kevin Spacey to just name a few. The rest is the same as before like in the prequels for me. The visuals and effects are nice and the awesome soundtrack is not my cup of tea. Overall I say this is still entertaining but the weakest movie in the franchise. With this it enters the list of franchise without a truly weak entry."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "It's pointless to make such a inane sequel from a unorganized franchise.

However, there's a small matter of what follows after the cold opening.  And that's where this flick seems to fall apart.  Continuing the trend of sexual innuendo (funny during the first two, merely 'filler' in this one) and gross-out scenes (funny during the second movie, but again simply filler in this), this wanders aimlessly trying to make fun of \"Goldfinger\", which I'll admit would be difficult to do even with a decent plan.  I think therein lies the problem...\"Goldfinger\" itself was so over-the-top, it's hard for someone to satirize it to any satisfactory level.  I liked the first two movies, but this entry just left me wondering it Myers and company have finally jumped the sharks (yes...with laser beams on their heads)."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "What happens when the second film in your series outgrosses its predecessor in its opening weekend? Apparently, you run out of ideas and get a little money-hungry. \"Austin Powers in Goldmember\" has no problem recycling jokes from the previous films, but it's still a relatively entertaining film thanks largely to the many performances of Mike Myers.
