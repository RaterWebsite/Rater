Quirky effective humor and jokes, unique interesting characters, an unpredictable plot and that bizarre visual flair. The fact that I can always tell when I'm watching a Wes Anderson movie just by looking at one frame draws me to his work. The Royal Tenenbaums is one of his best, ever second is enjoyable and I cannot even stress how ridiculously entertaining the last 20 minutes is. One of my favorite comedies, worth watching as long as you understand Anderson's type of humor."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Rarely do the elements of detaching quirkiness and heartbreaking drama combine to create such an irresistible product. Of course at the helm is Wes Andersen whose (borderline OCD) meticulous craft completely pays off for the enjoyment of the viewer."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The Royal Tenenbaums is an extremely funny and devastatingly sad movie from Wes Anderson. With superb acting, exquisite timing and an unbelievably brilliant script, The Royal Tenebaums is perfect in every way. If you want to cry yourself to sleep, I have five words for you; \"I've had a rough year.\""}, {"rating": "8", "text": "At first, I wasn't quite sure what to make of The Royal Tenenbaums, but as you gradually get to know the titular weird and wonderful dysfunctional clan, and experience the same trials and tribulations that they do, you truly grow to care for them. As always with Wes Anderson's films it's beautifully written, and simple but striking in its visual style. A brilliantly talented ensemble cast perform for your pleasure, and Gene Hackman is simply mesmerising as the complex Tenenbaum patriarch who is far more than another distant father - he's a real puzzle-box of a character whose layers are gradually pealed back as the narrative progresses. Gwyneth Paltrow and Luke Wilson also stand out as the severely depressed adopted daughter and the youngest son who has drifted aimlessly through life since his career as a professional tennis player floundered. The title cards used between narrative segments of the film, presented like chapters of a novel are a little irritating, and tend to break up the flow of the story rather than link this tale to storytelling tropes of classic literature, as was likely the intention. This is a minor gripe though, and The Royal Tenenbaums remains an engrossing, darkly comic tale of short-lived successes and persistent failures, love and hate, joy and depression, and above all else, family."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I'm actually surprised by the user reviews of this film. This film hits all the right spots. Along with Rushmore, Wes Anderson has already created the new foundation for future comedy-dramas in just his first few films. I'm willing to debate that what Anderson has done for the \"dramedy\" is similar to what Martin Scorsese did for the crime drama. In tone and pace (not to mention their use of camera techniques), their work will be copied for decades to come. The Royal Tenenbaums is hilarious, heartbreaking, and if you're paying attention, filled with emotion of all corners. Great ensemble cast, great narration by Alec Baldwin, and for those who call it off-beat, I question your rhythm. Gene Hackman delivers his finest performance to date. The best film of 2001, possibly the decade, and my favorite film of all time."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I have found that this movie polarizes people into two camps. You are either going to hate it or love it. I personally think that it is one of the greatest movies ever made, but I like everything that Wes Anderson has directed. It has one of the most amazing casts that has ever been assembled, and every actor shines in his/her own unique way in this movie. If you are looking for a laugh out loud comedy that is filled to the brim with sex, farts, and genitals than this is definitely not the movie for you. If, however, you are looking for a subtly funny, and deeply moving movie that has the ability to stay with you for years to come than I recommend this movie to you.Side note- I don't know what it is exactly, but I am totally in love with Margot Tenenbaum. Maybe it is her wooden ring finger. Perhaps it is her black eyeliner. Maybe it is because she never really smiles. It's weird. She is so not my type, but I just want to . . .Anyways. Check this one out."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Wes Anderson is truly on display here. The quirkiness of this family certainly shines through with great acting from the whole cast.

It is a masterpiece by writer and director Wes Anderson, and arguably his best film. The trials and tribulations of the Tennenbaum family will have you rolling with laughter one moment and weeping with despair at the next. Somehow this movie seamlessly blends the highest comedy and lowest tragedy. I watch this movie at least once a year.

This is my favorite movie and it deserves to be worshiped."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This is my favourite Wes Anderson movie, the story telling, cast and everything come together perfectly.

Wes Anderson is one of my favorite directors. His movies are unlike any others. His movies have countless good qualities, but what stands out in this movie are the characters and the complex relationships between these characters. The characters pop off the screen and into real life like magic in that special kind of way that makes me love movies. There are countless intricate and amazing relationships in this movie like Margot and Richie's who are in love but related (not by blood). Or even like the small but hilarious relationship between Raleigh st Clair and Dudley who has a rare learning disability. However my favorite is the relationship between Chas and Royal, that royal has ruined and is able to mend it through time, and saving the thing Chas loves most in the world (his two boys). Royal is able to mend this relationship and in the end chas loves him again and this is beautiful. Royal accomplished what he wanted to do all along, and make it right and earn the love of his children again."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Truly Wes Anderson's masterpiece.

There are a couple funny moments, and a couple emotionally affecting ones, but the cast is wasted.  I didn't mind the characters so much as the way they're used.  Wilson's and Stiller's characters are funny, but they almost never get a chance to steal the show.  I also had a problem with the one character falling in love with his adopted sister.  Maybe not actual incest but still weird and uncomfortable.  It could have been so much better but Anderson's need for meticulousness completely distracts from the story and not in a good way.  I wouldn't call myself either a Wes Anderson fan or hater.  Some of his work, like The Grand Budapest Hotel, I really like, and other times it just doesn't.  This was one of those times it just didn't do anything for me.  I'll eventually re-watch this, and maybe I'll come back with a different opinion, but for now it's a meh for me."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Family comedy drama.

Anyone who found this nonsense funny really needs to get out and get a life. This film was utter dross from beginning to end and a total waste of Gene Hackman and the rest of the cast looked really bored all the way through.  Wes Anderson has no sense of humour, no talent and should go back to commercials.

Packed with some solid stars (both comedic and straight-laced), 'The Royal Tenenbaums' is a delightful and much slanted look at the coessential dysfunctional family that could be from Anywhere, USA. Well, actually it could be from anywhere in the galaxy as you may not come across a more strange slew of characters in one place anywhere on God's green earth. For openers, Gene Hackman plays a hysterical deadbeat dad who had been alienated by the rest of his bizarre family for ignorance to them and vulgarity to others which can include even us the audience. Yet at the same time the viewer will be sympathetic to him and his mischievous routine and rebellious nature given his sly warmheartedness and charm. The trio of the children's life stories (wild and wholly tales portrayed in retrospect and real-time by Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow & Luke Wilson) surround this rude and complex father shortcomings in spectacular fashion while combative yet dignified mom played by Angelica Houston is a steady presence amongst the chaos. Owen Wilson and Bill Murray round out the supporting cast for this fun-filled comedy.

Dont expect the usual Ben Stiller/Owen Wilson esc comedy, because you wont find it here. That in no way makes it a bad film because the press misinformed people about it's true genre. Life Aquatic is the same, its subtle humor, the result of performances with depth and a director unbelievably good considering his relative inexperience. Wes Anderson is becoming a rule onto himself, creating a portfolio of work that is pushed under the title \"Comedy\", but is really just an Anderson movie.

The moment I realized that I would get to see Gene Hackman, the baddest badass of the 80s and 90s, in a Wes Anderson probably with all its silly and odd quirks and ridiculous storyline to back that up, I was all in for it. As a pleasant surprise, this movie didn't disappoint. In fact, I would go so far as to disagree with general ratings and it is a 9+ sorta film and it is a probably a top 3 amongst Wes Anderson films.Ben Stiller is perhaps the most underwhelming of the cast since he didn't much to do beyond wearing the red jumpsuit. Danny Glover (unrelated to Donald of the same namesake and Atlanta Fame) is a subdued presence whose flying off the handle during an rude and hysterical altercation with Royal is the moment of the whole movie. Wilson brothers are delightful but Owen definitely is the better performer, his speech a perfect setup for his line to resonate on your funny-bones. Honestly though, no one could possibly be as hilarious as Angelica Huston who always seem like she is about to crack into a grin but keeps going on with straight non-hilarious things. She is only next to Ralph Fiennes (The Grand Budapest Hotel) and Bruce Willis (Moonlight Paradise) in terms of hilarious factors. And as a Gwyneth Paltrow is the perfect fit as the adopted daughter with upmteen secrets. Definitely the best Wes Anderson movie cast ever and even if the story goes soft at times, the same can't be said of the presentation by the actors. Do watch it before you die, or you will regret not having streaming services in The Afterlife (if it exist, that is)."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "enriching into a cathartic release..The Royal TenenbaumsThe symmetric world and the camera work has always been the maker's signature that lures in the audience through its stunning visuals and pleasingly light and breezy tone of the feature; contradict to its premise. As mentioned, it is rich on such technical aspects like costume design and cinematography but is short on sound department. Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson; the screenwriters, has done an excellent work on offering concrete material that is flat out hilarious and keeps the audience engaged where no one can defy that he or she isn't entertained. Wes Anderson; the director, as always, is excellent in his work on execution and the primary reason it always works is his awareness of the vision that he wishes to implement on screen. The performance is of course, amazingly done because of such a great cast especially Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Gwyneth Paltrow and Gene Hackman. The only minor conflict in here, is that the material hits on screen all together and offers very little time to breathe to the audience which can be off putting at times.
