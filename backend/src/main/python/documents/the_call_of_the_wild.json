Not only did we enjoy it,but we all loved it. It's obviously geared toward being a family film and steered away from some of the darker moments of Jack London's classic, but if you've read the book, its stays close enough that you can fill in the blanks yourself and still enjoy the movie with your kids."

First, we watch the protagonist pooch get kidnapped and transported to Gold Rush Alaska, where he's conscripted into a sled dog team to deliver the mail. None of this matters because the script is so excessively precious and corny. Making matters SO much worse is the horribly computerized canine creation. Not only do they anthropomorphize him to an absurd degree, but they have him doing things that no dog could ever intuit, much less perform. I'd say the scenery is beautiful, but not sure how much of that is computer generated either. Children (who can be less discriminating) will probably enjoy the oversized emotions, minimal grittiness and sweet canine star, but author of the novel Jack London must be rolling over\u2026and I mean that as a dog trick."

I often found myself forgetting that they weren't real. I had heard it was a kid's movie, and yet the full theater at 4:30 on a Friday had not one kid, but instead was adults between 50-80 years old. I suspect they were there because they had read the book when they were young. Afterwards from what I overheard, the older folks really liked the film. Scenery was beautiful and time-period sets were well crafted. My only disappointment was that Harrison Ford's character didn't have much screen time until the second half of the film. My wife had a hard seeing any cruelty towards the dogs (which was minimal). Overall a great movie. Thanks to all who made it!"

This is an attempt to turn an unflinchingly bleak and austere novel from the early twentieth century into a children's film for the year 2020. The results are astoundingly complex in quality, and not in a particularly good way. The best way I can put is thus; the first 45 minutes of this movie are obnoxious and silly beyond repair, and the last 45 minutes are much more focused and emotionally resonant. There's an honest-to-God night and day difference between the two halves. First, you're witnessing a ludicrous, barely-of-this-reality-looking canine emoting for dear life against CGI backdrop after CGI backdrop, complete with slapstick and anthropomorphisms galore. Then, we end with a plaintive, melancholy meditation on life, death and the cruel reality of nature, featuring a much less cartoonish-acting -- and, thus much more palatable-looking -- doggo at the center. It's infuriating how much better the second half of this movie is than the first. So goes yet another film to toss into the \"Tale Of Two Movies\" case file."

And unfortunately, I really don't have much to say on this one other than its story feels very loosely-structured in comparison to the novel, and I've always felt as though a film can focus strictly on animals rather than humans for only so long before becoming a bit tedious. In addition, every single dog in this film is very painfully obviously CGI, which didn't sit too well with me. The bond between Ford and the main dog was endearing at times, and there are some cool shots and scenes throughout, but none of it's really enough to make the rest of the film worthwhile."

From the trailer it was instantly clear the dog is not real and it's a problem even if many viewers don't outright realize it, they'll sense it (it does push the envelope technically and soon you won't be able to tell).  Ford is as usual completely convincing.  As legendary a mega star and great actor as he is, somehow he's still under-rated.

      "text": "The 20th Century Studios logo, compared to Buck (in terms of VFX), is horrifying. Still hard to believe Disney wanted to chunk Fox off their logos to get \"mooarrr companyyyysss\".Well, uhh... Congrats to Chris Sanders. He may be the only director I know who successfully translated from Animation (with stuff like Lilo & Stich and The Croods) to Live-Action since...I don't know, Henry Selick? (remember Monkeybone?)Because, while it has his problems, The Call Of The Wild so much feels like it wants to become an epic while it's surrounded by the \"Kids Movie\" territory that blocks it from reaching its full potential, especially when it has moments of interchangeable pacing that feel hollow or random at times.An epic that features a CG Dog that may bother a lot of the Audience (it didn't to me), but at the same time resonate WITH the Audience, thanks to the fact that it's essentially a Dog hybrid of Forrest Gump and Cast Away...oh, and it has Harrison Ford narrating too.And it's not that Buck bothered me because it was everything else that was bothering me. Either the rest of the animals is CG, there's a colossal waste of Karen Gillian (who's in it just as much as a Stan Lee cameo in an MCU Flick) and a rather bizarre and cartoonish plot point in the 3rd Act.But again, it's all salvaged by the journey of Buck, which is fueled by a nice message about \"finding your place in the world\" and the fact that A-listers like Harrison Ford and Omar Sy are there to carry the movie \"somewhere\", since a major part of the movie is just stuff happening for no reason (despite knowing the mission of selected part).Not only that but also the fact that Dan Stevens plays more of a beast in here than the actual Beast in the Beauty And The Beast remake, playing this selfish, idiotic Circus(?) leader who hates everything but that sweet sweet gold.So yeah, I liked The Call Of The Wild, and while I'm sure you won't love it or something (the Box Office speaks for itself), at least you can't deny that it had a story and a really good one at that."

      "text": "The Call of the Wild is a strange film. All the pieces for a great movie are here but the studio or Director choose to be lazy instead of taking advantage of the opportunity. If you have seen any clips or trailers from this film then you know that they animated a dog instead of using a real dog. It\u2019s not just the dog they created in CGI. They did it to every single animal. It\u2019s incredibly lazy and distracting. It\u2019s not that the animals look bad, it's just uncanny. It looks like a dog and acts like a dog but it doesn\u2019t feel like a dog. At certain points within the film, the dog will make \u201chuman expressions\u201d. It feels out of place. The movie feels like it honestly should have been animated. I would have really liked this movie if it had been animated but I wouldn\u2019t have loved it. The film still has issues in the character and editing category. Most of the characters in the film were pretty good such as Harrison Ford and  Omar Sy but Dan Stevens' performance and character/villain was pretty awful. His performance was so over the top that it was distracting. I normally like over the top performances but this wasn\u2019t the kind of over the top I like. His character was pretty awful too. He is supposed to be the main antagonist but he is only in the film for about 5 minutes. He feels more like a plot device than a character. While Steven\u2019s character is pretty bad, Ford and Sy\u2019s characters were pretty good. Both of their characters were fleshed out and were very likeable. Their performances added to this likeability. Harrison Ford did a great job. I honestly felt that this is one of his better performances in a long time. He brought a lot of depth and vulnerability to his performance and made his character relatable and interesting. Omar Sy did a pretty good job. His performance wasn\u2019t on the same level as Ford\u2019s but he still was enjoyable to see on screen. The plot of the film and its sequence of events was surprisingly really well done and emotional. The film is fast paced all the way through and the film is able to successfully deliver emotional punches with the human characters but not for the CGI animals. The only issue I took with the structure and sequence of events was how the second half of the film was much better than the first half. The first half of the film has good performances but the plot hasn\u2019t fully kicked into gear yet so it\u2019s not as interesting. The second half is when Harrison Ford comes in and the film becomes much much better. Most of the film\u2019s technical aspects were pretty good too. The cinematography was pretty good for the most part but did have some beautiful establishing shots. The score by John Powell was great and helped add some emotion to certain scenes but the editing wasn\u2019t that great. It wasn\u2019t terrible but it was noticeably awkward when it transitioned to other scenes. Overall, The Call of the Wild has all the pieces to make a good film but decides to take the lazy route and animate all the animals muting some of the emotional weight."

Um deles, que era o lider e chamava aten\u00e7\u00e3o, some e nem se quer retorna ao filme, o que \u00e9 um erro visto o potencial que ele tinha. Em um momento da trama, os cachorros somem, e nenhuma import\u00e2ncia \u00e9 dada a isso. Ficamos sem respostas e o roteiro demonstra se importar apenas com o cachorro de bom cora\u00e7\u00e3o, como ele fosse o suficiente e cobrisse a lacuna de todos os personagens. Isso deixa o filme superficial demais, fazendo com que n\u00e3o haja nenhum apelo dram\u00e1tico e que tenhamos a sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de que o roteiro \u00e9 unidimensional. \u00c9 frustrante, pois tudo caminhava muito bem at\u00e9 que o casal dos correios fosse embora. Tudo desanda a partir dali.Quanto a CGI, apesar de n\u00e3o conseguir passar a sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de um animal de verdade, ao menos n\u00e3o no protagonista, \u00e9 convincente na maioria das vezes e aqui h\u00e1 um bom trabalho nas express\u00f5es faciais, que eu particularmente achei mais atraente que a do Rei Le\u00e3o Remake. Os cen\u00e1rios s\u00e3o absolutamente lindos, e a fotografia aproveita muito bem disso e entrega planos bel\u00edssimos de bem estruturados.Call of the Wild \u00e9 um filme lindo, mas que se perde com o tempo e se contenta com o que foi apresentado e descartado, fazendo com que o desenvolvimento ficasse todo em torno do Buck, anulando qualquer aparente \"universo\" que poderia haver."

The main protagonist of the film is Buck, a CGI canine that is funny and quirky enough as we see him grow into the leader and alpha dog he needed to be. The plot of the film is nothing new or clever but has plenty of fun interactions of more CGI dogs that is just enough to make this film passable. Harrison Ford gives a good performance for the minimal screen time he is given. The movie never really shows us why the story of Buck had to really happen it all just kind of does as well as Ford's character has some background but not enough to satisfy his arc.

      "text": "*Majestic wolf howls in the background* Welcome back to Stream To Big Screen! This week we were able to review the new version of the often adapted Jack London classic, The Call of the Wild. If you haven't read the book in a while or just don't remember, the book is about a dog named Buck who against all odds makes it through the roughest parts of the Yukon to find his true calling in the wild (skipping a bunch of key part and oversimplifying).Now, let's get this straight. THIS MOVIE DOES NOT FOLLOW THE BOOK! DO NOT TAKE YOUR CHILD TO SEE THIS MOVIE INSTEAD OF THEM READING THE BOOK. THEY WILL GET A \"C-\" AT BEST. THEY WILL HAVE THE GIST OF THE BOOK BUT NOT THE CORRECT DETAILS. Now let's get to the review of this movie.Twentieth Century Fox Animation and Twentieth Century Fox brought us this latest version and I must say as far as animation goes, it was the star. The film looks bright and crisp. The scenery is quite immersive. I almost know what it feels like to actually ride on a dog sled. Speaking of dog sleds, the animation with the dogs is sometimey. I'll admit most of the time the animation portrays the dog's emotions and expressions flawlessly. The other part of the time I feel like I'm watching a cartoon, a la Garfield, Scooby Doo animation. Quite frankly, it's off-putting. I wanted to forget that I was watching CGI creatures but the quality of these effects just kept on reminding me (I'm looking at you mystic wolf). Now, this same aspect I'm sure kids wouldn't even mind.Kids also won't mind that this movie is almost too light. This book has some very heavy scenes and themes but this movie approached those same concepts in the lightest way possible. The PG rating handcuffed the producers almost too much. I understand they were producing this for a younger audience, but they may have gone too light for this classic. The PG rating definitely influenced how closely this movie could come to the true spirit the literary piece of work.Long story short, The Call of the Wild is an American middle school reading classic adapted to the big screen a few times. This movie has been updated with all the dog-loving CGI you can handle. This movie will be perfect for the classroom for kids but just worth a matinee visit for the family to the theater."
