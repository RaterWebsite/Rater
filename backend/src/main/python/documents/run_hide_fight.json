The movie took a huge risk to create a story surrounding the topics it did, and completely hit a home run.  I haven\u2019t rooted for a main character like that since watching Lord of The Rings for the first time. Well done."

There are a couple of issues I found that did not help, for instance the parts where the mom came are not verry good. Some of the acting is not all ways on point, and the villains lack in character development. Overall 81/100"

Zoe Hull (Isabel May) is a badass, but doesn't shove feminism in your face. She's got issues & isn't doing too well. I didn't see this movie as a conservative or 2A flick. Just a darn good action film. I found my fist repeatedly flying in the air, & \"Eff Yeah!\" escaping my mouth.We can all have the hard choice to Run, Hide, or Fight."

While it does subtly promote 2nd Amendment rights, it never really goes beyond that. A lot of suspense, and I was biting my nails the whole time. The ending is a bit iffy but the movie as a whole is raelly great."

Zoe, the main character caught against all odds to save her entire school, she was exceptional, and the daily wire is amazing for publishing this exceptional movie. I was lucky to catch the free screening on youtube for the release and it brought me through the ride of my life. This movie invoked some real sadness touching upon zoes relatio ship with her deceased mother from the intro, and as the story progressed it built up to the heroism which I felt she portrayed perfectly. 10/10 for such a fantastic movie."

I think the only reason that some reviewers don't like it is that it has a pro-gun message. There is so much woke messaging in Hollywood these days (on purpose) it's good to see a movie that doesn't do that. I enjoyed it, and so did most real viewers, Hollywood critics be damned."

That has nothing to do with the quality of the movie.This film is hard to watch, given the subject matter.  Especially since it doesn\u2019t pull any punches.  But man does it draw you in, keep you on the edge of your seat, make you root for each and every good guy and neutral party, make you desperately want to see the main bad guy fail, and leave you wanting more.  It\u2019s also not quite as unrealistic as some people say.  Individuals do go up against violent offenders.  Some people are willing to risk themselves to save others, if the opportunity to overcome is presented.  This movie makes you think of those people.I\u2019m not surprised by the poor critic ratings...or the glowing viewer ratings.  It\u2019s seriously amazing, and I can\u2019t wait to see what these guys come out with next."

It was equal parts action and emotion, making you feel a wide variety of things from happiness and relief to hopelessness and fear. The main actress who plays Zoe is fantastic, she is truly a talented artist that captures you and brings you into her world. It was also the perfect length, not too long and just right to portray the story. I have never seen a movie like this before and it really made me think about our future. This movie brings up so many topics of conversation about our school system and the protection of our children while under their care. It got my husband and I talking about it after. Give it a watch with an open mind. It's graphic but very realistic."

And the plot, as well as the action, made the 1hr and 45 min fly by. I\u2019ll admit, lately I\u2019ve struggled to get through movies without falling asleep (odd for me to admit in a review).

      "text": "For the Daily Wire's first entrance into the entertainment industry, this is a surprisingly good film. The stated purpose of this movie is to provide entertainment to compete with Hollywood so that all of the entertainment you get doesn't come from people who have absolute disdain for middle America.As such, they wisely sidestep the preaching and the social cliches in favor of engaging characters, excellent performances, and an attempt to foster independent thought and discussion about the real-world conventions here. My only nitpick is that the ending is a tad anti-climactic, but the build-up throughout the movie kept me on the edge of my seat, and seeing the way students and teachers responded really hit hard at a few points.The Hollywood critics, of course, despise it because they can't handle competition either in the entertainment business or in political beliefs, but don't blindly take their word for it. See the movie for yourself and decide whether this kind of competition is worth supporting. If nothing else, it will definitely keep you entertained."

I would pit this movie against any of the other thrillers out right now, or recently released.This movie also exposes some of the problems with most school systems' standard protocol in response to emergency situations to this day, which I find to be valuable conversation-starters.I hope to see more movies like this come out in the near future."

      "text": "This is an adult, intense movie that probably shouldn\u2019t be viewed by anyone under the age of 16, and for the 16-18 year olds it should be viewed only if they are mature and accompanied with a serious discussion with the parents.  The movie certainly isn\u2019t perfect: it at times stretches credulity and some of the writing is a bit fake.  However, it is still a very engaging and emotionally compelling movie.The story centers on a school shooting from the perspective of one of the victims.  This makes for an uncompromisingly intense experience right through to the end.  May is spectacular in her role, which is demanding and emotionally deep. Each of the young adult/child actors does an incredible job in this film in making you believe, and understand, what they\u2019re going through...even those playing the villains, all but one who is fleshed out.  As I wrote above, the movie has flaws, but it is surprising to see the critics hate this movie as much as they do.  The best I can figure, they hate the movie not because of its artistic statement or the craft in the work, but because the writer/director has made some movies with politically right leaning values and one producer has been accused of sexually assaulting a 16-year old.  Despite being distributed by the right wing media company The Daily Wire, the movie is not political in any way.  It can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their political beliefs because the movie doesn\u2019t preach or force or even make any political statements.  It is merely a compelling story of a culturally relevant topic.  The biggest difficulty for someone looking to legally watch this movie in North America is that it does require a subscription to The Daily Wire, a right wing media outlet owned and created by the controversial Ben Shapiro.  The movie will not be enough to entice politically apathetic or liberal minded people to join.  But if you are conservative, libertarian, or a free thinker and interested in politics, the movie might be good enough for you to sign up for a trial run and see if there is anything else on the site which interests you."
