      "text": "Ninety minutes of total tedium. Laurence Fishburne has become the actor directors turn to if they can't afford Samuel Jackson. Director Adam Alleca (who is also responsible for writing this rubbish) has managed to make a film that is even more badly written than his vile screenplay for the remake of \"Last House On The Left\"."

      "text": "It's a pity that anything that has a hint of religiosity is killed by critics.  This movie despite the poor reviews was actually pretty good.  the performances were solid as Thos. Janes portrays an interrupted suicide and Larry Fishbourne, using his native Georgian accent, an interrupted hired killer.  Sometimes interruptions work out well; and sometimes you should just let it go and move on, but it's hard to tell which in the beginning.  We enjoyed it.  Music was horrible."
