My score could not be other than 5.The movie has Blomkamp signature: fast yet clever, good characters with enough development, that forces you to ride with the movie to get the whole scenario, and this was incredibly awesome. I think this was the first movie this year i cared about the characters, \"good and evil\", if there are any. But at the same time it gets so cheesy and vain that you can't believe it's the same movie."

Beautiful character design, eclectic performances and a thoroughly engaging storyline made for an excellent experience. Knowing Die Antwoord prior to this really helped, and I'd anticipate that audiences unfamiliar with them may find them, and the South African subtext, unsettling and somewhat difficult stylistically. Some truly poignant moments are interspersed with a delightful humour and, though some of the themic content needed more care, this is another unique exploration of the nature of humanity and the soul dealt with in a playful, rather than sombre, fashion. The dialogue was occasionally weak, bordering on charicature, and the cinematography was generally well executed. Overall this was a fast paced, sometimes poignant and always engaging experience. 8.11/10"

      "text": "I don't get the negative press, I really don't. This movie's take on AI isn't exactly the most scientifically accurate portrayal, but as a fun popcorn movie, Chappie takes a little bit of cerebral, a larger bit of Neill Blomkamp action, and a lot of South African weirdness. If you're expecting just a cameo from South African rappers Die Antwoord, you're wrong. They're surprisingly in focus.\r There are more than a few plot holes and writing mistakes, but it's largely made up for by how compelling the on-screen reality is. Neill Blomkamp directed the heck out of this movie. If he ever gets a really brilliant script, he'll make a great movie. As a writer, he's too eager to please a crowd and not eager enough to answer its questions.\r Given how hard it reportedly was to make a film with non-actors, this may be the only Die Antwoord sci-fi action thriller we ever see. However, they are impossible to duplicate, and the sheer absurdity of watching them prance around unironically in skimpy Americana, juxtaposed against an entirely convincing emancipated police robot learning to think, makes the movie work. It isn't quite as exciting as District 9, but it's far less ponderous and heavy-handed than Elysium. Go watch it and have some fun."

      "text": "Neill Blomkamp successfully blends the aural & visual wizardry of Elysium with the scrappy charm & smart storytelling of District 9 in his third feature-length film, \"Chappie\", which starts off like a South African spin on 1980's sci-fi, but then diverts from the pack and becomes its own thinking and feeling beast. Blomkamp's signature blend of raw violence and human sentiment is still on display throughout, but is more potent here since the director (and his wife Terri Tatchell) focus purely on the struggle between children and adults, and the hardships that come with growing up. The film also doubles as a tight, compelling meditation on what it really means to be alive. I think the critics missed the ball here.\r The title character, voiced and performed by Sharlto Copley, is fully realized. He gives the film a beating heart, and brings real-world human qualities and actual depth to an otherwise mechanical figure. I'd like to see Copley get some more quality roles in the movies. His maker, played by Dev Patel, isn't as well developed, but is no less compelling. Hugh Jackman from the X-Men films relishes the opportunity to play the villain, a roboticist skeptical of artificial intelligence. He is a hoot to watch, partially because of his mullet and the fact he's completely over-the-top. The real surprise here is rap group Die Antwoord as a pair of criminals who fight with Patel's character over how to raise Chappie. While their acting is rough around the edges, they help give the film a unique charm, adding wit and flavor to the gritty proceedings. Their scenes together provide commentary on dysfunctional families. The only weak link in this ensemble is Sigourney Weaver, sadly (as the CEO of the robot factory), since her role is basically a glorified cameo.\r Overall, \"Chappie\" is fresh, ballsy, confident and very entertaining (sorry, Divergent!). Blomkamp, with three winners in a row now, is at the top of the modern action movie throne. He is one of the very few people I trust when it comes to blockbusters, and his films are definitive evidence."

I enjoyed watching Chappie develop as a character throughout the movie and its hard not to be interested in him as such an innocent form of artificial intelligence. I thought there were some pretty good performances in here. Dev Patel is pretty good and its pretty hard to criticise Hugh Jackman either, its a nice change to see him as the villain. Still Sigourney Weaver was very underused and Ninja the South African rapper hogged a lot of the screen time acting like an idiot and trying to promote his band Die Antwood. I found Ninja incredibly annoying at points and I hope we don't see him again in any major role. Other than that I enjoyed the action that Chappie had to offer and I think that if you are a fan of Blomkamp's other films you will likely enjoy this one."

Every bit as good as any action film made in the last few years, including the Avengers.  But I take it for what it is.  It isn't supposed to be the next AI.  It is meant to be an engaging movie more along the lines of a cross between Robocop and Short Circuit.  Too many film critics have compare-it-itis.  They want every film to be better than the last.  They want deep thought-provoking transcendent films and anything that takes the risk of just being enjoyable gets hammered for it.  Chappie is not brilliant  but it is a mix of adulthood and childhood and innocence and violence that allows it to stand on its own as an honestly enjoyable film."

If you go in hoping to see a fun (and funny) popcorn movie with fantastic visuals, entertaining performances and some softly-delivered social messaging, then this is a perfectly good way to spend two hours. I'm really bothered by the criticism of Neil Blomkamp for supposedly becoming \"M. Night Shyamalan 2.0\". Just let the man make his weird movies. His vision is fresh and his movies are well crafted. Giving  rappers Die Antwoord (Ninja and Yo-Landi) major roles was a big risk that mostly paid off in the final scenes (and reinforced the distinctly South African feel of the movie). My advice? Ignore the haters and relax. \"Chappie\" might be a spiritual successor to \"Short Circuit,\" but it actually has a soul. That's no small feat in today's studio scene."

But, this movie ends with a normal ending. when Deon got hurts, Chappie, as a robot shows humanity and try to save him while his battery was going to over. By my opinion, the end of the movie can be better if the director presents that Deon stay wounded and when polices enters into the hall Chappie's battery would down and it would be dead. Because, the human brain can never be transmitted, i believe, death can never be ignored. But, the movie shows that with the  neurotransmitter helmet human consciousness can be transferred to a new body which is totally impossible and unbelievable.\rOver all, the movie grows up very well. One can learn bad sides of arrogance, not to stop in front of your dream from the movie. Deon's perseverance is quite impressive. But seriously speaking, It could be my most favorite movie if it ends in an unexpected way not showing that with science one can ignore death.\rThank you, Neill Blomkamp for a beautiful movie."

What I like so much about CHAPPIE is that the movie is a take on a precise vision on artificial intelligence and what massive dangers go along. Maybe my personal interests, hopes and worries are distracting me but what can be seen at this piece of cinematic creation should not just be handled without care, as machines can potentially become a real thread to humans one day, so this movie moral currently seems quite underated. However the philosophy, even the movie itself is interesting and exciting most the time. I dislike the main conflict, as it is nothing new and especially not exciting at all, but for me following the story of an inhuman child was very fascinating. The story has certain points giving you a feeling of unsafety and other where the viewer will be asured for something good to happen soon, as he/she will learn to somehow get in touch with CHAPPIE himself/herself and after being done watching this movie it will stay in your thoughts for a long amount of time, at least that happened to me. The general elaboration is very actionish, basically this film is shootings, violence and some plot in between. Even though I am usually opposed to that themes, it didn't quite disturb me as for CHAPPIE, where the situation of some kind of mental war was enforced to that showing of direct power. Overall I really enjoyed CHAPPIE and I can not say often enough that this movie was to rule my thoughts and still has influence on how I think about robotic technology, as how I see it the backgrounds of the movie are not as groundless as they might think at first and the visual content appears quite dystopic, but yet somewhat plausible and that's what fascinated me the most about that movie, I do really recommend to fans of Science fiction."

Because despite the many, many critics firing at it to its post-apocalyptic hell and back\u2014specifically targeting director Neill Blomkamp\u2019s 2009 commercial and critical breakthrough District 9, calling his success a \u201cfluke\u201d after 2013\u2019s disappointing Elysium and considering him a \u201cone-hit wonder\u201d among the sci-fi genre\u2014I, however, found Chappie to be both conceptually and visually involving when it wasn\u2019t balancing on a tightrope between Chappie\u2019s Short Circuit\u2019s innocence-meets-Iron Giant\u2019s naivety and the \u201cgangsta\u201d glorification or glamorization of their respective stereotypes. It\u2019s one of the rare occasions where the R rating felt quite restrictive and main protagonist Chappie\u2019s awe-inspiring lightheartedness and the supporting characters\u2019 vulgarity and ugliness and the film\u2019s gritty nature crossover in what appears to be Blomkamp\u2019s identity crisis of whether he wants his \u201880s sci-fi influences to tug audiences at the heartstrings or the attention span.\r As you can tell from the \u201cawe-inspiring\u201d comment, maybe I\u2019m of the minority that found Chappie\u2019s childlike nature both charming and, dare I say, cute as a former police bot could be. It\u2019s a bit frustrating when I hear film critics call adolescent characters in any film \u201cannoying\u201d based on, let\u2019s say in Chappie\u2019s case, their immature, inquisitive, or at certain scenes, whiny qualities. Because aren\u2019t all children annoying because of their wondrous behavior? I could\u2019ve understood these criticisms if I didn\u2019t let out so many damn \u2018awe\u2019s at Chappie\u2019s dialogue; from Chappie\u2019s use of \u201cmommy\u201d and \u201cdaddy\u201d\u2014both [spoiler]    referring to the South African rave-rap duo Die Antwoord, ok\u2014to the take-it-or-leave-it \u201cf***-mother!\u201d to the questions that even bask in the back of our minds from time to time regarding our own existence (\u201cWhy did you make me so I would die?\u201d). The supporting characters\u2014Chappie\u2019s good-natured AI creator and the oppositely-natured Die Antwoord respectively\u2014are all there, ready to adopt the bot for their own selfish moral desires, which is engaging entertainment in its own right once you see Chappie\u2019s rapid character growth due to their influences all-in-one. But it\u2019s as if the human characters themselves experience frequent and unusual personality malfunctions throughout Chappie\u2019s two-hour duration, where DA\u2019s Yo-Landi even becomes more nurturing than the creator.\r Besides the narrative shortcomings, philosophical and political undertones also make their way into Chappie in typical Blomkamp style, where we are not once explicitly aware of what he\u2019s actually trying to say outside of obvious topics\u2014such as the state of consciousness and how far it may or may not expand beyond that of current common knowledge, not that 2013\u2019s Her didn\u2019t already quite commendably confront that\u2014and AI\u2014already. Because let\u2019s face it, Blomkamp just can\u2019t take a breather when it comes to the film\u2019s overabundance of action sequences. The $50 million budget definitely results in some visually striking imagery and the South African setting feels original in an era where everything in cinema is happening in either America or Europe nowadays. But couldn\u2019t we get at least a hint that the storyline can progress itself without the need of guns, explosions, ultraviolence toward the third act, and more and more explosions. As if its identity crisis couldn\u2019t have been distracting enough regarding its moral stance and aforementioned change in tone.\r But as much as I could nitpick Chappie for simply not being District 9\u2019s much, much more successful storytelling, I\u2019d be a damned liar if I said I didn\u2019t feel enchanted or engulfed at least once throughout its desperation of wondering what Short Circuit would be like if it existed in the RoboCop universe. If I was ambivalent at certain moments, I began to see the inspiration start to sneak through the tiniest bits of dialogue or visual sequences, particularly those involving Chappie himself. It\u2019s an excellent concept that merely needed a longer lifespan during the developmental process, perhaps if Blomkamp wasn\u2019t so anxious to direct the next Alien sequel\u2014but, I mean, who wouldn\u2019t be? After reading online into many professional\u2019s reportedly slim expectations regarding its fulfillment of its half-of-a-hundred million dollar budget, I\u2019ll be even more disappointed if Chappie doesn\u2019t at least garner a cult following just so I can hope for the slightest chance that Blomkamp\u2014or another director, if so many others don\u2019t find him fit enough\u2014to reintroduce us into this universe, whether it\u2019s in the form of a sequel or perhaps even a reboot in the distant, distance future. Please!\r Overall rating: 7.1\r P.S., without revealing any major SPOILERS, one of the scenes has Chappie in his childlike form receiving quite a bit of physical and emotional abuse and has received negative reactions from former victims of child abuse, saying it triggered painful memories. A warning, I suppose."

One of them has even quoted \u201cI haven't been as happy to see a movie end since the third Transformers.\u201d\r Are you kidding me? It was a blast and this film keeps you engaged throughout the film. There\u2019s never a boring moment. I\u2019ve read most of the reviews and they only have a very few valid points. There are things like how Jackman pins Dev Patel with a gun in office without anyone saying anything or how gangsters let their kidnapping victim come and go. Yes, these are some screenwriting concerns which makes the experience unreasonable at times. But it\u2019s still a breezy script and the action moves along without having a dull moment. Trust me, most of the reviews are just wild rants and people conforming to peer pressure. I\u2019ll take down their points one by one.\r This film has been heavily criticized for its derivativeness, especially with its links to Robocop. But hey, there\u2019s nothing original in art, and art is all about referencing other art forms. Also, original may be uninteresting and boring. On the contrary, this film is refreshing new especially the way he combined old references to create something unique. Much like Tarantino, he took it to a whole new level of existential philosophy and action. In fact, it\u2019s way better than any Robocop sequels ever made.\r Now, an annoying Chappie seems to have bothered many. But hey, wasn\u2019t Chappie was just as fun like being with a child. And, making it behave like a child must include a little annoyance. It makes it cute and realistic. No wonder Yolandi\u2019s motherly instincts kicked in so well. If anyone thinks that an annoying child is a bad thing then they should check with their psychiatrist immediately.\r Yes, the acting wasn\u2019t great like Birdman but it wasn\u2019t a distraction either. If people are upset because the actors look odd and aren\u2019t as good looking then they should think again. Nothing is noticeably bad, rather it\u2019s realistic. And, if Birdman hasn\u2019t bagged any Oscars for acting then what acting are we talking about? Sharlto Copley was awesome and how he brings Chappie to life from an inanimate is commendable.\rBlomkamp has expanded big time on philosophical content in films and he really provides us with something to think about. What is consciousness and how can it pass on? Does it itself make someone exist or we only exist when others believe that we do? It\u2019s a classical existential film which tells us how important it is for us to attach meaning and purpose to a cause. It\u2019s also a statement on how the world is a bad place for an outcast or someone who is different, and expands on his earlier xenophobic themes in films.\r I must add that there are some missed opportunities in this film as well. The sense of style in District 9 was there but not as good and because of this the film lacked unity in style. Secondly, they could have done better with some strong actors even though the acting wasn\u2019t so bad. Third, some of the characters were really not necessary for e.g. Dev Patel could have had a minor role. They draw attention away from our main character i.e. Chappie. Also, the antagonists could have definitely been stronger and more intimidating. Lastly, it needed to be a little darker and going by D9 it fell a little short.\r However, saying all that doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that this is still a very emotional film and gets you to choke every now and then. At the same time it is filled with some tense action scenes. It\u2019s delivered on its ideas too and is subtle enough to scratch your head when you think about those existential questions. But, above all it\u2019s a fun ride with Chappie who\u2019s thrown into this world with no knowledge of things around him. Definitely could have done better with a little more fun and humor, but either way it was still a great watch. I loved it and I have my own reasons no matter what the others say, especially the recognized critics. So, I suggest to go and find it out for yourself because, \u201cI am consciousness, I\u2019m Chappie\u201d"

Instead of being a pure robot action movie, they try to take on the when does something become truly alive. If a mechanical device becomes self aware and has the ability to learn in its own, should it be thought of like a human.\r The concept is not be all that new. Everything from Blade Runner to Ghose In The Shell has hit the same basic concepts.\r If can except some of the stretches in science used in the movie and do not mind some pacing issues with for the most part predictable characters and story lines, this should be a good movie to watch. It is much better than movies like Lawnmower Man and Transcendence which take on the idea of transferring a soul or mind from one body to another. The acting was good on average. It was nice to see Hugh Jackman take on a bad guy role. It is just to bad it was a very common bad guy role. Sigourney Weaver also delivered a very cliche character. I think both Jackman and Weaver could have been pushed to make their characters more unique.\r If you are looking for a mindless action movie, this is not it. If you liked Blade Runner or you love all things SCi-Fi, then this is worth seeing in theaters."

I loved this movie, and I thought it was a very well done analysis of consciousness and self/self-identity. A beautiful coming-of-age film.\r What impressed me most about this film was that I didn't feel like I was watching a smart robot come to self awareness, but, rather, I was watching a consciousness come to self realization. Chappie's development in the film was impressively organic. Often robot movies like this one suffer from too many eureka moments and light-bulb-above-the-head cliches: the problem with these cliches, is they don't reflect how living consciousness grows as we experience it in humans (our only reference point). Chappie really feels like a human consciousness, just trying to learn how to live the best he can. Chappie does not feel like a robot learning that he is alive, which is appropriate since, as a consciousness, his \"alive-ness\" is taken for granted from birth.\r The film really moved me, and I was in tears several times. The action was also great, as was ALL the acting. The narrative was, in fact, solid, even if it wasn't revolutionary. It told the story it needed to. Directing was also well done.\r I would give this film a 9, but it moved me so much, that I feel I owe it a 10. Can't wait to see it again!\r Really underrated. I am confident that in time this movie will be more well liked. This may be a case of expectations ruin the movie? I really don't know."

Films like \"Life is Beautiful\" and \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" have brought a tear to my eye, but \"Chappie\" is the first movie to ever make me break down and cry. It's a truly brilliant film; even its action sequences affirm the humanity of the movie's title character. Its refreshing, idealistic (and ultimately proper) view of human nature is something we sorely need in an era where nihilism dominates our culture. It's a hopeful film and a wonderful one. It's also brilliantly written, acted, and shot. Don't believe the critics on this one. The cerebral could broadside them with a club and they'd still cast their bids for Oscar-bait trash. \"Chappie\" is a magnificent exploration on what it means to grow as a human person. If you've even an inkling of hope or creativity in you, then this movie is for you."

There are plenty of other movies out there already that have tackled the subject of AI, consciousness, etc, but: this one did it much, much better.\r I'm surprised to see such negative reviews, but the best parts of the movie were subtle. This is a movie where paying attention is rewarded immensely, whether it comes to Chappie's animations or the small moments that affect Chappie's character development.\r I laughed hard, I teared up, I came away satisfied."

I think it might be the South African sensibility of the whole movie. This is one of the most fundamentally sound films I've seen in a very long time. It's an action-comedy love letter to the musical duo Die Antwoord. I'm a Die Antwoord fan but even if I wasn't I would understand what Blomkamp was trying to do. This was like a modern day Yellow Submarine with more movie than music and Die Antwoord doesn't suck at acting like the Beatles did. Ninja and Yolandi were actually very solid actors for this being their first film. The rest of the cast crushed it because they're all incredibly talented especially Patel. I hear a lot about Jackman's two dimensional villain and how bad it was, but that's what kind of movie this is. It's a serious movie that never takes itself too seriously. I swear to Science that film critics these days are so far up their own a***s that they wouldn't know a good movie if it puked in their face. Chappie is a solid flick and deserves praise. I think Die Antwoord should be praised for how solid they were in this movie."

Everyone character is alone, from Sigourney Weaver to Hugh Jackman. Even the gang members aren't united. Blomkamp hands it to us on a platter with the 'Black Sheep' story but the critics overlooked it. It's a film about trying to find your identity. It's about bullies. Its about how cruel and selfish  people can be. 'You all lie!' A couple of plot holes, yes, but hopefully, in time, this film will find it's way into acceptance. A shame for all involved as there's much to discover, not all so obvious."

      "text": "(spoilers ahead) So I'm a pretty big fan of these critical thinking movies, and there's a lot of thinking and philosophy to be gained from this movie and the movie does a great job with the whole theme of god, humanity, immortality, and loss of innocence as we watch our main character Chappie come to terms with the world. But here's the thing that personally got me and that's the ending, it wasn't terrible but int the whole build up of Chappie essentially dying and with this looming death overhead he tries to find other means to try and live even breaking his promise with Dion saying he will do no crime so there's the loss of innocence as he ignores Dion and get's tempted by everyone else to do commit crime, and in the end it should of been a confrontation with him and Dion (his maker) who is kinda portraying god who at the end of the movie is dying from a fight but Chappie believes he can save him by transferring his consciousness into another robot essentially letting him live forever, but this is successful and Chappie does come to terms with his death happy to sacrifice himself so that his maker is alive and well but Dion then say he can save Chappie too and this is successful. I am saying that a sadder ending would of been miles better in delivering a message about humanity and all but in the end the overall movie is visually stunning with his robotics and does provide a look on someone growing up and facing hardships making him stronger for it (even though the movie is being held within the spam of a week). I was actually sort of thinking the story would of been different like the police were abusing their power and a guy who made the robots get's another point of view and decides to help by trying to create a robot that will help rise against the oppressors and this goes with the theme of Chappie growing up and is being pulled by two sides as both argue a somewhat valid point like one guy suggest going against the robots and that'll take the power for the corrupted another suggest go for the head of the snake and kill the corrupted so they can instead have the power."
