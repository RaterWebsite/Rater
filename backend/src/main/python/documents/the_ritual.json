This created great scary scenes, that determine a horror movie. Second, the dialogues were realistic and that contributed to the emotional and cognitive intensified effect of immersion in film. Plus perfect acting and interesting story with hidden meaning. So I guess The Ritual could be a little bit boring for real horror fans, who have watched a lot. But I'm very impressed by this film and I recommend it!"

After having watched it, I am quite annoyed with how low scores this movie gets from the pro reviewers. The tension this movie establishes is beyond what I've seen in a long time.It is absolutely fantastically put together. It reveals just enough throughout to keep you curious about the whole thing. The acting is top-notch, especially in the scenes where the group is falling apart from sheer psychological pressure.And the effects, oh boy, is it well done! And there's a twist to the story that I'm not sure people will get unless they think the whole situation through. And it's a nasty realization when you do.This movie surpassed my expectations on pretty much all levels."

I missed the scene where they first arrive at the first cabin but I doubt that would change how good this film is. My only wishes are that it wasn't longer and that the leads yelling didn't sound so much like Howard Deans."

      "text": "Since its inception, I\u2019ve typically dreaded scrolling through the horror options found on Netflix. The service has always been littered with straight to video garbage and lackluster sequels, although recently the service\u2019s original programming has become my go to for a horror fix. Releasing 1922, The Babysitter, and now The Ritual directly to their service has made access to Netflix more important to me than ever before.The Ritual starts out with our protagonists planning a group vacation while at a local bar. After throwing around some ideas and nothing being set in stone, the group heads to the local liquor store where one of the group members is violently mugged, resulting in his death. Fast forward 6 months and our group of characters are hiking through Sweden, which was the late friend\u2019s suggestion. While the characters are not horribly written nor are the performances poor, they are simply interchangeable, with only occasional bits of personality shining through.Early into their trip one of the friends suffers a minor injury; both his friends and the viewer will likely question whether or not he\u2019s faking it. When one of the men notices a shortcut through a dense patch of forest area, they debate on whether they want to stick to the path or continue through parts unknown. Very soon after the group enters the heavy foliage, things start to get weird.I\u2019m not sure about most people, but I can wholeheartedly say that seeing an eviscerated deer hanging from about 10 feet in the air, still dripping blood would probably have me running back out of the woods as fast as my feet could carry me, almost as if my head was on fire. Does this affect our group? Not in the slightest. While there are a few comments about how it could have been a bear or hunters, it really doesn\u2019t feel plausible and makes our heroes look a bit dumb, but they proceed anyway.After a brutal storm begins they seek shelter in an abandoned cabin, which houses a strange human-esque shaped shrine in the upper floor. This is when things really pick up; characters will wake up inexplicably outside of the cabin, found naked worshiping the shrine in their sleep, hallucinating or suffering strange unexplained wounds. From here on out, it\u2019s clear that something is out in the woods and it does not like them one bit. At this point in the film, the tension finally picks up and the horror they are facing really sets in.I am a huge fan of movies that are so confident in their visual effects that they show the creature or monsters up close in full light without the need to use smart camera angles, but can also respect when the director chooses to hide a more impressive creature to build tension; The Ritual has the best of both worlds. Early into the film you will occasionally get a glimpse of the creature, but it\u2019s not until the last fifteen to twenty minutes of the film you really get to see it in all of its glory. One scene, which features a blazing fire behind it, really highlights the creature and will likely haunt you for days, which says something considering you only see its silhouette at this point.Up until I actually saw the being, I felt that the movie was going to head down a B movie route, lacking the budget for the grotesque thing that we actually ended up with. The monster would be best described as a moving Rorschach test, since anyone you ask will likely have a different description of it. For me, it appeared to be a mummified horse, with a spider-like head made of corpses. Regardless of how you look at it, the thing is one of the best designed movie monsters in years.While the acting isn\u2019t outright bad, I did have to watch the movie with closed captioning due to the actors\u2019 British accents being extremely thick. Coupled with their unique slang, some of the more verbal scenes are a bit hard to follow. It may have been the difficulty I experienced following the conversations, but I found these areas to be a bit dull compared other scenes. When the film picks up, it rarely slows down. The fact that you do not see the creature in more than brief glimpses throughout the midpoint of the film, as well as the occasional flash or flicker of something moving in the foliage around the lost hikers, you\u2019re bound to be on the edge of your seat.While The Ritual is nothing we haven\u2019t seen before, it does offer a solid horror experience at no additional cost than the standard Netflix fee. It\u2019s far from perfect, but the creature alone makes this one worth giving a view."

The acting was great, the backstory behind the antagonist made sense, and the overarching struggle between the main character and his past and present dilemmas were all connected well without exposing too much and giving away crucial details. This definitely helped to keep the audience guessing. Overall, I recommend this movie wholeheartedly. Ps- My girlfriend was so spooked I couldn't even get her to finish the movie, if that's any indication that it is in fact scary haha."

As the movie goes on the scenes get weirder \"scarier\". I actually feel bad for Luke because at the end of the movie, all his friends are dead. I also liked the way they put the J\u00f6tunn in the movie and the way that made it look. When Dom was about to die and he was seeing a woman in front of him but they zoom out and its the J\u00f6tunn I thought that was cool. There was some gore and blood and I think it fit this movie well. So ill give this a 10/10 :))"

It feel much more real, coupled with the fact that these are older blokes as opposed to the teen fodder that usually gets offed in American productions. Setting a haunted forest premise in picturesque Sweden is such a good idea it seems absurd that this is not done more often. After all, those fairy tales that have terrified children for generations have their roots in European forests, so it is fitting that this works so well.It is tense, terrifying, and truly beautiful, offering the barest of hints to begin with and developing further as the tale progresses. A must see."

Everything here was meticulously crafted.  The attention to detail, sound scape, visual effects, performances, story, pacing and even the script were all first rate.  Very few budget horror films are able to pull this off.  It's probably the best in what Ill consider it's genre (scary forest movies). People will compare it to other movies in it's niche because it's easy for them to do so.  Fine. Neat. Its like blair witch in the same sense that star trek is like star wars.  For me it was a better depiction of Lovecraft-style helplessness than I've ever seen. It also featured probably the best creature design and execution I've seen since Alien. Finally it managed to change out its rythm and rules set like modern masterpiece horror films such as \"martyrs\" were able to do. Like martyrs, this film will be wildly underrated.  It will also likely be lost for many in the ocean of content coming out.  I hope the creators receive the praise they deserve.  I'm very glad I saw it. If you like lovecraft, horror, mud or monsters I highly recommend this. The critics are wrong again."

      "text": "One of the most surprising horror movies to come out in a long time. The basic premise (some may call it simplistic and clich\u00e9) actually serves it very well, because it quickly veers into a territory that has never really been explored in horror films before. It's been explored, but never without this level of success. The Ritual has a firm grip on atmospherics and a very competent cast elevate this film with a lot of internal conflict and palpable dread. It's beautifully shot and briskly paced, with plenty to go in terms of phychological anguish and physical revulsion. Some nasty twists elevate this into a tale of pure Lovecraftian terror, that which is quite cosmic and unspeakable. It just gets rid of the tentacles and replaces that by ancient Nordic pagan deities worship mayhem.Netflix originals are incredibly hit or miss, but in the horror department, this is clearly a hit. It's part The Descent, part The Void, part The VVitch, part Deliverance. It just works, and the movie's self awareness certainly works in its favor. However, if you find the unknown more terrifying that what you can see, you may be disappointed once the movie chooses to make it's big reveal."

      "text": "This was probably the most surprising creatively original horror I've seen in years. I thought the trailer looked promising enough but never expected this story to absolutely enthrall me like it did. From the beginning your attention is captured with a very brutally somber intro that plays a deep role into the overall tale. You're then immersed into a magnificently scenic, yet eerie mountain forest setting where the atmosphere is incredibly effective. I cannot say enough about the beautiful imagery and camerawork throughout. As everything unravels it becomes an outstandingly creepy and suspenseful turn of events unlike anything you've seen before. They executed the big reveals towards the final frightening half hour brilliantly and thats where this horror film rises above so many with its extremely unnervingly bizarre conclusion that you will never see coming. The creature design was insanely crafted and refreshing, and will stay in your mind forever as one of the best concepts put on screen. Rafe Spell's performance was utterly intense, and you really feel for his character after certain events. Overall I'd rate this an 8.7/10 and would HIGHLY recommend it to any watcher. I really wish this received a theatrical release around the world but you can now add it to the many great netflix original films that keep surprising everyone."

Beautiful Alida Valli plays his \u2018partner\u2019 (Irma) who has taken up with another man. She\u2019s unsure if she\u2019s making the right decision but as she\u2019s done this sort of thing before, it appears maybe she has an unstable mental condition. In fact, this picture tends to paint a rather unflattering picture of womanhood. Aldo takes to the road looking for work with his young daughter in tow. Most of the women he comes across are either loose or uncommitted to a lasting relationship. One of the only stable women is Elvia convincingly played by Betsy Blair (Mrs Gene Kelly) She\u2019s an old girlfriend of Aldo\u2019s who\u2019s still hopeful of rekindling the relationship \u2013 unfortunately for both, Aldo is unable to get over the loss of Irma and following a drunken flirtation by Elvia\u2019s sister, played by beautiful Gabriella Pallotta, he decides it\u2019s best to move on. The locations are as dismal as the story situations and there appear to be some minor continuity problems but, it\u2019s the rather ambiguous ending that seems to be more \u2018tacked on\u2019 as a means to an end - relying on tragedy elements to make it memorable.  This received some Awards but these look to be more from an industry trying to \u2018sell\u2019 the picture - than for art\u2019s sake. It\u2019s always a curious watch and director of Photography Gianni Di Venanzo (8 1/2) gives it a class look. The music score by prolific composer Giovanni Fusco (The Confession) is rather unusual with a nice piano soliloquy giving some haunting quality - all performances are generally good but the story and settings may not please a big audience. At least it\u2019s more approachable than director Antonioni\u2019s later pretentious efforts and the DVD Mastering offers a good transfer \u2013 subtitles are also OK."

The gore is pretty brutal and this movie actually makes you feel for what is happening between these 4 friends. The cinematography is beautiful and it kept me hooked the whole way through. Lessons I learned from this movie;1. Don\u2019t hike deep in the mountains, especially if there is a forest involved 2. Punch a creepy old forest lady in the face3. Yell"
