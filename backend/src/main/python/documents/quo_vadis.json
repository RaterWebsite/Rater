The actors deserve Oscars and it's a shame the movie did not get the well-desrved attention across the Atlantic... no matter, Pawel Delag convinced me he's a man in love, the girls were all beatiful and talented, Boguslaw Linda the refferee of elegance and the Greek 'Judas' was perfect... I started learning Polish words just by seeing it over and over... as I did once before when watching The Healer... Unfortunately, we don't see many Polish movies... from whatever Polish I can understand, I saw Pawel Delag dancing on stage, perhaps he sings as well, a man of theatre playing in musicals and making such a great part in QV, playing the Roman who turns into a Christian... charming, gifted and versatile he has all an artist could dream of, blessings be upon thee."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Sorry Americans,but Europe has always had and has better movies than you,onl less money...And to Anabella,if zou think he is handsome check out Micha?
