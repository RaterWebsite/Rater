The refreshing dialogues between Clooney and Cassidy makes it to an experience for the whole family. all combined with a litle action and a litle fun."

      "text": "Often feeling like a modern attempt to rekindle the joy and sense of adventure of 1980s science fiction films, Tomorrowland largely feels like a paltry imitation that has no idea what made those films work. Though capably acted throughout with a compelling premise, Tomorrowland gets too bogged down in the details and forgets to have a good time, instead opting to rush through its conclusion that may have a heart warming message, but really lacks the quality build-up to make it all pay-off. Though fashionable to criticize screenwriter Damon Lindelof for the issues of every film he touches, I have never had that much of a problem with the man. However, Tomorrowland most certainly falters because of its script, though with Brad Bird having a hand in the script and directing the film, the buck stops with him and there are some issues here that should have been stopped from the beginning, ignoring the internal inconsistency that also plagues the film, but could be ignored if the film were better.This major issue is the fact that the film is two-thirds exposition and character introduction. Introducing us to Frank Walker (George Clooney), his love of inventing, and how he arrived in Tomorrowland with the help of a young girl/robot named Athena (Raffey Cassidy) who recruits dreamers to come to Tomorrowland, the film then introduces us to Casey Newton (Britt Robertson). Explaining everything about their lives, showing pointless backstory about how they love science and invention, and then having Athena and Casey race to meet Frank, it takes a while for the film to introduce its central problem. While some could say they introduce it early when Athena says that Casey is needed to fix Tomorrowland because somebody made something they should not have made, that is merely a foreshadow to what the actual problem is. It is not until two-thirds of the way into the film or so that we actually learn what the problem is: the world is ending. Within half an hour, the disaster is averted due to Casey's optimism and ability to help the world stop focusing on the negative and instead refocus the world on the positive sides of things. How does she do this, you ask? Spoiler: (though a spoiler, it is one that can save you 130 minutes of your life, so I do recommend you read it) she blows it up. Yes, that is literally all there is to it. In order to justify going an extra thirty minutes, there is some fighting between our heroes and chief bad guy David Nix (Hugh Laurie), some fuss about a bomb, and sequences of Casey learning the world will end and freaking out about all of it before saving it and then teaming up with Frank to fix everything and repopulate Tomorrowland with a new set of dreamers. Until this largely cliche sequence that is just filler, there is further filler early on with Frank initially being hesitant to help Casey only to be influenced to help her when he sees guard robots from Tomorrowland following her with the mission of killing her. The film largely goes through the beats of any adventure film about somebody tasked with saving the world and needing the help of somebody who came before them and may or may not have had a hand in creating the present situation. It is a film that has been done many times before and will be made again in the future. For a film that has such an inventive premise, it is a shame to see it just slowly wind up becoming highly derivative and never breathing life into anything.The script's internal consistency is also a major issue. For example, David Nix says the machine cannot be turned off. Though it is not turned off, it is blown up, which apparently turns it off. Without any explanation as to how the world is saved and rapidly becomes what it once was where people were optimistic about the future instead of afraid of what was to come, everything is fixed. The machine that caused it having the impact it has similarly makes no sense. Allowing the user to see the past, present, and future around the world, it apparently sends radio waves or something out to other dimensions and its mere presence via these waves - even if not tapped into - caused the world to see a bleak future that was coming true via a self-fulfilling prophecy. Or something like that. With regard to the character of Athena, she is incapable of love, emotion, and having ideas, until she loves Frank, has emotions regarding the end of their time together, and has an idea on how to fix everything. Though just minor examples, these do hint to how much this film alters from its 80 minutes of exposition just out of pure convenience or forgetting the fact that it had been previously defined. The film even contradicts things mere moments after it is introduced, which really makes this one incredibly lazily written and inexcusable."

Sometimes a script that should have been an hour long TV show gets stretched into a two hour movie; I would put this in that category."

Microsoft, Google, Sony ... l\u2019avaient fait, mais la Disney \u00e9crase tout.C\u2019est un film qui commence diff\u00e9remment des autres films basiques -> gros m\u00e9chants, des gentils et terminer.Non dans celui-ci Disney commence par vous faire r\u00eaver .... avec c\u2019est deux sc\u00e8nes d\u2019introduction magique. Puis il vous montre qui sont les gentils, vous fait conna\u00eetre quelque m\u00e9chant sans importance qui font un petit clin d\u2019oeil a TERMINATOR (au passage), vous rappelle que Star Wars est une licence qui leur appartient et en profite pour faire de la pub (ce qui mon fait plaisir,pourquoi? Car ce n\u2019est pas un panneau publicitaire ...) Puis \u00e0 la fin le gigantesque m\u00e9chant.C\u2019est une progression que j\u2019admire de la part du r\u00e9alisateur. C\u2019est tr\u00e8s chouette.Je n\u2019ai pas vu ce film en 3D, mais au vu de toutes les sc\u00e8nes je ne sais pas si c\u2019\u00e9tait vraiment la peine.Des musiques sympathiques qui nous font rentrer dans cet univers de r\u00eave.Bref si vous avez des enfants ce film correspond quasiment \u00e0 la perfection.Un film que je conseille vivement"

      "text": "First off, the visuals/CGI in this are really good! I found it a very entertaining and enjoyable watch due to the different colourful worlds shown. Its quite engrossing. It definitely has a childlike naivety to it but then it is a Disney film and it seemed like a family friendly film for the most part, so thats ok.I liked the fantasy element of it. The colours are quite vivid, even in scenes set on modern day Earth, so it has a comic book type feel to it visually, aside from the CGI aspect. I felt it was a nice escapist watch - it reminded me somewhat of the Spy Kids films, in terms of the mix of CGI environments and real life scenes, although with better effects of course. I quite like watching the adult (George Clooney, rather than Antonio Banderas like in the Spy Kids films) getting flustered, while the kids seem to know exactly what their doing. There was one scene which made me think of Mr Magorium's Wonder Emporium, if but briefly.However, it does take a rather sombre tone towards the end, which some may criticise it for, as it highlights the worrying future for our planet due to the activity of humans, i.e. the impact of climate change etc.Overall (that aside) this is a fun watch which I'd recommend."

The pace was not good at the starting. It takes the movie about 30 minutes to really kick into gear but it will not effect your overall experience. I enjoyed the plot of slowly figuring out what is Tomorrowland and what's the purpose behind it all. Yes, the movie is not a perfect one but it is neither a bad one.I have read quite a lot of negative comments about this movie and even its message and I find that to be slightly odd. The main purpose of this movie was to provide fun and entertainment to the audience and it does fulfill it's purpose.Overall, I will surely recommend this movie to anyone. At least it tried something new in childish and entertaining way. Don't check critics reviews, they wrote more childish reviews than the movie's story."

Clooney is in fine form as the reluctant hero here, even if a lot of his job is exposition that slows the film down, and the production design is stunning, add to that a couple of outstanding action sequences and you should have a hit, but Tomorrowland comes across as a well meaning vegetarian meal when what you really want is a nice juicy hamburger. Its very well meaning, and really wants to educate, it just needed to be that little bit more fun."

But come on , Brad Bird has given us so much, lets do him a favour and simply go watch this film."

Through the eyes of an idealistic boy, we could see what we all hoped for, an idealistic, and healthy future for ourselves, and everyone. A girl, that is tech savvy and not wearing god awful pink, that is the strong character, that rebels against what she believes is wrong, and doesn't have a preoccupation with her parents. Without spoiling the storyline includes a jetpack...in the sixties, I couldn't wait till the seventies when I could jetpack to school....\rI couldn't wait for this film to come out!\rI brought my son, and we weren't disappointed...and left the movie...saying how can we make this happen?\rThis movie has a positive message, and doesn't succumb to the simplistic doomsday without a fight!\rThere are plenty of inferences to make the movie really interesting....for a change, its not as simple as it may seem...unless you are simple"

One, Tomorrowland is nothing like the majority of bad reviews it's painted to be.  Reason two, people just weren't ready for a story that doesn't travel from point A to B in fast cars, guns blazing, in a straight line.\r There is much involved in the story, thus the general viewer will be bored, especially when it's a film about imagination and also about being a better person.. If people asked me what this film was about then that's what I would say.\rTomorrowland is film that was given a chance to be created and it just didn't pay off due to no fault of it's own.  So I want to thank the people that made this film possible.  People complain when a film is a rehash yet when something new and refreshing comes along, it's ignored and in this case.. unfairly reviewed.\rIf Studio Ghibli, Miyazaki had made this film and had it animated, then it would have been hailed as a classic and won the animated movie catergory in most awards. It really does feel like a Ghibli movie and I feel if you like Studio Ghibli, then you would like Tomorrowland. It simply does not feel like a normal Hollywood movie, which is why it failed.\r In short, Brad Bird has yet again made an excellent film, well written, well directed and well acted by all involved.  Don't buy into it's box office failure, just give it a go."

I was charmed by the retro look of the opening scenes at the 1964 World's Fair (I remember that, and it was pretty close to the remembered reality). One of the best things about the movie is the uncanny resemblance between the actor who plays a young Frank Walker and George Clooney, who plays him as an adult.  As sci-fi movies go, this was pretty tame, although there were a few neat special effects (a particular favorite being the multi-level swimming pools).  The premise behind the movie, that we affect the future by our attitude is something worth thinking about, \"Faux\" news aside. Other than a rather gruesome visit to a hobby shop, there isn't much that is scary in the movie, so it would be okay for younger kids (age 7 and up, I'd say). For adults, well, you have to arrest your analytical mind for a bit to just enjoy the movie at face value (not always easy to do, I admit).  But to share it with a younger person, who finds it charming and exciting and rich with possibilities...?  Well, that made the viewing worthwhile. If you don't have a younger friend to bring with you, you might just want to skip this one. But don't forget the message: we all need to work together to ensure the future of the planet!"

      "text": "Disney's theme park attraction is the inspiration for this sci-fi adventure. A teen (Britt Robertson) gains access to a dazzling future world and teams up to save it with an exiled inventor (George Clooney, whose boyhood character looks confusingly like her young brother). The brief visits to this incredible place are full of eye-popping visuals and cool creative concepts, but most of the movie takes place in the present day. When director Brad Bird switches on the action, it's lots of fun (even though there's a surprising body count for Disney). The disjointed plot sometimes loses focus and momentum, especially near the talky end. There's lots here to spark the imagination, but at 130 minutes it's too long to maintain the magic."

This is every bit the imaginative, epic, entertaining film you could ever hope to see in the theater. My wife and I (in our 40s) along with our two kids (age 9 and 12) all absolutely LOVED this film! For a film to equally excite and entertain all members of the family as this one did is truly something special.\rAdd to that the wonderful and welcome positive messages of finding good in yourself and others and being the change you want to see in the world (among others).  This was not only a visual treat, but a delight in every way from the acting to the storytelling.  Look, I can be picky too, but those who are picking on this film must be the ones who didn't get a Tomorrowland pin.  (You'll have to see the movie to find out what that means.)  :-)  ENJOY!"

I had no preconception, no anticipation, and frankly hadn't heard about the film until 2 days prior to release, so I came in with a clean slate.\r Tomorrowland is an abundant, multi-course dinner with a few side-orders of mystery. Unfortunately, some of the mystery is without a real purpose. There ARE many, attractive plates on this table, but you won't have time to taste them all...\r Still, for all its challenges, this movie is magical, and amazing. I couldn't help being charmed by the innocence and magic of Tomorrowland. Raffey Cassidy as Athena is almost a movie unto herself, as she is a point of light that almost outshines the problems with the story. (There is a point where Athena drives offscreen and the movie just deflates). I also liked Britt Robertson's Casey, intelligent, but not full of herself. No princesses in this Disney film. George Clooney is in a good role, but plays in 3rd place behind the 2 females. Hugh Laurie is basically wasted, especially his ultimately ineffectual demise.\r In the end, I enjoyed Tomorrowland as a whole. It is a flight of fancy, and a pretty fancy one at that. Sure, it can be preachy, and shallow, and inexplicable, but it's a heck of a romp! The pure beauty of this unique, though somewhat flawed, gem of a movie is worth seeing, and though I rarely consider seeing movies a 2nd time in the theater, I'm compelled to do just that to get back to Tomorrowland again. I also give it an extra star for both of the female actors. Thank you Brad Bird. Looking forward to the Incredibles 2!"

First of all, Tommorowland is cliched to the max, plot twists are predictable, and the story is peppy and bubbly futuristic vibe. George Clooney gives a masterful performance, and Britt Robinson gives a good perfromance too. The worst part of Tommorowland is that it doesnt live up to the hype that it had. Brad Bird instead gave us a beautiful movie, but had no good film underneath that layer. Tommorowland is inspired by Disney's famous theme park, and there is a slight vibe added to it. There is Hugh Laurie as a maniac though. Sadly, it is a let down, but if you admire creativity, give this a watch."

      "text": "I had decently high expectations for this film. I thought this movie would good fun. It was. I thought it would be well acted. Doubly so. It was far better than I expected.  The two words I think best describing it are optimistic, and engaging. I think that in this day, people don't like optimism so much; they see it as naive. I often see it that way myself. I can be very cynical, and tell myself that is just the way the world is. This movie is very optimistic, but it is not naive. They have an actual, clear point, that I believe is very well made, despite the fact that I can't see the world that way. I think those who say the plot is off, or lacking in substance, simply disagree with the message. One sentence summary of the review: This is an amazing movie, and anyone who has any real interest should definitely see it.\r Onto specifics (this is long):\r Visually, the movie was very appealing. The CGI was not always spectacular (though it was always very good), but it was always on point, serving its purpose very well. The non cgi stuff was very well done, perhaps better than the cgi. The world was bright and colorful when appropriate, and the opposite when that was appropriate.\r The action sequences were very well done, and somewhat more serious than you might expect in a PG Disney movie. There was more weight to them than I expected. Nothing to worry about showing to children, of course, but not dumbed down either.\r Coming into this year, I expected my favorite movie would be the second Avengers movie. That was reinforced when I saw it.  That said, Tomorrowland is a better movie. It has better acting, more of a point, and is more intellectual. It is also a lot more fun. This is coming from a big-time Joss Whedon fanboy.\r My favorite member of the cast was Britt Robertson. She was note perfect the entire time. It wasn't unusual  to have her reaction to what was going on around her cause my own. I've liked her for a while, but she far surpassed my expectations.\r That said, all of the actors and actresses surpassed my expectations considerably. While that probably means I underestimated them, that is also a major credit to the director, Brad Bird. I didn't know his name before the lead up to this movie, but I looked up what he's directed, which includes The Incredibles and a number of other relatively famous movies, and I think this is easily the best thing he's made.\r I would like to make a special note of Raffey Cassidy; most kids can't act. She most definitely can.\r I've described this movie as fun and optimistic, but there is definitely some pathos to it. It doesn't try to pretend things are better than they are. The full spectrum of emotions is there. It shows the world in all of its bleakness. It just isn't willing to write us off.\r If you've read this far, see it. You'll probably love it, but even if you don't, even if you disagree entirely with its message, it is well worth your time. It was well worth mine."

The Michael Jordan of Film Directors, his previous 3 animated films established him in a class above all others.  In Tomorrowland, it seems Mr. Bird and company were having an off game. I had read the negative reviews by critics and then more positive reviews by fellow film goers. With all that in mind I was prepared to be both entertained and disappointed. But then as the film got rolling I was convinced that the negative reviews were all part of some conspiracy to undermine a wonderful film about dreaming boldly and bravely making those dreams come true. However well into the second hour I realized the proverbial hot air balloon of wonder was quickly loosing altitude. The ride was almost over and we hadn't gotten to the promised land of innovation and inspiration.\r The characters where all very likable, the premise was exciting, but as others have complained there was far too little tomorrowland time or deeper glimpses of what made the supposed special characters special. Ugh. In spite of falling short, did it succeed in inspiring me to dream big and make those dreams happen (maybe making the world a better place)? Maybe, but no more than the 2 minute trailers did. Ok, the scene early in film about the young inventor explaining his jet pack was brilliant, but few further inspired moments followed. Still think the world of Mr. Bird, but as with all heros, realized he is in fact mortal. Maybe next time he'll lose the co-writer and keep it true to his gifted inspired vision."

One of the first things you will notice with this movie is that the film looks beautiful and the cinematography is great. Geroge Clooney and Britt Robertson work together in a way that is unparreled in most of the big budget films today, but Tomorrwland is held down by uneven pacing. I will admit that the first and last twenty minutes are boring but not enough to make you disinterested.

The most optimistic movie I can think of since Field of Dreams 25 years ago.  Nlot quite a visionary movie, not quite a spiritual movie, however if you like Brad Bird, see it.  This is great directing in so many ways.  He gets uncanny performances out of Clooney and Raffey Cassidy.  Cassidy is likely to become a star based on the performance Bird gets out of her here.\r The plot features many ironic turns and meta-comments that keep it alive thru most of its run.  At the end the villain delivers what is usually the hero's or heroine's speech and this worked well for me.  The effects are amazing and top-level all around. At $190 million, much of that is up on the screen for sure."
