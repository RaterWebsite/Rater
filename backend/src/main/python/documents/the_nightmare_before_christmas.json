I know his films are very oddball, but he has a wide imagination and his films are visually amazing. And I like a vast majority of his films, Edward Scissorhands being my personal favourite, and I love Batman and Batman Returns too. Henry Sellick is also promising, from the likes of James and the Giant Peach and Coraline. The Nightmare Before Christmas is a brilliant film. Is it an animated classic. Yes I think it is! It is wonderfully weird yet lots of fun as well. Visually and technically, the film looks absolutely amazing, with wonderful Gothic backgrounds and detailed colouring. Skellington silhouetted against the moonlight is quite possibly the film's most haunting image. The story is great, about Jack Skellington discovering ChristmasTown but doesn't understand the concept so he kidnaps Santa Claus. And the characters are endearing and weird, ranging from jazz playing zombies, Four-tenor like vampires to a wolf man. Then we have the title characters, Jack Skellington is a wonderful protagonist, really interesting to say the least. And Sally for an inventor's creation is very beautiful. The songs from Danny Elfman(the fact that he didn't get an award for his score for Edward Scissorhands is the biggest music snubs ever) are great fun, haunting, funny, clever and intelligent. The voice acting is top notch, Chris Sarandon does a great job as the speaking voice of Skellington, and Danny Elfman himself provides the singing voice superbly. Catherine O'Hara is sweet and innocent, and Ken Page(the voice of King Gator in All Dogs Go To Heaven) is a hoot as Oogie Boogie. All in all, weird, but visually stunning, funny and intelligent animated movie. A definite classic! 10/10 Bethany Cox"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Overall FantasticNightmare Before Christmas is a perfect mix of Halloween and Christmas with terrific stop motion animation."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Have always loved this movie!

It has spectacular visual effects. The story and screenplay are remarkable. The soundtrack phenomenal and I especially love the songs This Is Halloween, Sally's Song, and What's This. The soundtrack is my favorite animated movie soundtrack, my 3rd favorite movie soundtrack of all time and one of my favorite albums of all time. The voice over performances were stupendous and very well done especially from Chris Sarandon/Danny Elfman, Catherine O'Hara, Ken Page, and William Hickey. The Nightmare Before Christmas is my favorite Halloween movie of all time, my favorite Christmas movie of all time, my favorite stop-motion movie, one of my top 5 favorite musicals, one of my top 5 favorite animated movies, and one of my favorite movies of all time.

The beautifully conducted stop motion technique, the catchy musical numbers that may not be counted as Danny Elfman\u2019s compositional masterpieces, but still make the movie a lot more entertaining than it would have been without them, and the weird sort of humour that isn\u2019t to make you laugh out loud, but have you chuckling almost perpetually. Nevertheless, it\u2019s still a bit disappointing that a movie this sort can still be boring here and there and the screenplay also isn\u2019t always successful in maintaining an acceptable balance between child-oriented silliness and adult-suitability (though I adore the Hamlet reference). Through that, difficulties arise as the movie ends up being too ridiculous for most adults and too scary for most kids in the target audience. But still I\u2019d say that sparing one hour and fifteen minutes to see this truly one-of-a-kind movie can\u2019t hurt."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The Nightmare Before Christmas is an animation as scary as cute and its story is quite funny."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS was an interesting idea for a family/horror/musical blend, but especially for a Tim Burton film, it wasn't really achieved all that well.

Halloween town is a special place where anything Halloween themed and Halloween related live, scary and strange things like monsters, werewolves, vampires, skeletons, zombies and many others things. The most popular Halloween creature of them all is a tall slender skeleton in a suit, his name is Jack Skellington. Jack Skellington voiced by Chris Sarandon and Danny Elfman (singing voice) is getting bored of doing the same thing every year for Halloween, so he stumbles across a door which leads to a Christmas themed world. Jack Skellington gets very interested and decides that he wants to celebrate Christmas instead of Halloween.\r Overall The Nightmare Before Christmas is very fun to watch with a family and children love it.

My only qualm is that the movie is a bit short and not very climactic, but when the universe beyond the screen is so full of beautiful imagery, emotional musical numbers, and tenderness, it's difficult not to get lost. When everything is so imaginative and alive, pulsating with wonder, it's hard to be anything but captivated.

Great songs, great animation, great everything."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This animated film for adults and adolescents focuses on Jack Skellington, the most notable citizen of Halloween Town, and the unexpected trip he made to the Christmas City, where he discovers the Christmas spirit without, however, understanding it. Directed and written by Tim Burton, the film features the voices of Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, William Hickey and Glenn Shadix.This is one of the most famous animated films in stop motion and was even nominated for the Oscar for Best Visual Effects due to the quality of animation achieved. Tim Burton has talent, especially for films considered strange or out of standards. Horror or mystery themes are rather visited by the director in the form of animations (\"Corpse Bride\" is the most striking example). In this case, it addresses the celebration of Halloween, a popular holiday in the English-speaking countries, which has begun to be observed also in Latin Europe, timidly, for cultural import of the \"mass media\" (in these countries people celebrate the All Saints Day).The script is very good, funny and directly clashes the two holidays. The characters are imaginative and made with great care. The voices were quite well most of the time. Its noticed how Burton were engaged in the project. Very meticulous, he argued for the greatest perfection possible in the film. The sets and visual effects were at the highest level, playing with the most popular objects of Halloween and Christmas. Photography can displease because of low contrast, but I believe it was the best that could be achieved in 1993, and the film, if it were made today, with digital technologies in filming and editing, would have been a rather different picture. The soundtrack, in charge of Danny Elfman, is excellent. He also composed all the songs that are sung in the film. Some of them stays in the ear, others are quite moving, as the songs interpreted by the \"rag doll\" Sally.For all these reasons, this movie is a reference in contemporary animation, and is suitable, in particular, for lovers of the scariest day of the year."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "A pure classic.

It has the definite Tim Burton feel to it, being a mash up of (primarily) Halloween related figures/characters reacting to the sudden knowledge of the holiday of Christmas, which is, of course, the polar opposite holiday in terms of tone etc.I quite enjoyed both the characters and the musical numbers. I quite like that its relatively fast paced at times - its certainly a bit of fun and it looks pretty good in HD. I appreciate well done stop motion animation and this is certainly one of those. If you haven't seen it, I'd say its worth a watch.

Jack is interested in Christmas Town, which he finds unexpectedly, and learns all about Christmas, which he thinks is amazing.
