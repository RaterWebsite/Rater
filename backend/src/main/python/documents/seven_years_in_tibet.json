      "text": "Seven years in Tibet is the incredible true story of Heinrich Harrer, an austrian mountain-climber that accepted some nazi's money, in 1939, to hammer a flag on the top of a himalaya mountain. But the war is declared and he's being kept in prison until he makes his way out with a convicted fellow. There begin his journey through the himalaya until Lhasa,the capital of Tibet. He meets the Dalai-Lama and the movie is about this friendship. It's a really beautiful story about discovering new cultures, new ways of thinking. It's about hospitality and trust in human ressources to be united. Although I would say that it's now really romanticized, it's still one of these movies that will make you feel good if you like to travel."

This is a must see for travelers and explorers, for people who don't explore the world this might not be their cup of tea. Its a movie to sit back and in joy, and not to take so serious it's political history."

      "text": "This was a beautiful movie, worth watching for the photography alone.  It captured an essence of traveling the world and being transformed by it.  The Brad Pitt character made a subtle transformation from being a hard charge Nazi type to a mellow patient guy, with the fall of Tibet as a backdrop.  I felt enriched by this movie.  I was not aware 1 million Tibetans were killed in the religious cleansing by China, that is a bummer."

      "text": "Based on the memoirs of Heinrich Harrer, narrating the failed ascension to Nanda Parbat, his capture as a prisoner of war and the events that led him to meet the future Dalai Lama, an experience that would change their lives, each other. It could have been a little better off not focusing more than it should on the Maoist occupation of Tibet. Still, it is worth the effort to see, especially if you are a fan of Brad Pitt."

C'est aussi l'occasion de revenir sur l'invasion du Tibet par la vermine communiste, l'une des nombreuses hontes du 20\u00e8me si\u00e8cle.L'occasion \u00e9galement de se laisser aller dans une guimauve excessive de la part de Jean-Jacques Annaud avec en prime -on s'en serait pass\u00e9- quelques longueurs dans le r\u00e9cit. Brad Pitt n'est clairement pas \u00e0 la hauteur et mine sensiblement le film qui n'en demandait pas tant. Malgr\u00e9 ces al\u00e9as, le r\u00e9alisateur fran\u00e7ais dispense une mise en sc\u00e8ne pleine de dignit\u00e9, de grandeur et d'\u00e9loquence... et les acteurs (\u00e0 part Brad Pitt) sont excellents."

      "text": "This film follows the course of the German climber Heinrich Harrer, who travels to Tibet in order to climb a mountain. The failure of the attempt and the outbreak of World War II takes him to a prison camp (India was a British colony), from where he manages to flee to Tibet, a neutral country outside of English jurisdiction but very averse to visits from foreigners . However, he is able to enter and settle in the capital, where he meets the young Dalai Lama and helps in his education. Thus begins a great friendship between the two, portrayed in a touching way. The plot has a strong story behind it and is truly interesting, with well-developed moral and historical backgrounds, though it does not focus much on the historical facts but rather on the protagonist's personal connection with what happened there. I felt that the Chinese invasion was almost a footnote in the film, and the movie ended up losing with that absence. Brad Pitt gave life to the protagonist and, despite a reasonable performance, was not totally happy with his character. It seems that he has never really been in the shoes of the climber he plays. David Thewlis had more capacity for his character but, being a secondary character, there was little for the actor. One never comes to understand whether Harrer is a sympathizer of Nazi ideas or whether he was merely a victim of events, like so many Germans who suffered from World War II and who have never reviewed the ideas of the regime. The film explores the whole Tibetan ambiance very well, with its impressive scenery and scenery. Although the film fails to create a mountain epic with an emotive background, it is good enough to merit our attention and does a good job showing a little of what Tibet has been in the past. I'm even surprised that this film has not been nominated for a single Oscar, but maybe political reasons have silenced the Academy."

I was genuinely intrigued by the story of Heinrich Harrer who gets captured by the British in the Himalayas during World War 2, escapes his imprisonment and wanders through Tibet in search for a way home. Still, the story somehow often emphasizes the wrong things, the rivalry between Heinrich and his colleague, for example, or the whole theological business once they arrive in Lhasa and meet the Dalai Lama, all while stuff like the actual War going on or the annexation of Tibet by the Chinese communists is handled in, like, 30 minutes.Nevertheless, this is an important movie, with some beautiful moments at that."

To my pleasant surprise, I ended up caring for the characters and enjoying the details that can be found in this version of Tibet. Some scenes need to be cut out, but give it some time and the film may be worth your investment."
