Ben Stiller's performance as the film's clueless main character was fun to watch and might just be his best role to date. David Duchoveny's cameo was also very funny.

Most of the jokes play off of the character Zoolander being idiotic because of his status as a fashion model. There is an uncomfortable threesome scene, not heavily graphic, but not done well and seems to also be used as a comedic device. If you enjoyed Anchorman or Dodgeball, I would recommend this film for you."

His three best friends are then killed in a freak accident. Seeing his opportunity crazy fashion designer Mugatu plans to brainwash him into murdering the Prime Minister of Malaysia in order to stop new child labor laws being introduced. This being a Ben Stiller Movie it will come as no surprise to learn that the rest of the film is just as ridiculous as the plot suggests. Not every joke completely lands but there are arguably as many laugh out loud moments spread throughout this film as any other I can think of and some excellent cameos, such as David Duchovny as an ex-hand model, also help keep the laughter flowing.    Of course the film won\u2019t be to everyone\u2019s taste but as long as you don\u2019t go into this movie expecting anything other than a slightly bizarre, but very funny, comedy you won\u2019t be disappointed."

Ben Stiller (who wrote and directed this as well) has crafted a hilarious movie. One that does go to goofy extremes to get it's laughs, but succeeds because of it. I also can't help but love the plethora of great cameos.\r My total score for the movie is a 9.3/10."

The characters do make-up for the story's off guide. They may be stupid, but they seem to put a smile on our face, especially Ben Stiller (Derek Zoolander) and Will Ferrell (Mugatu). Even though Ben has his funny moments he also has his retarded moments, but c'mon, you got to enjoy his idiotic performance. Overall, for a short movie and a weird storyline, you'll still enjoy this silly comedy."

I can't believe none of the reviews I read took the movie to task for the unbelievably naive, stupid, ridiculous, misleading, dangerous ideas it espouses - all the while pretending to be a feel-good do-good movie. I cannot fathom the self-serving diatribe against 'sweat shops' in developing countries. Sure, it might benefit some of the lower skilled workers in rich countries if we stopped buying from third world countries, but what happens to those third world country workers after the factories close down??? This movie has an even more outrageous and mind-numbing solution, pass a law in third world countries raising pay for everyone! Oh horray horray! How simple! So all the poor developing countries in the world could become instantly rich and prosperous overnight if their government would only pass a law mandating that everyone should get paid a million dollars a day! Wow! I have seen the light! What a sure and solid grasp of economic fundamentals! And why don't all the governments of the world just do this? Surely it would ensure the undying gratitude and votes of the masses that would ensure you stayed in power forever. You would go down in posterity and people would be naming their grandchildren after you long after you've passed away! So why not? Because they are getting pressure from evil big business? The convenient bogeyman and favourite bad guy of simplistic and morally smug movies from Hollywood. Oh it all makes sense now! Really, movies have their role as entertainment, but when they get into deep social messages - they usually do more harm than good."

      "text": "'Zoolander' is a bit of a guilty pleasure...a movie I shouldn't really like, but ended up surprising me more than I expected.\r Ben Stiller plays an iconic fashion model named Derek Zoolander, who rises from his fame and becomes one of the hottest faces in the country, but then his stardom falls. This is due to his rival named Hansel McDonald (Own Wilson) who ends up winning an award one night that Zoolander thought he was going to win.\r Embarrassed and humiliated from this event, Derek tries to rebuild himself when the eager businessman that is Mugatu (Will Ferrell) wants to train him to assassinate the Malaysian Prime Minister.\r That is the plot, crazy as it may seem, but that is the plot of this dark comedy.\r Stiller directs this movie with a dark and sometimes warped tone, he also plays the character of Zoolander with some kind of dorky, loser feel to him. He is very simple minded and his background includes his dad (played by Jon Voight) hates him, and is ashamed that his son is a male model.\r The funny moments in this film are extremely funny, and while it does go a little off the rails in terms of its plot and writing, this is a dumb comedy where you're meant to have fun and just roll with it."

Well, Ebert was a bit too harsh, I'd say, but this is definitely a disgrace to Hollywood and humankind in general, I'd say. So shallow, so stupid and so over-the-top that it induces vomit. 'Zoolander' is one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. Yes, I will admit it had a few funny scenes, but quite frankly after watching it I just could not control the discomfort I felt. It is just a bad bad film, and is one of the reasons why I've disliked Ben Stiller for years after.
