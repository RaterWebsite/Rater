      "text": "It had a lot of potential, but halfway in and every thing just became more and more predictable up to the point of the worst ending they could've gone with. The not so surprise twist! Only netflix would give this a number 1 spot*Edit: I find it sketchy that the positive reviews are from people writing long reviews with big words and little, if any grammatical errors. It seems fake. F these phoneys."

      "text": "Well, if their intent was to make ever inch of my body contort with creepiness vibes \u2014 they were successful!   The horror component of this film is definitely more the psychological, instead of the jump-scares.  It taps into those primal fears that most of us ladies don\u2019t like to think about, being sexually targeted by a man we are suppose to be able to trust.  He\u2019s like the male version of a siren, so beautiful and is leading us to our death.(Spoiler alert) That shower scene was probably one of the most uncomfortable scenes I\u2019ve EVER witnessed in a film, which was preceded by a scene on a boat that I \u2014omgeee \u2014I don\u2019t even want to think about.  I audibly gasped. Umm, John licks something, that I\u2019ve NEVER seen in cinema.Then there\u2019s that ending.  WHAT?!  That\u2019s all I get?  What happens?  I. Need. More.  I then went looking for answers, and I read this Q&A with the director. He said , \u201cthe final scene was one of the earliest shots in my head.  For me it answers the who, what, where, and why of our mystery.  Part of the why, for instance, is distinguished by a physical trait shared by all the subjects in the shot.\u201d   Then I watched the film again \u2014 and this movie is really nuanced.  Once you see that detail and a few others you finally get what John is doing, and where Libby is headed. I\u2019ll let you see it for yourself.   Overall, great acting and a visually beautiful film.  Ahhhh \u2014 Give me a sequel!!"

It made you think from the beginning and it was different than any other movie, it kept making you think it was like others but then had a twist. The location was gorgeous too, natural setting with beautiful views. I hope that this director/writer comes out with more movies, it\u2019s just what we needed for 2020!"

Don\u2019t miss out on this gem. It\u2019ll definitely be a movie to watch twice, three times, four times, and more... We want more from new dir. Braden Duemmler!"

      "text": "I really enjoyed this. It felt like something fresh in a genre that is awash with \u201csame old.\u201d While much of the plot just unfolds in a pretty straightforward fashion, there are still some interesting concepts. However, the very end, literally the last second, doesn\u2019t quite make it all the way to a complete thought. This is made especially so as the acting and plot start to lean a little more to the campy side near the climax. The pacing is a little strange and in many ways I was hoping this slow burn would have had more to offer length wise. It could have had another fifteen minutes in the runtime without it feeling tired. There are some silly horror troupes here and there, but tension is built up nicely as things get stranger. The music is great and with such a small cast it\u2019s a very impressive sci-fi horror/thriller. I highly recommend it."

      "text": "This movie was strange and not in a good way. It was very cliche in many aspects and very corny as well. I managed to watch all of it but I had to watch Youtube in between on my phone. Is not really good at what is trying to do. If you want something scary that is good? watch \"The Hole in the Ground\" from 2019 that movie nailed it very good movie. What Lies Below was pretty lame it tries but it doesn't come close to succeeding at all lol a low 6 out of 10 for me."
