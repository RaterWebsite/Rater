I will also say it bears being watched multiple times in order to fully grasp the imagery and plot to the best degree. I enjoy movies that you need to and want to watch more than once to understand. I gave it a 10 because it is my new favorite movie and will be for a while until something else comes along...and with so many of the movies in the past years being just the opposite (shallow, uninteresting and overdone) it may be some time."

It calls into question the intelligence of the people writing about it, particularly those who say Aranofsky's 'reach exceeds his grasp.' This is a complicated and assured film, one without easy answers. Everyone said these same types of criticisms about Kubrick films. The critical lambasting here just goes to show how little we expect from our films, how shocked we are when we're challenged by them, and how negatively we react when we can't understand them. Don't listen to the media static - see this movie."

It's hard for me to understand why so many critics are panning this movie. I mean, with movies like \"Spiderman 3\" scoring better on Metacritic than \"The Fountain\" I am left scratching my head. Do the critics hold Arnofsky to a different standard? My opinion is that with all of the trash that is heaped into theaters these days, we should appreciate when a movie like this comes along. Some may find it flawed, I don't doubt. But should we not give credit where it's due? Anyway, I thought it was a true work of art and will watch it repeatedly."

Color and texture come together beautifully; the dark, rainy Mayan jungle, the snow-covered fields of modern America, and the Orion Nebula's golden nuclear rain are breathtaking to behold, especially in HD. Unfortunately the film tries to answer questions that some people go to church for, so those with strongly-held beliefs about the nature of life, death, and God might end the film feeling confused, threatened, even offended. Those of us who, like Aranofsky, are looking to reconcile the illusory conflicts between science and spirituality will likely find it an intensely rewarding experience."

      "text": "I was lucky enough today to be able to catch The Fountain at the film festival downtown. To start off, I have always been a huge Aronofsky fan, I introduced my friends to Pi and Requiem, and they are two of my favourite movies. From The Fountain's inception in the early 2000's, I have followed all of its foibles and developmental issues. The script was originally approved with Pitt and Blanchett to star in the leading roles. Pitt left to film Troy and the project was thrown on the back burner. In 2004 the film re-emerged with a budget half of the original and was cast with Jackman and Weisz. As is expected when one follows things for such a long time, excitement builds and there is always the wish for what you are about to experience to be spectacular. This is one of those instances where one is awestruck and that excitement has not been crushed by the feeling of disappointment. Without a doubt, The Fountain by Darren Aronofsky is one of the best films I have seen this year, if not one of the best films of the decade. Future viewings and time will tell if the latter holds true. I'm not even sure where to begin, essentially the plot is set in three different time periods, with Jackman playing a conquistador, a modern scientist/doctor, and a intergalactic voyager all while trying to find a way for Weisz to live as she is terminally ill. The visuals in The Fountain are dazzling. The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen in my life. The shots are all perfect and the lighting immaculate. Aronofsky seems to have gone with mostly centered shots, which may sound dull at first glance, however, they most definitely are not. It is not as gimmicky or manipulative as Requiem or even Pi were, but the visuals could take your breath away. They are that stunning. To make things even more impressive, they chose not to use CGI for much of the film and instead filmed chemical reactions and formations on petri dishes and were able to extrapolate that into fantastical imagery. As far as the acting goes, this is without a doubt the best work of Hugh Jackman and while Rachel Weisz is also very good, it is mainly Jackman that carries the movie as he is the lead role. I actually enjoyed the rest of the supporting cast even in their small roles. Specifically, Ellen Burstyn, Mark Margolis, and Cliff Curtis. The musical score is just another thing on its own. Clint Mansell, having collaborated in the past for both Pi and Requiem for a Dream creates a most ethereal musical score. The Kronos Quartet, who had the theme song for the movie Requiem for a Dream, entitled Lux Aeterna, and Scottish post rockers Mogwai fill out most of this blissful soundtrack. The music meshes wonderfully with the movie even though there are, three different periods so to speak. Furthermore, the explosions in music, re: Mogwai and the whole post-rock genre completely gels and interlaces with the revelations experienced and ideas expressed within the film. I won't reveal too much as to what unfolds in the movie, however, it is a beautiful story of love, and what one discovers about himself and the world in this quest of undying love. There are so many facets, so many nooks and cranies that this film dares to explore all at once in such majestic fashion it is truely unbelievable. It connects emotionally with the viewer, my heart started palpitating at various points and near the very end my eyes watered up for a good five minutes. Aronofsky explores my ideas and themes in this movie, though the main ones I think are acceptance and duality. The movie is incessantly deep and heavy and therefore requires repeated viewings for sure. Those of you who have seen Pi, this is in many ways a sister movie to that. Just as Pi attempts to understand natural surroundings and life through mathematics, The Fountain follows suit but on the path of spirituality and philosophy. In closing, I still require many hours to ponder the ideas in this movie, in fact I have been watching the trailer nonstop since I got home. Aronofsky possesses immense testicular fortitude to be able to make a film like this for wide release. He has my utmost respect for attempting such an ambitious film that has come across to me at least as highly successful."

There were two specific moments in particular, where all the people sitting directly around me in the theatre started laughing. One of those moments, was the climax. Had there not been \"intellectuals\", artists, art-house filmgoers, mainstream filmgoers or immature emotionally undeveloped people in the audience, I would have enjoyed it even more without people around me laughing at the brilliance onscreen. That being said, it definitely felt like Aronofsky deliberately went out of the way to make a film that very specifically panders to not a single demographic or crowd. It completely depends on the person. But generally, I think most artists intellectuals and art-house cinemaphiles (and especially critics) will absolutely loathe this movie, because it is relentlessly emotional, and completely unashamed. But the themes and concepts, the imagery, it is so cyclical, and all fits perfectly together. I can easily wait 6 more years for Aronofsky's next film, because then I know it'll be at least half as good as this incredibly moving piece of work."

For me though this movie was a lot more than that. It is flawed for sure. But the essence of the message is something that resounds deeply within me. Gorgeous art direction and underpinned by a sumptuos score by Clint Mansell, this film is a must for film fanatics. It feels much like the personal movies of the 60's. It explores themes of love, death and immortality whilst touching on old testament stories such as the Tree of Life from the garden of eden (the other tree was the tree of knowledge that Adam and Eve ate from). If The Fountain doesn't leave you chattering about the meaning of life you probably shouldn't have gone to see this movie in the first place. It is cerebral. It is challenging. But ultimately very rewarding. Did I mention it was beautiful to look at. Check out my full Aronofsky review over at tweenbetween.blogspot.com"

But when a movie, that truly reaches beyond the conventions of the typical Hollywood blockbuster finally comes forward, it is shunned, as people flee back to their tried and true formulas and trilogies. This it seems is the story of the Fountain. The film is truly a work of art, combining some of the most beautiful cinematography and music yet seen in a movie theater with an idea that is so simple, so common place, but at the same time so utterly life changing. Like the theater of Brecht, the Fountain is not so much about the narrative, but how what we are seeing communicates to us. It is for this reason that i feel the movie has had such a bad showing. The ideas its presents are so raw, so completely human, that it is hard to see them presented to us in this fashion. The ideas, for for average movie going joe, are to big and at the same time, close to heart to contemplate in a movie theater. For this reason, the Fountain should ONLY be seen by those who are able to watch a film without everything being spelled out for them, and by those intelligent enough to analyse the films message and how it is conveyed. Is truly one of the most original, innovative and moving films for a long time. 10/10"

Now I could easily call this movie pretentious yet at the same time without that pretense, there wouldn't be much to see here. My only complaints of the Fountain were the excessive amounts of scene changes which I felt were not properly executed, and the poor script that neither worked for the characters or for the audience. Those mistakes alone take this down a notch from being truly exceptional but a movie of this magnitude deserves to be seen provided you are willing to go into it with an open mind."

      "text": "This movie involves some of my most favorite themes and interests - the tree of life, the Mayans, scientists, new medicines discovered from plants in the rainforest, books, the acceptance of death, the fight against death, hope, peace, and space travel. One of the primary dynamics in the movie is the contrast between the man who is spending all his time and energy trying to find a way to keep the woman alive. One wonders if perhaps his time was better spent by spending time with her, listening to her, loving her, and just being with her in her final days. To me that is the crux of the movie, and I felt it deeply - her acceptance of death, and his fight against it (and essentially against her in a way). I have not stopped thinking about this movie since I watched it, and I absolutely love it. For me, and I understand for many others, it is the epitome of beauty and depth. And yes, in the end some things didn't add up, and the \"lotus position\" was hokey for sure - meditation does not involve any physical posture, it is an inner state of being (but how to show that visually? Then again, the first time I watched the movie, I thought the space bubble was in fact the man's inner state of being, portrayed visually, and was a not a \"real\" place but a representation of what was in his head...who knows...). But the heart was there and the intentions were good, even if the portrayal of the themes was not perfect - but who has done this and these themes before any better? I must say also though that my own life experiences and background and interests had a profound effect on the way I received this movie. So many of the visuals, the themes, and the ideas are so embedded in me that if the movie were based on some other visuals and themes, I might not have really liked it at all. (Botany, Medicine, Anthropology, Space Travel, Meditation, and the death of a Beloved)."

If you have an open mind, you should be prepared for a beautiful and moving work of art that features two actors at the top of their form. The central theme is transcendence, and although the film plays with three time periods, representing superstition, science, and spirituality as a symbol of mankind's progression (in a hopeful, Nitzschean sense), it is not bound to that kind of structure. Ultimately, it transcends space and time to remind us of why we are who we are: because of our undying souls. The symbolism may be Buddhist in nature, but the films' essence is as timeless and non-religious as one can hope for. To all you critics: I sympathize. You have a lot of work to do, and to encounter a film that leaves you scratching your heads must be frustrating as hell. But don't pan something just because you don't understand it."

I have watched this masterpiece about 4 to 5 times and every time I watched it I would discover new ideas, metaphors, symbolisms, realizing more and more clearly what message the director is trying to convey. This aspect alone points to the artistry of the movie. Music of Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, Chopin works precisely the same way. This masterpieces of music grow on us over the years and every time we comeback to them with new experiences we discover something new in them. Thats what makes piece of art work timeless. On the top of this Aranovsky is a visual artist his movie is a visual Odyssey that adds to the viewers imaginative delight and conveyance of the essence of the movie. One examples: the ring that gets lost, when his wife collapses and he walks in circle waiting, to the glass sphere he is traveling in, to the tattooed lines on his body that circle around like the trees rings, to finally the the being that enters the (cicrcle) the sphere of light to finish the journey. This are all symbolic representations of reincarnation and repetitive events of our lives that just manifest themselves in different transmutations. In addition this movie is a rare gem because of the topic the director chose. Most of movies now a day focus on violence and the dark side of the human nature and even the so called good characters have very little good in them. Here Aranovsky portrays many faucets of human nature but the strongest highlight is the human spirit the soul of the human being. Its about our highest possible expression, transcending our physical illusion that are so real to us and entering our final stage of enlightenment that sheds the mortal suffering because of the realization of the highest truth about our true nature. In my book Aranovsky is one of the best and most brilliant movie directors alive. I have seen all his movies and when I went to see the fountain it was because of his earlier movies that I saw. With every movie he created his artistic expression is truly transcending to new heights. Mr. Aranovsky please keep creating and delighting your audience. Cheers."
