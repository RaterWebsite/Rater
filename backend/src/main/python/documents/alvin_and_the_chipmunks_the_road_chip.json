Dave leaves with his new girlfriend leaving the boys with a babysitter cutting down their ability to perform\u00a0 .Yet,the girls who are the same age are partying alone with no adult supervision down\u00a0 in LA .The girls must have proven their mature level is twice as high as The boys .\r \u00a0 Dave's\u00a0 new girlfriends\u00a0 son is picking on the boys until he gets to know them better which is why the boys want to get rid of him and his mother so they take off after Dave thinking he is going to marry his mother after finding a ring in his bag .The main point of this movie to show what a great dad Dave is\u00a0 .So they fill it with potty jokes and chase Dave ending it with a special song just for him.Wait isn't this the same dad who sent 3 teenage\u00a0 girl's alone to LA to party without\u00a0 adult supervision\u00a0 .So now is when you have to remember the girls don't belong to Dave and he was\u00a0 just being the nice guy giving them a place to crash for awhile.

This  kind of gives you the yawn factor .They had a teenage boy who is as boring as that strange female Zoe in the chip wrecked movie which they could had less of .At least in that one the 6 chipmunks some up covered her up kind of  .In this one there is only 3 Chipmunks trying to cover it up so it is harder to do .\r The jokes were your normal Chipmunk jokes Alvin not as funny as in the past movies .They could have toned him up a little .One thing that always stuck at me is in the cartoon the kids were in grade school maybe middle school in this they are in high school someone didn't pay attention to the original when they put that detail in .I  think the new Nick cartoon with some of the original voice actors was  a better go then creating the 4 chipmunk movie or going back to the cartoon like they are doing with Smurfs 3 maybe it would  have been a choice all around .Dave was pretty good .They could have done without making this one or made the Chipette neighbors instead of  tossing them out of most of the movie or living in the treehouse so they be more involved in the movie maybe then it would have been better ."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "What can I say except for this movie was awful! Did you guys seriously expect me to say that this was a good movie. It's not even so bad it's good it's just so bad it's cringey. That's one word to use while describing this movie \u201cCringey\u201d. Some of the jokes were so bad/painful that I would get frustrated. Most notably the Baby Got Back cover. If you couldn't tell, this is a road trip movie where to have to get to point A to point B in a certain amount of time and the chipmunks are doing this to stop Dave from marrying his new girlfriend and prevent getting an annoying step brother Miles. So, they are supposed to gain a meaningful relationship along the way, right? Well, not exactly. There relationship doesn't grow overtime. It just goes from I hate you to I love, just like that... I'm not even exaggerating that. That is literally how it happens. The acting was god awful. Except for Jason Lee, he was decent. But, everyone else, especially Bella Thorne couldn't act for anything! I don't think even the cheap cameos (Redfoo, probably got him on for like 10 cents) could save this movie. In the end, listen to my good friend and go see Star Wars: The Force Awakens instead.

It's a fairly standard setup with a very familiar plot and moral themes of family. It may be rather generic, but at least it doesn't spend a lot of time shoving a lot of pop culture down the kid's throats.\r The musical numbers are still there accompanied by a lot of dancing. However there aren't as many as the previous movies had, so in that area the movie is mercifully toned down. The focus just really is on the laughs and story.\r Yes, the humor is juvenile as all get out. However outside of some questionable Mardi Gras antics, it's all completely harmless. The type of movie you can sit the kids in front of and not have to worry about what they're hearing or seeing. Depending on your tolerance for humor aimed at young children, you may even be able to watch it with them.\r If you and/or your children didn't enjoy any of the previous Chipmunk movies, then don't expect this one to change that. It does tone down on a lot of the more obnoxious or annoying elements found in some of the previous films, but for the most part it's still very much a Chipmunks movie. It's rather disposable children's entertainment. Perfect for a rental or something to keep the kids busy for a bit. It's cute, sweet, and fairly energetic. A decent movie for the young children in your house. Not all parents may like it, but it's not really for them anyway. It sets out to entertain kids and I believe it will do just that.\r 7.2/10"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I've seen Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip, and I swear, it's one of the most underrated movies of all time; boasting a fast and energetic pace that will keep its audiences hooked until the very end more so than the previous Alvin movies, this is definitely worth watching! There are a handful of touchy and thoughtful moments, with the ending making me tear up quite a bit. The Chipmunks and the Chipettes also look significantly better, with brighter colors working in their favor. As for the laughs, they are both numerous and harmless, so there's no reason to hate the chipmunks in the first place. The songs are catchy, and some of them stand out a lot! All in all, I feel that the Alvin movies greatly benefit from having a fast pace, so the creators should keep up with what they excel at. However, one small problem I have with this movie is that the Chipettes aren't shown all that much, which is understandable, but I do hope they are more involved with the Chipmunks in the future films. They've been around since The Squeakquel, so they should also be popping up on the theatrical release posters. I suppose it's a little bit of a nit-pick, but I would like to see some more sweet-talk between them because it's SO cute. Other than that, I absolutely loved this movie, and I recommend it to anyone and everyone.

I hate the haters because they don't give a crud about family bonding or messages in these films at all. all the haters and critics give a crud about is the so called \"Terrible CGI\" and the \"ruining of childhood\". if it was that bad to you, why ask for it, then hate on it? People should really stop complaining and hating and just look at the good parts of the film, especially the family bond. It breaks my heart to know that people ignore these heartwarming family moments, and only watch it to make the people who made this feel like idiots. to be honest, I don't think the CGI was perfect! it still kept that cute, furry chipmunk look. also, the ruining of childhood thing is a lie, because it's still the chipmunks, they just changed the looks, voices, and made up not one, but 4 amazing story lines that all line up with the family bond. Guys, you should really lighten up and pay more attention to the good parts of the film instead of bashing out on it when you asked for this to be made. for those creators of these 4 films, I give you my support, and continue to love the chipmunks, no matter how old I am and no matter how much people judge. make a 5th film, and I'll be the first one in the theaters.

They're stupid but they kinda work, at least in terms of what their intended purpose is.The casting is quite something.

Later I thought there was a cat locked up here because when he walked with the protagonists he walked a little slow with a little sadness on his face, I don't know if he acts well without realizing it. girls don't appear much in the movie but if they didn't notice it during the movie it gives us that almost profound loneliness of being without them when we get to them it's like being home again but when Brittany looks and touches her shoulder ah alvin, now that I realize they traveled not because of Dave, but because of the girls that Alvin traveled for Brittany, that's why Brit looked at him that loving way.(BAD: James Suggs is the worst villain and cannot pass ah lan Hawke, he will always be the best and most beloved of all.(Ideas: I would like the following sequel to directly address the love between the 6 characters, in addition to the fact that they sing and dance. Another would be a world tour that would be more extravagant with Russian and Latin American actors. Another is first not for Kids, it would be for a younger group set on Halloween.
