Sure it is an old movie now but still it has lavish production design. Everything is created in full detail, good acting, nice injections shots of humor, fascinating fights, excellent editing and one unfuzzy direction from Anderson. Plus the exotic locations. Maybe the story is not serious-which it isn't-but it is presented in a way that makes the movie serious.

My most favorite MK character, Johnny Cage was funny and awesome. The best part was Goro looked great! The animatronics with the face and arms were fantastic that time in 1995.

Mortal Kombat atleast was wachable ."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Cheesy martial arts fun. It's got overacting, plenty of goofy one-liners, and over-the-top action galore. The plot falls short thanks to simplicity and a lack of focus so the movie just comes off as one long fight scene. That's not really a bad thing. Even with the crappy CGI and bad special effects the movie is still a treat to look at thanks to the fact that it looks almost exactly like the videogames it's based on.\r Admittedly if this wasn't based off of the Mortal Kombat games it probably wouldn't have been watchable. Had they have gone with original characters and themes the issues the movie has wouldn't have been so forgivable. It really is the faithfulness to the source material that keeps it afloat. The only thing it is missing are the series signature gory finishers. The action is noticeably tame in comparison to the games.\r Still, fans of the series should definitely check this out. It might not be the most high-quality film out there, but it's enjoyable and probably the best movie adaption a videogame series like Mortal Kombat could hope for. Even if you are unfamiliar with the games it's based on the action and setting should still keep you entertained provided you like martial arts and don't mind putting up with all of the cheese.\r I give \"Mortal Kombat\" an 8.5/10."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This is by far the best video game movie ever made!The plot is enjoyable,the fighting is awesome,the acting is good a little cheesy but good.Every fan of MK will be pleased with this movie!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Mortal Kombat is still to this day the greatest video game-to-movie adaptation yet!

I was unfortunately dragged to see this instead of some other cool movie at the time that was R-rated because my best friend was asked to take his younger siblings along with him to the movie theater and they were not old enough to see an R-rated movie. So, like a trooper I stuck with to endure this movie while our more scumbag friends ran off to see a better movie. Going in, I didn't have any expectations really. I had played countless hours of Mortal Kombat the video game in the arcade while in high school, and that was a cool game, so I thought, hey, this might not be so bad. Man, was I wrong. Now why would you take a video game filled with extreme graphic violence and then try to turn it into a movie for a General audience aimed at young children? Because you're an idiot without any common sense, that's why! The only \"fatality\" is when one of the fighters stupidly slips and falls off the side of the mountain, there is no blood, no gore, nothing. This was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. And this is supposed to be an action movie? I'd rather watch somebody play the video game than watch this movie, seriously, watching somebody play the video game is way more entertaining!

Though, it still has numerous flaws, as expected.  If memory serves me well, it is the 4th highest grossing film based off of a video game ever.  The presentation of the characters were hit or miss.  I do like Christopher Lambert's interpretation of Raiden, rather being wise and a little cocky than just the usual all-knowing thunder god.  The action sequences were just okay, but when it came to any fight scenes with Goro, boy did it look clumsy.  I know stop-motion can be unusual to work with, but I've seen more believable stuff from Monty Python.  Obviously, this film did no favors for any of the actors' careers.  Lambert was already established with the Highlander films, Robin Shou did Beverly Hills Ninja with Chris Farley and had a small role in DOA: Dead or Alive, and Bridgette Wilson was in Billy Madison with Adam Sandler....haven't heard anything from any of them since.  A couple of the martial artists, like Chris Casamassa who played Scorpion and Hakim Alston who played Liu Kang's first opponent in the tournament, were on a short-live kids show called WMAC Masters and haven't really done anything since, unless you count what they do in their lives as martial artists.

At the first cutscene when a boy called Chan Kang was killed by Shang Tsung, I was confused but I soon realised that it was a flashback so I continued the movie. The plot is based on the first Mortal Kombat, but then I was thrown off with the fact that there were characters from Mortal Kombat 2. The plot was not constructed or written very well because at the ending when Shao Kahn appears, I was thinking \"Which Mortal Kombat game are they basing the movie on? Mortal Kombat or Mortal Kombat 2??\"\r I liked the fight scenes in the game with my favorite being Johnny Cage vs Scorpion and I also liked some of the jokes that certain characters make in the movie. The funniest part of the movie for me was when Johnny Cage punched Goro in the nuts. The environments were awesome as well for a 90's movie. However, the awful dialogue and the acting that ranged from bad like Christopher Lambert (Raiden) to hilaribad like Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa (Shang Tsung) who was laughably awful at the role. Memorable quotes from Shang Tsung included \"Your soul is MINE!\", \"Fatality!\" and \"Finish him/her!\". And let's not forget his weird screw face that he does in certain parts of the movie!!!

With a bit of improvements and adding of fatalities (Unique feature of the Mortal Kombat games) this would be a cult classic of its genre. It is based on the famous Mortal Kombat fighting video game series. Which had about 18 games at the time of writing and sold more than 25 million copies. There were 2 unique features of the games: 1. They used blue screen to capture real life actors. 2.The games gave you fatalities that are over the top gory executions of your enemies. It was what made the games popular. It was the hot topic on the school yard and the stuff of legends back then;-). Back to the movie: They capture the essence of the games. There is a fighting tournament that determinate the fate of the earth (realm). It was set up to avoid a war as an evil immortal ruler of another realm wants to takeover earth (The term assimilation / merge is closer if I think about it). The best martial artist of earth fight against their best fighters. When earth realm has lost 10 times in a row all will be lost. This times it is serious as earth has lost the last 9 tournaments. The strength of the movie is the good balance between seriousness and taking itself not serious. If this was intentional then this is magnificent and should be praised. Then there is the good humour. I didn't expect to have this many good laughs in this movie. The cast is well chosen. Robin Shou is an incredible Liu Kang. Practical an uncut diamond that will grow in his role.  Linden Ashby nails the role of Johnny Cage. An actor who is also a martial artist that is not taken serious because of his acting role. He is also the stereo type of an American that has the cultural sensibility of a brick (but is a hero underneath). Bridgette Wilson is a fitting Sonja Blade first but a decline for the later parts (Script wise she got demoted / Not the actress fault). The fan favourites Ninjas Scorpion and Sub Zero are underused outside of combat. Christopher Lambert as Raiden should be a mismatch but his acting is so over the top hilarious and entertaining that he became a highlight. The villains are awesome. Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa performance as Shang Tsung puts a smile on your face. He likes to be the bad guy and plotter. Goro (A clay model) is an intimidating opponent that lives to crush his enemies. A martial arts / fighting movie is only good when it has good battles. This movie delivers a lot of good and memorable battles. The best are Johnny Cage vs Scorpion / Goro followed by Liu Kang vs Sub Zero / Reptile and the final battle. The only mismatch is Sonja Blade vs Kano. It would be good but Sonja looks really skinny / inferior in the scenes (Could fix it with better cuts). It must also mention the score. The Mortal Kombat theme is as energizing and awesome today as it was back then. The rest of the score helps to deliver the atmosphere of the movie. Overall this is a good video game adaptation and an enjoyable movie. The main critique from others is pointless. It is not a cultural valuable or intellectual movie.

I feel it was more the fault of the script rather than the cast (for the most part), like the special effects, it had '90 s' written all over it. Tagawa, the actor everyone know though few can name managed to pull off the serious side to an otherwise comedic role if handed to another. What I did like were two of the fight scenes which the original MK soundtrack complimented so perfectly and charged our anticipation, alas it didn't last long. In the end it's not a bad movie but just a sign of the time's limits as well as extensive boundaries in film. You can just tell straight off if a certain production have a cultist following, and this does for good reason. It does have little nods to the game but nothing overly satisfying.
