      "text": "A film that breaks the conventions of a biopic by taking a real person and placing them in a real life event while being abstract and looking at how the person thought instead of how the people around her felt. It\u2019s everything I wanted it to be and more. I have to say that Kristen Stewart\u2019s performance as Princess Diana is absolutely amazing. It\u2019s my favorite performance of the year so far and absolutely deserves the Oscar for Best Actress next year. Stewart is unrecognizable here and I loved that. All of the other performances were great as well especially from Timothy Spall and Sally Hawkins. The costumes are on point here. Each of them helps contribute to Diana\u2019s mood and tone of the overall scene which was amazing. The costumes help us understand Diana\u2019s mood and what she is thinking without directly telling us. The direction, cinematography, and writing are all amazing as well. Pablo Larra\u00edn does an amazing job at showing and not telling us Diana\u2019s mood unless it was absolutely necessary and his style contributes greatly to the final product. The writing does a fantastic job at showing us someone who is crumbling under the weight of being a member of the Royal family and feeling the need to just run. The cinematography looks stellar here. It looks like a film that came straight out of the 1990s in a good way. The music has a jazzy feel to it which helps us show the impulsiveness of Diana in this film. I also loved how we get almost dream sequences here where we see how Diana is feeling and what she wants to do. Those scenes feel very uncomfortable at points and it works beautifully. All of these qualities come together beautifully to show us the inside of Diana Spencer. Please go check this out when you can but know it\u2019s a much more different kind of biopic."

      "text": "Director Pablo Larrain (the \u201cJackie\u201d biopic) and Writer Steven Knight (\u201cLocke,\u201d \u201cSerenity,\u201d \u201cEastern Promises\u201d) offer fair warning.  In the opening moments of \u201cSpencer,\u201d a vanity card tells us this will be \u201ca fable from a true tragedy.\u201d  We are fully aware that this portrait of Princess Diana will not be a by-the-numbers recitation of historical facts.  But there is scant preparation for a film that unfolds much more like a fever dream.All of the action takes place in December, 1991, at Sandringham, the estate where the royal family spends Christmas each year.  Diana and Prince Charles are eleven years into their marriage, with their breathlessly-followed separation occurring exactly one year later.Some of the film is clearly reality-based.  Diana\u2019s bulimia, which is depicted quite graphically, is well-known.  It\u2019s also accurate that all royal gatherings are highly structured events, down to the specific outfit changes required of Diana for each meal. (There\u2019s a rack of dresses with labels indicating when each piece of clothing must be worn.)  The ever-presence of Camilla Parker-Bowles is similarly reality-based.  In this case, the creative team has Charles giving identical pearl necklaces to Diana and Parker-Bowles as Christmas gifts.  (The giving of identical gifts did happen on another occasion, but involved different jewelry.)Some of the film is clearly imagined.  Knight\u2019s script delves deep into Diana\u2019s psyche.  What emerges is a series of hallucinations, culminating with imaginary conversations between Diana and Anne Boleyn, with whom she identifies.  It all comes together to form a searing depiction of a woman in psychic agony.  This tone of unrest, dread and impending doom is accentuated by the powerful score of Jonny Greenwood (\u201cPhantom Thread,\u201d several Radiohead music videos).  Greenwood\u2019s work underscores Diana\u2019s anxiety, fear and desperation as he moves from discordant jazz to simple piano melodies to other musical idioms, all without a single false note.What doesn\u2019t work is the royal family as anti-hero.  Diana\u2019s single interaction with the Queen is cordial and instructive (the Queen observes that all the members of the royal family are \u201cjust currency\u201d for an insatiable press).  Diana\u2019s major conversation with Prince Charles, while devoid of warmth, is not overtly threatening.  The \u201coppressive\u201d demands of the royal family as a group seem to center on the request that Diana show up on time for dinner.  While it\u2019s starkly evident that Diana is consistently being controlled and monitored, the dreaded \u201cother\u201d that is clearly crushing Diana never comes into clear focus.What makes this film a must-see is Kristen Stewart.  With \u201cOn the Road,\u201d \u201cThe Clouds of Sils Maria\u201d and various other serious films, Stewart has demonstrated her intention to become a versatile, multi-faceted actress.  \u201cSpencer\u201d reflects the culmination of all that hard work and development.  While showing an uncanny ability to reflect Diana\u2019s mannerisms, gait and facial expressions, Stewart moves well beyond mimicry to owning and inhabiting this role in a way that\u2019s powerfully mesmerizing.After viewing \u201cSpencer,\u201d my feelings about Princess Diana were essentially unchanged.  I still wish I had deeper insight into an iconic figure who was publicly kind, thoughtful and accessible while privately disintegrating."

      "text": "It seems like the life and times of Princess Diana are on the top of the mind for the entertainment industry. The most recent season of \"The Crown\" depicted Princess Diana joining the House of Windsor and all of the turmoil surrounding. There is also a Broadway musical called Diana. Guess what that's about. Now, Princess Diana gets the big screen treatment in Spencer, but it's not one of those cradle-to-grave biopics but something more specific. I took in this rather inscrutable drama at a theater near me, and here's how it went.Pablo Larrain's Spencer sets the tone with the following title card: \"a fable of a true tragedy.\" Essentially, as much as this is a depiction of Princess Diana on a fateful Christmas holiday in the 1991, it is very clearly a fictionalized account of this time. In the beginning, Diana arrives late and alone to the Queen's Sandringham Estate after the rest of the family has already settled in. It seems Diana's goal is just to get through one last weekend with the House of Windsor before her separation and ultimate divorce from the Prince of Wales. Spencer depicts the mental and physical struggles that Diana goes through enduring this holiday isolated and dictated to by a family that doesn't want her.Kristen Stewart gives a remarkable performance as this version of Diana. Her look is an approximation of what we've seen of Diana - the wig, the makeup and the clothes. Stewart has mannerisms, a voice and accent that suggest the princess, but don't amount to mimicry. Stewart does her best to embody, as well as convey, the difficulty that must have been plaguing Diana at this time. She is the reason to see Spencer as no other actors really register in the film. It is a one woman show, and it's a good show at that.If there is another star, it has to be Pablo Larrain's direction. Now, I can't entirely get on board with the whole show, but Larrain definitely was going for something different. For the most part, he achieved it. Who would have considered this biopic to be almost a horror film or a psychological thriller? It was really shocking at points when things you think you saw are maybe not exactly what they seem to be. I don't want to get too spoiler-y because it is good to be caught off guard. Some may not appreciate the flights of fancy that pop up throughout, but I thought it makes what is otherwise a well-trodden subject interesting again.Side Note: the score by Jonny Greenwood is so fascinating and discordant that it gets distracting at times.Spencer is another in an ever-growing line of Princess Diana depictions. Pablo Larrain takes some strange chances telling this story and attempts to get inside the head of the troubled princess with varying degrees of success. Kristen Stewart's performance is stellar and is worth a viewing. Grab a bowl of popcorn for a matinee of Spencer."

Shot on film in 4:3, the movie refers several times to 'The Shining'. The hotel corridors, the cellars, the kitchens, the cold room, the majordomo, the bathroom scene with the old woman, a green bathroom similar to 'The Shining', the nightmarish sequences, the escape in the cold night... Everything is more or less related to 'The Shining' or 'Barry Lyndon' for the aristocratic side, and Kirsten Stewart's interpretation is great, enhancing the quality.

      "text": "Diana Spencer is a tragic figure. Basically everything that happened to her in her adult life was tragic. From the miserable life she had with the English royal family, to the overwhelming media harassment she received after her divorce, which culminated in her death trying to escape the paparazzi. And now, after so long since her death. Her tragic death. Her figure and her presence continue to be exploited.In this case, well actually in all the current cases that represent these people, I find it incredibly surprising.I say this because Diana Spencer had to be a perfect princess for the royal family. And nowadays, Diana Spencer has to be the perfect figure for all the people who have mythologized her. Pablo Larra\u00edn plays in that arena with his newest film. Basically evoking everything he did in Jackie, but for some reason it's always been said that you can't use the same trick with an audience that already expects or knows it, and Spencer is basically the romanticized version of a series of events that the screenwriter decides to imagine in his own way, giving all the spotlight to his protagonist, but leaving aside any substantial elements at its core.And yes, Kristen Stewart even with her bad accent gives what is perhaps the best performance of her career, but once you notice all the nuances that she was able to impregnate into her performance, there's no more, because the story doesn't give her something else to do.Everything is speculative. And the film defends that with its \" A fable from a true tragedy\"It would be so much more interesting if this had not already been so thoroughly explored.Spencer is a well-made film, I can't deny that, but the setting and the style can't make up for the lack of a better narrative, and more than anything, a different dynamic.Larra\u00edn plays the same notes through the whole thing, and never wanders outside the box, so he delivers a correct but inconsequential film.It will certainly give Stewart the Oscar because we know how the business works, but beyond that, I'm not taking anything with me from this fable.Spencer doesn't humanize Princess Diana, it does something much worse. It idealizes her."

If you knew nothing about Diana going in, i'd be surprised if you came out liking her. The plot tries and fails to cast it as a trapped bird wanting to be free. Instead showing us that she's an extremely bratty person and there's literally nothing trapping her in this. I genuinely cannot see what people find enjoyable in this film, it's not haunting, it's not spellbinding..it's a genuine attempt at sabotaging Diana in the guise of a tragic story."
