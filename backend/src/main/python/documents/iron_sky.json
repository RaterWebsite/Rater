I did like the Iron sky alot. It was more comedy than action and it was very funny at some part and it did end a bit too early."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Iron Sky is a bit of a mixed bag, some may hate it and some may love it. The humor is done pretty well and some of the jokes and/or parodies had me cracking up in the theater. Most of the special effects are gorgeous and there's a lot of action in it too. I thought the story was kind of generic and not that interesting even though it did have some twists in it. The ending was a tad bit disappointing since it kinda left some questions unanswered and came out of the blue but overall the movie was good. I'd say it's a movie that is best seen in the cinema."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Super cool movie. I love the concept of Nazis from the dark side of the moon. The movie is not only absolutely funny but transports also a great portion of morale."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Iron sky may be misunderstood by some for its trashy dark humor and for its abundance of cultural references. To those who understand and appreciate this, the movie is a gift from heaven. Iron Sky is guaranteed to become a classic, so may as well just watch it now."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Iron sky has a great mix of comedy, movie references and criticism of modern culture. Comedy parts are very well structured and in just right places. Also visuals are handled well, knowing that this is not Hollywood production. I would definitely recommend it to all."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The concept and beautiful absurdity of the idea surpasses vastly the final realisation.Some moments of the film are brilliant, sublime and truly very funny, but then they are surrounded by others that just show glimpses of potential fun to be exploited buried deep in the dark side of the Moon.The cast, the narrative, the visuals, the direction and the dialogue are all an experiment on \"hit and miss\".In my opinion it is still a film to watch (if it does not pain your wallet to much), just be warned that you will find yourself at the end wishing it would have lived to its full promise of bizarre, demented fun."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "There are a lot of really funny moments in this film, and they're worth the price of admission. However, they don't quite overcome a slow pace and uneven tone (switching from whacky action/comedy to dark and grim). If anything, it's quite impressive for such a modest budget."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Fantastic Movie, I visualize like Watchmen and Sucker Punch, and is funny, Iron Sky is a great sci-fi, comedy, action, parody movie, I love Iron Sky. Great movie."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "< See those critic reviews on the left? Those are there and give this movie 50 out of 100 because Iron Sky makes a laugh of the culture they represent. It's a witty and funny movie that derides the pop culture and politics as a whole with a ton of well-chosen references, proving that you don't need an AAA budget to create a good movie with stunning visuals nor that you must have a Spielberg as the executive producer. It is not \"as funny or cruel as its killer premise\"? Oh come on! It's a wonderfully done B-class black comedy that even in the end mocks Hollywood productions! And it's great! Don't listen to \"critics\" whom the movie criticizes! I saw the \"killer premise\" and I expected a movie with a simple plot, full of bad acting, with lots of star battles and jokes about the nazi, all presented in a high quality way. Except for bad acting, which was correct and decent, all was there and I'm far from disappointed."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This movie is just awesome it has good jokes and good acting. Best movie made by Finland and one of my favorites. I would say it is mostly a sci-fi and comedy movie the action scenes were little slow but still good movie."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The film is brilliant in concept and has some absolutely killer sight gags, especially with respect to Nazi-genre tropes. (i.e. a Nazi spaceman riding a motorcyle with a side car on the moon). Unfortunately, they did not put nearly enough thought into the script. It could have been so much better. It's like they were having so much find with the IDEA of Nazis in space that when it came to writing a plot they were sitting around getting high and someone just said \"Oh, I don't know, let's have Sarah Palin be the President, that would be funny, LOL!\" And they just ran with that - which is so lame in comparison to the Space Nazi parts of the film that it just drags the whole thing down. And then the old trope about turning a black man white. Just Sad. Waste of a fantastic concept, really. On the plus side, they make have invented Nazi-Steam-Punk. It really does have a great aesthetic cross between the stylistic aspects of Nazi films and goth-indistrial-steam-punk aesthetics. Everything is gears and pulleys and chains and heavy machinery, in shades of grey and black instead of brass. The men dress in shiny leather black trench coats and the women wear trim form fitting grey business suits. Or occasionally corsets. With nazi armbands."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Iron Sky is definitely a fun movie . With the mixer of si-fi and comedy its just never boring . Good story , it was so different and script was kinda funny too. Most of the films like this just dont work out but it really did. The cast was amazing and funny on their own way. and the visual effect of the film was surprisingly amazing. I mean how did they do all those with a budget of \u00e2"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "this film was funny and exciting the exploitation and the way they did this film was absolutely amazing. this film had the best story line, the best chosen actors and a very well done back story of the Americas having a female president that had the might of an ant. this film will be going down in my books as one of the best films in sic fi and comedy. well done."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I really enjoyed this, but, it's not for everyone. If you can get behind something that's intentionally a bit cheesy, intentionally a bit 'b-movie' and you can suspend disbelief for the sake a bit of enjoyable nonsense then this may well work for you.If you're expecting a top of the line sci fi movie that takes things seriously and spends lot of time doing a good job of being serious then you'll be disappointed, I think."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Nazis living on the Moon and building their super space battleship to conquer the Earth! It is true, they live on the dark side of the Moon and they are totally disconnected from the life on the Earth, they still live in 50s. They don't even know what Nazis did to the world in the last century, they think that they are good and that their mission is to spread peace among us living on the Earth. Only F\u00c3\u00bchrer and some generals know their evil plans. As an advertisement for American president elections two astronauts land on the Moon and they see the dark side of it. On of them is black and that causes a lot of silly questions among Nazis. But rulers of the Earth (specially American president, who is a woman) aren't any better. There is also a space battle like in Star Wars. I must admit that this movie is really critical to present world order. A lot of comical situations happen and you are able to learn some basics of Deutsche Sprache."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Made for 7,5 m\u00e2"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This movie was a very positive surprise for me.When I bought the ticket, I didn't know this movie was a comedy. I expected a really idiotic no-brainer similar to Asylum movies (like classical Titanic 2, Sharktopus or Megapython vs Gathoroid) that's stupidity I can laugh at. The moment I realised it's a comedy though, a voice in my head said: \"Oh f***. It's going to be next Epic movie or Disaster movie\". I don't think I've ever been so happy about being wrong.Iron Sky, while not a masterpiece is definitely a /likable movie/. There is some clever humor (I wasn't expecting that), a lot of political satire and some references to other films and internet culture. I cannot say much without spoiling the movie, so I'll just recommend it to everyone who likes some simple silly humor, and ridiculous plot."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "This is a very well produced, atrocious \"B\" movie.  This film is not good but that is where it shines, it is a \"B\" movie for the sake of being a \"B\" movie. It never tries to take itself seriously in any way and only manages to pull off it's attempt at scripted humor occasionally.  If you find yourself laughing it is usually \"at\" the movie and certainly not \"with\" it.  A perfect candidate for a \"bad movie night\".  I've seen worse, but not by much. Ed Wood would be proud."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Iron Sky has one of the great all-time exploitation movie premises. There's no point beating about the bush, it's about space Nazis. Apparently, after they lost WWII, the Reich retreated to the moon, but feel the time is right for world domination 67 years later. For a film of its type, it works more often than not, though the setup is clunky even by B-movie standards, and the film as a whole is a bit too drawn out. There are a few satisfyingly surreal and tongue-in-cheek gags, the best of which mocks contemporary world politics (with a particularly cruel, but hilarious Sarah Palin caricature performed pitch-perfectly by Stephanie Paul) and another which involves two Nazi soldiers passionately disagreeing with the appeal of 21st century pornography. Despite these memorable moments and sporting some rather impressive visual effects for an independent Finnish film, Iron Sky often, sometimes fatefully, plays it far too straight-faced. The film's marketing campaign got it right by really embracing how ridiculous it is, and the film would probably have benefited from being similar in tone to the Tarantino/Rodriguez Grindhouse project from a few years ago - a parody, but a knowing, high-quality homage rather than an outright spoof that has the potential to quickly run out of steam. At the end of the day, though there's a lot to like in Iron Sky, and though you will probably laugh at some point, it needs to be far funnier to make the whole concept work."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "The film was enjoyable to watch but it just wasn't that good. The idea of it seemed amazing a first and the initial trailer presented a sinister invasion from the nazi's where earth struggles to survive. but the film was different. it turned out to be more like a slap-stick/comedy/disaster/crime movie in which it failed in each category. The acting was mostly appalling, although Julia Dietze fulfilled her role perfectly. not living up to it's premise Iron Sky was a disappointment. there were some remotely humorous moments and the CGI was \"top notch\". The big war ship which was revealed near the end after a large build-up got destroyed far too early. it was like the scene in transformers 2 where the big robot thing climbs the pyramid then gets blown up in a few seconds. we expect it to wreak havoc for at least half an hour but no, it travelled ten feet after blasting a hole in the moon...then it crashed! i feel like in the film, the \"earthlings\" won a bit too easily; all the nazi's did was blow up a few buildings in new york, but the \"earthlings\" practically destroyed everything including the moon base itself. Overall it was cheesy and predictable and shallow and a bit hard to keep up with whats going on at some points. but the CGI was fantastic, and Julia Dietze was well hot.\r Worth a watch, but nothing to rave about"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "This film had such promise but to be honest I found it very dumb and really not very funny. Basically gave up watching three quarters of the way through. I never really felt as though the creators knew what kind of movie they wanted to make. Best part was the nazi babe. Not much else to see."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "A textbook example of how an interesting general concept can be turned into a terrible movie. This is so sad! What one could have done with a budget of 7.5 million and Nazi UFOs...

I was killing for some good Nazi jokes - none here I'm afraid. Seems they spent all their time and money trying to make the film look expensive, instead of making it funny. The only time our packed audience really laughed was at a topical joke that had nothing to do with the film's story. The only thing you really need to know about this movie, is that for a film about NAZIS FROM SPACE, it ends on a serious note. Argghhhh!"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "The comedy is predictable, the characters shallow and boring. There are a lot of enjoyable moments, but most attempts at comedy fail.

Some episods (about 90% of movie) is so absurd, so its even hard to watch. White afroamerican, what? You can see bad painted bleach on his face. Main actors, especially Helper of President, President herself and that Colonel or Vice-Furer-somewhat guy have faces like it was smashed by iron and want more. Fight of presidents at the end of movie? I wished someone to kill me. That episode of afroamerican and nazi girl almost flying away in open space? Lolz\rBut that Renata girl is quite cute, I also liked the moment when they meet with President and Renata explains their politics.\rI wont reccomend anyone to watch this, and hardly will watch it myself, but for sore reason I will keep it in my library.\rp.s.

The characters were probably one of the biggest highlights aside from the great premise. Although i suppose almost every aspect of the movie succeeds in my opinion.\rthe characters; the characters were  all awesome especially the \"black guy\". his scenes and the things that he goes through were probably the best parts of the movies. My favorite quote of the movie was \"im the moon spook you turned into a snowflake\". Good stuff. Also the female nazi was awesome in how naive she was to how the world really worked and she was also incredibly sexy. The female president was also a great character always working out and being an overly stereotypical female politician. She acted very well.\rThe plot; its overlly obsurd and thats a definite plus for me that someone takes a chance on such a bizarre title. And the movie delivers on the idea of nazis from space. We have a cool refreshing look at nazis and then there is the space element that makes this movie fall into the sci-fi category. You also have the black guy thrown into the nazi mix and i feel they pulled off this great premise very well.\rThe movie has it all, beautifull women(no nudity), action, sci-fi, comedy, and of course...nazis. I'd highly recommend it as being one of the most origonal movies i have seen in a while."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Not as good as it could have been.

There are like a dozen story-threads that aren't resolved, sure, you have a few jokes here and there that actually made me laugh, but the whole ordeal in general just made me cringe more than anything. And I really can't say more about it, the CGI is mostly sub-par (the first scene looks horrendous on its own), the characters are flat caricatures, and the whole movie isn't even funny on an ironic level. It's not boring, there's just so much potential that's been wasted here."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "What did I just see? This is so bad on every level.
