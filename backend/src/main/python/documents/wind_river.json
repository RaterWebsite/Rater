      "text": "I found Wind River well done thriller with some nice acting, visuals and emotional moments. It has a slow start followed by an engaging middle part but it definitely drops the ball at the end. I liked Elizabeth Olsen as the out of her depth FBI officer who does her best. Jeremy Renner is also good but seems to lack screen presence. The rest of the cast give a good performance. Overall a decent movie with a good cast but marred by a poor ending and script that doesn't always work well.I will only make a few observations about the weak parts of the movie.Jeremy Renner?Given that the movie is set in an Indian Reservation I found it curious that this role was not given to a native or that there is hardly anything done with the fact that Renner is a white man living among Indians. Specifically because an important theme throughout the movie is that life in an Indian reservation is hard and the natives are treated as second rank citizens. It is one time alluded to that Renner isn't one of them, but most of the movie sees him treated as one of them. In addition Renner is actually a hunter of dangerous wildlife. It almost feels like this should have been played by native but that the studio probably didn't have the balls to cast one as the lead.Renner's additional problem is that he seems to have a weak screen presence in this movie and he is at his best alone. Perhaps this is actually well played.  The problems it that the moment someone else steps into the frame the camera seems to turn away from him, like happens with Graham Greene(the chief of police), Olsen and even his ex wife played by Julia Jones. I am still not certain if that is well done or just his issue.Those infernal pumas.An important part in the movies is played by the elusive pumas. It is searching for them that makes Renner find the first body and lateron he finds via them an important clue about the murder. The confrontation between Renner and the pumas seems inevitable, and I was expecting that this would lead to some kind of payoff near the end. However, nothing is done. In fact it isn't even shown that he kills these predators in the end after he has found them, which feels like someone didn't had the nerve to have them killed and not even have it suggested by having some shots fired?Dropping the ball...This movie is a thriller set in a cold landscape giving you this eerie forlorn feel sometimes changed into beautiful visuals. This contradiction of the deadly blizzards and stunning beautiful landscapes is an important aspect of the movie. It is mirrored in the movie for the people: Renner's happy family before his daughter was killed and his breakup with his wife after. Much of this is alluded to(and might have been even more profound with a better director and script)...then the end happens. The end is a sudden change of pace. Perhaps because this contrasts with the first three quarters of the movie just like a blizzard follows a beautiful wintry landscape. However it feels like they suddenly decided to take a sharp turn and step into another genre. I leave it at this, as to not spoil your fun, but I felt that the ending was not well executed, especially because they just show you what happened scene by scene during the murder. It spoils the thriller/mystery aspect. Like really, was that needed? Like really, can't you solve a case without knowing that you got it right?"

      "text": "This movie really surprised me. I didn't even hear about it in theaters, and when my wife and I came across it browsing for movies to rent at home we passed on it several times. The trailer really made it seem slow, boring, and not really any different from any movie like this that I've already seen. I couldn't have been more wrong. This is one of those movies that punches you in the gut and never lets you back up even after it's over. It's so powerful that I watched it with my best friend and we normally talk through a whole movie while we are at home but we sat in silence, completely gripped by this movie. Jeremy Renner is fantastic, and this movie proved to me that Elizabeth Olsen is a powerhouse actress that is not fairly represented by her role as Scarlet Witch in the MCU. Instantly one of my favorites that I will come back to time and time again."

The third person always kept me on the edge. Also the cold and raw vibe was present the whole movie. Actors doing their really great job here, they just reflected perfectly on their character's pain and their emotional state, which also the audience can feel here. I certainty had a few moments of dropping tears through my watch through. The Writing was really simple and reflected on the simpleness of the natives, and the rest of the people forced to live those areas. And in my opinion the action had it's perfect flow, and had no pacing issues. Overall it's a very good movie which should be more appreciated."

      "text": "BREAKDOWNWriting (Taylor Sheridan): The story of 'Wind River' is beautiful and structured flawlessly. I even enjoyed the flashback they threw in to give us the backstory on the crime. It was also a nice little surprise visit from Jon Bernthal. The characters were very well-written and each one was emotionally complex. In addition, that ending was incredibly satisfying. 8/10Performances: The acting is all wonderful, whether it be from the central cast or the supporting. It was beautiful watching the hospital scene and seeing Elizabeth Olsen break down, very similar to the medic scene from Captain Philips. I only saw one problem with the acting and it came from an extra. When Natalie's dead body is lying on the examination table, the actress playing the dead body is seen breathing through the diaphragm. It's small but noticeable. 8/10Cinematography (Ben Richardson): The cinematography is outstanding in this film and goes the extra mile to show off the beautiful scenery of the snow-covered mountains. Absolutely flawless on the part of Richardson. 10/10Editing (Gary Roach): I was surprised to see how great the editing was, especially during some parts where I can imagine it was challenging. The moment of the pepper spray raid was well-edited, as well as the flashback. 10/10Visual Effects: The VFX were well-done and seamless from the practical effects. From the blood running down characters' faces to the look of frostbite to the dead animals. It all looked stunning and is exactly how filmmakers should apply VFX. 10/10Enjoyment: 'Wind River' is a very exciting film that constantly has the audience's attention and curiosity. It even goes the extra mile to make sure it satisfies the viewer with an incredible ending and a connection to the real world we live in. 8/10Musical Score (Nick Cave/Warren Ellis): Cave and Ellis bring it again with a beautiful score after their excellent job on 'Hell or High Water'. The soundtrack is very similar to that soundtrack but supplies some different tracks that help convey the freezing cold of this setting. 9/10Sound Mixing: The sound mixing is very well-done in this flick as we're given a lot of ambiance through the sound alone. Even the gunshots are well done, minus the fact that some of the sound effects they used for the gunshots were ones used in many movies before. However, that was not distracting enough to be a problem. 9/10Production Design (Neil Spisak): The scenes were well-designed from the cabins and trailers to the yards they reside in. Even the natural settings are beautifully crafted. 10/10Overall: 'Wind River' is another excellent film by Taylor Sheridan after my personal favorite of his 'Hell or High Water.' The film is mysterious and jaw-dropping while also opening our eyes to travesties done toward Native American people. 9/10"

I sometimes find it hard to watch him as an actor, but he blew me away in this role. Elizabeth Olsen also did a fantastic turn as the young FBI agent trying to do the right thing. It's a very thought-provoking thriller and manages to tell the story clearly without complicated, long-winding plot points. The lives of the characters in the story and how they react to what's happening in their town are very well developed, and it easily encourages you to become invested them.  I hugely enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend it."

I wasn't quite sure whether Elizabeth Olsen was quite right for her role but warmed up to her a bit more as it played out.  Jeremy Renner is perfect-the role is made for him.  Beautiful cinematography & direction.  Any minor issues I had with the film are just too minor to mention.  Overall a must-see, even though the trailer may not motivate, force yourself.

He tracks animals that kill the residents livestock but on a hunt, he comes across a young woman frozen in the snow. She turns out to have been his daughter's best friend. The female FBI agent lacks experience and enlists Renner's help. Good plot, nice paced film. Well directed and acted. Has some graphically violent scenes .

The movie is notable for its sweeping aerial scenes of the beautiful Wyoming winter landscape, emotional scenes, one particularly wrenching, involving Olsen\u2019s character, Renner\u2019s character\u2019s grit and Graham Green\u2019s assured supporting performance as Tribal Police Chief Ben.

It has a lot of suspense, intrigue and an excellent turn at the end. Renner is impressive as this character acts to which one easily comes to empathize, Olsen seemed very good to me, but totally eclipsed by his partner. Very good direction, photography and a music that makes you skin on edge. The bad thing is that at times I was a bit dense and Sheridan script has a couple of clicks that we saw in Sicario and Hell or High Water (previous work of this writer)."

With the excellent Native American supporting actors employed here, it feels like the cinematic version of a Longmire episode, which is a huge compliment in my book. Kudos, finally, to Elizabeth Olson for her spare performance, which could have been played up and caricatured. She's subtly terrific in her role."

(Anyone else think he's underappreciated, for some reason?) The cinematography is captivating, the vast snowy vistas contrast with people's grim lives on and off the reservation. You know there's a deeper tragedy in Cory's life beyond just being a divorced dad with a lonely job, but you get to those deeper layers slowly. Supporting cast is excellent. I like Elizabeth Olsen -- she says a lot just with her eyes -- but can't imagine any FBI office sending this young woman into this situation, and feel an actress with more grit would have been better in that part. Overall, though, a stunning film that stays with you."

      "text": "This final piece to Taylor Sheridan's \"modern western\" trilogy is as gloomy, as gut-wrenching, and as effective as any other film in the batch. But, what sets \"Wind River\" apart from both \"Sicario\" and \"Hell Or High Water\" - aside from the fact that this one features Sheridan himself in the director's chair - is just how staggering the message is this time around. True, the statements on the drug war and the housing/financial crisis made for interesting thematic fodder, but I think \"Wind River\" speaks to a topic that has unfortunately gone far less discussed: life on the Native American reservation. Couple these hauntingly illustrated truths with some brilliant performance work from both Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen, and you end up with one of the year's most underrated films."

Well done you, at least you tried.An FBI agent teams up with a local hunter to investigate a murder on a Native American reservation. With Taylor Sheridan, the writer of Sicario and Hell or High Water you\u2019re left with the same type of highly atmospheric slow builder. Incredibly tense and interspersed with scenes of shocking violence. You\u2019ll be on the edge of your seat. A brilliantly told story, it\u2019s dark, depressing and is likely to get a reaction from most people. If you like Fargo or Nocturnal Animals then this is right up your street. Highly recommended."

      "text": "Taylor Sheridan is the mastermind writer behind Denis Villeneuve\u2019s \u201cSicario\u201d (2015) and David Mackenzie\u2019s \u201cHell or High Water\u201d (2016), in which he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Although no continuity, \u201cWind River\u201d acts as the final chapter in Sheridan\u2019s neo-western frontier trilogy, once again romanticising his passion for western tropes and the gun slinging violence of that era. Western feel aside, Texas-born Sheridan\u2019s previous scripts were topical that provoked thought, discussion and insight into various issues. Wind River is no different. \u201cSicario\u201d tackled the US war on Mexican drug cartels, trafficking and ambiguity of law enforcement methods and jurisdiction, whilst \u201cHell or High Water\u201d highlighted the economic plight of West Texas, the US housing crisis and predatory practices of financial institutions. Wind River focuses on American social issues such as the marginalisation of Native Americans, impoverishment, substance abuse and cultural ignorance.This crime thriller mystery opens with a barefoot teenage girl sprinting desperately across a moon soaked snow covered open plain, until she collapses with exhaustion, ultimately crawling to her death. The next day she is discovered by Cory Lambert, a Wyoming tracker played by Jeremy Renner, who immediately recognises her as a friend of his teenage daughter. With the death of the Native American girl occurring on the Wind River Native American Reservation, tribal police become involved, headed by its straight faced chief played by Graham Greene. The death also captures the attention of the FBI and they send their \u201cclosest\u201d agent from Las Vegas to help investigate. Elizabeth Olsen joins Renner, her Avengers co-star, playing inexperienced FBI agent Jane Banner. Her girl like demeanor, lack of preparation for the harsh climate and cultural ignorance all brilliantly add to her fish out of water character and the reservations isolation from the outside world. Her character traits remind me of Jodie Foster\u2019s Clarice Starling from The Silence of the Lambs.Banner and Lambert combine to try and solve the mysterious circumstances of Natalie\u2019s death with Lambert motivated by a past family tragedy. The relationship between Banner and Lambert is handled impressively as they both leverage each other\u2019s skill set to move forward with the investigation. Despite her inexperience, Banner is still presented as a strong, equipped female lead, much like Sheridan wrote for Emily Blunt\u2019s character in Sicario. Sheridan also avoids the temptation of making the two love interests, which would have been clich\u00e9d and made zero sense in the context of the story and each characters arc, instead establishing more of a mutual respect mentor relationship. Story wise, the rest of the film plays out as your typical police investigation slow burn until a violently intense climax lifted straight from the page of a Tarantino movie. It\u2019s a climax that pays off, especially with an important scene that swerves the story from its seemingly conventional delivery that caught me off guard and was quite impressive and cleverly implemented.This is easily one of Jeremy Renner\u2019s best performances.  It was a refreshing change that steered away from the emotionless brooding failure of Aaron Cross or light-hearted comic relief of a charter from the MCU. Lambert has personal demons that motivate him to help assist the investigation and although stoic for most parts, he has moments that scratch the surface of the heartbreak bubbling underneath. Renner\u2019s best scenes come with Natalie\u2019s grieving father Martin, played by the fantastic Gil Birmingham, also from Hell or High Water,  who acts as a link for the socio-economic problems faced on the reservation. The cinematography captures the landscape perfectly, with some great high shots that emphasize the harsh environment during snow storms and picturesque mountains during the day.Although she was flawless and matched Renner in performance and presence, Elizabeth Olsen\u2019s character had very little back story or motivation other than being an FBI agent stationed in Las Vegas. Sheridan\u2019s character driven scripts usually leave no stone un-turned and whilst it didn\u2019t deter from the movie, it may have been a missed opportunity to strengthen FBI agent Banner\u2019s impact.The symbolism portrayed in the opening scene with Jeremy Renner acting as protector by sniping off a pack of wolves preying on a pack of weak defenceless goats sets the tone for the films narrative. Survival and protection from predators. Sheridan\u2019s directorial debut and third original screenplay Wind River is equal parts impressive and hauntingly dark. Suffering from comic book hero fatigue? With some surprising cameos, an amazing cast and a character driven script, Wind River is a must for fans of original screenplays and contemporary crime thrillers with a western edge."

There\u2019s a bunch of smaller characters around but it\u2019s very much about them two, or rather the tracker guy alone.If you have seen (among others) \u201eWinter\u2019s Bone\u201c, \u201eA Single Shot\u201c, \u201eJustified\u201c or any other story of this type, you can already guess what you\u2019re in for.I would compare \u201eWind River\u201c mostly to 2013\u2019s \u201eA Single Shot\u201c starring Sam Rockwell, this being mostly about one unlikely male hero who has to take matters into his own hands, with a little exciting violence in the end. And both are also about mental and physical isolation, and solving stuff alone.Having written that, an early Nolan work \u201eInsomnia\u201c also sprung to mind for comparision, which was my favorite Nolan until the mighty \u201eDunkirk\u201c arrived.The movie\u2019s mostly about building \u2013 characters, their state of mind, sense of place, mood, suspense.The aim is not to dispense fast pleasures or easily digestible entertainment, and there\u2019s no need for that, because once you are able to invest yourself in the story, you\u2019ll probably agree that screenwriter and debuting director Taylor Sheridan is very able to pull it all off.Everybody's not gonna be happy about how they have built up the explosive finale, but I liked it. No problems with that kind of approach, at least in this case.Acting is very good all around, with delicate, nuanceful, and well measured performances from everybody from the central hero to the smallest characters on-screen.\u201eWind River\u201c is a cool directorial debut from Taylor Sheridan, who has previously acted in TV but also written screenplays for \u201eSicario\u201c and \u201eHell or High Water\u201c, both unfortunately unwatched by me (and most others) so far. But both have received encouraging word of mouth, and \u201eWind River\u201c makes me want to see these even more.It\u2019s a good TV series quality drama, which is highest honor an American movie can receive in 2017. Bleak and depressing but ultimately satisfying stuff."

He used everything in his wheelhouse, including the environment, to create a very dark  and very sinister tone. The realism of this movie is scary and very gripping throughout. It didn't feel like a movie, it felt small and real. I felt like I was going along with these characters attempting to solve this horrific murder along side them.2. Acting- The acting in this movie was something that was truly amazing. Jeremy Renner gave hands down his best performance. Renner truly carried this movie with what I believe to be a truly oscar worthy role. Elizabeth Olson also had the role of her carrier in Wind River. I didn't see either of these characters as \"actors\" I saw them as the characters they were portraying and I felt like they had lives outside of the movie we were watching. The back story to Cory Lambert was so heartfelt and real I felt like I lived it with him. 3. Script- This movie had some of the best conversational scene I have seen in a long time. The dialogue in this movie was masterfully crafted. Nothing felt out of place and all of the dialogue felt like natural everyday conversation. The scene in which Cory tells Jane about his tragic past was one of the most captivating scenes I have scene in a while. Every part of this script just felt well crafted and put together.4. Entertaining- Wind River had a lot of entertainment value to it. It was one of the best murder mysteries I have seen. After Sheridan's Hell or High Water, I was expectant of a pretty good crime thriller. Wind River to me, was more entertaining. Every scene had me sitting closer to the screen and I was sitting on the edge of my seat by the end of it. It also had to really surprising and exciting action scenes.5. Ending- Taylor Sheridan did an amazing job of making this movie have one of the best endings I have seen in a long time. It was satisfying on a really big level. It didn't end in a conventional way, but the ending was cathartic in a lot of ways. The climax of this movie was almost sickening and was very hard to watch. Jeremy Renner really helped sell the ending of this movie in a big way.Overall, Wind River was one of the best movies I have seen this year. From the very beginning of this movie I knew it was going to be something extremely special. Wind River was an excellent movie and very entertaining. Jeremey Renner and Elizabeth Olson both gave the performances of their careers. I highly recommend seeing Wind River. I am going to give Wind River an A."

      "text": "Fantastic movie. Written and directed by the guy who wrote Hell or High Water, which is also a fantastic movie (as well as Sicario, which I am not as high on). Lots of layers, a fresh narrative structure, and loads of great acting. At the very least, it would be nice to see Gil Birmingham get an Oscar nod for supporting actor.This is a movie that trusts the intelligence of the viewer, which means we can take a few perfectly-chosen words and imply paragraphs of emotion and exposition. For example, on the destruction of Native American culture:-Jeremy Renner: \u201cWhat\u2019s with the paint?\u201d-Gil Birmingham: \u201cThis is my death face\u201d-JR: \u201cAnd how do you know what that is?\u201d-GB: \u201cI don\u2019t. I just made it up. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s anyone around to teach me.\u201dThat\u2019s it. No explanation, no further dialog, no righteous lectures. And with that, we know that a father can\u2019t properly mourn his daughter because even that piece of culture been taken from him, along with everything else.Jeremy Renner also excels in a role which seemed made for his toughness and deliberate pacing.  He might even have reached Gus McCrae-level frontier righteousness, which isn\u2019t an easy thing to do.Finally, the entire movie oozes respect for its subject and makes a compelling point without stooping to, as Mr. Birmingham has said in interviews, \"poverty porn.\"An all-around good film, and definitely in my top 5 for this year."

When you see someone on sites like this give a movie a zero, it is advised to look at their profile because you often find they love movies that are trashed by others and hate ones loved by the majority. It is insane that this movie could be given a 0 by anyone with real taste because it has all of the following: fantastic acting; cinematography; script; setting. Give this movie a try, you will be glad you did."

They could have asked someone from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to review it, but no they would rather be inaccurate. Renner would not be employed by the FWS because they don't kill predators, he would be employed by Wildlife Services, which is Dept. of Agriculture. Except for not seeing peoples breath on supposed cold days, a good movie."

      "text": "Wind River is a really intense crime/thriller film about the mysterious death of a young Native American woman. Corey (Jeremy Renner) and Jane (Elizabeth Olsen) are the main two characters we follow as they try to solve the case. Good insight is given into the characters so that we understand their motivations and why they want to solve the case. As the case continues to be solved the film gets more and more intense, leading up to some really graphic and shocking moments. The direction and performances are what make it all work, making every scene feel so real and grounded. The location the film takes place in is also worth mentioning, Wind River. It is both beautiful yet secluded from civilization, causing the characters to rely on the few people they have to survive."

      "text": "Taylor Sheridan has done it again. I saw Wind River at the Nantucket Film Festival in June and I thought it was excellent. And based on the response of the people around me in the packed theater, I wasn't the only one. The applause at the end was loud and long. (The movie ended up coming in second at the festival, right behind behind The Big Sick) I enjoyed it as much as, if not more than, Hell or High Water. And definitely more than Sicario.The scenery, the score, the dialogue and the acting were all on point. Some of Jeremy Renner's best work. He's been spending so much time playing spy and superhero lately that I think people tend to forget that he was nominated for The Hurt Locker and The Town. His performance here is even better. I will definitely see this again once it's in wide release in my area."

What a masterpiece, and btw who says there aren't any good movies this summer??  I liked how the movie spoon fed you little tidbits, and let the suspense build.  Jeremy Renner knocks it out of the park as Fish and Wildlife agent Cody Lambert.  He plays the agent with heartfelt emotions as you feel like he is on a mission to make amends for his own daughters untimely death.  Not only lots of action, suspense, and mystery, but it is packed with a lot of emotions.  Gives you the dark side of how our Native American's feel despair.  Also the FBI agent played by Elizabeth Olsen packs a lot of punch, as you get this impression like she is in over her head.  I have to say I went to this movie with expectations and it ended up being all met, as I had a feeling I could have been in for a let down with all the hype, as that has happened in the past.  Not in this case as this movie was a gem!  Hats off to all including the director Taylor Sheridan.  This is one I could go see again and still enjoy....huge thumbs up!!"

A true life horror, this not only touches on the crimes of our nations past affecting the future, but how nature can be so paradoxically brutal and beautiful at the same time. Every scene seemed authentic. A true drama/crime masterpiece. Oh and the location/cinematography is 10/10 easily."

The movie is not perfect though, especially when it comes to some of the longer expositional segments where characters have \"deep\" conversations that are supposed to be moving. Many of these feel like they don't hit their mark. Also there is one particular scene that is out of place. It is so nonsensical that it really deflated some of the tension of the movie. Overall though I'd still say this is a great film and worth watching."

      "text": "Few writers have been in a better position to express their voice so clearly than Taylor Sheridan. While just his second directorial effort, Sheridan's voice was brought to life in both Sicario and Hell or High Water to the point that it feels as though both were directed by him. However, in seeing Wind River, the first film he wrote and directed (his debut Vile was just directed by him), it is clear that he does benefit from working with better directors. While Sheridan capably directs the film's strong script, it remains true that in the hands of somebody better, Wind River could have been a classic. As it stands, it is instead a pretty good film with great ideas on its mind that it handles far too bluntly at times. A thrilling and sorrowful film about a murder on an Indian reservation, Wind River works, but not to the degree that it should have, leaving it as a good but disappointing work.In both Sicario and Hell or High Water, it became clear that Sheridan's thematic focus was upon the disenfranchised. In the former, he focused on those living under the thumb of the Cartel in both Mexico and across the border in America. In the latter, he focused upon those left behind in the dust by the financial collapse in the late 2000s. Now, in Wind River, he turns his focus on a group of people all Americans have contributed to the demise of: Native Americans. With a Native American girl, Natalie Hanson (Kelsey Chow), found dead on the reservation by wild life and game tracker Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner), the murder serves as merely a gateway into the life on the reservation. For FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen), this functions as if it were another world. Completely isolated and on their own without back-up, the tribal police run by Ben (Graham Greene), operates across a territory the size of Rhode Island with just six officers. With such little police presence, no opportunity for advancement via education or jobs, and readily available drugs and alcohol, the Wind River Indian Reservation is the quintessential depiction of life for Natives in America right now. With missing Native girls reaching astronomical figures, alcoholism running rampant, and drug use throughout, Wind River calls attention to the issues facing Natives in a searing, depressing, and realistic depiction. When handling these issues, Sheridan does so beautifully and skillfully, burying them within average conversations between Cory and men believed to be somewhat connected to the murder. In every home on the reservation, demons reside and it is best to pretend that they are not actually there.Found six miles from the nearest building, Sheridan's ability to use the death of Natalie as a metaphor and symbolism for the life of Natives is perhaps the film's most impressive aspect. Dying not from being raped or killed, but from having her lungs explode due to the cold weather, Sheridan subtly and smartly depicts how the land has even turned against Natives after all these years. Through the turmoil and strife thrust upon them by the whites and their arrival in the Americas, Natives could always count on the lands to sustain them in their time of need. However, with such little territory and animals such as the bison leaving Indian reservations, the staples of Native American life have left them in the lurch to the point that they have nothing to do and are without hope. What were once proud people have been left destitute through their interactions with whites and through the changing of times as crops die and animals leave. While whites led them to their grave with a gun to their head, the land is truly what nailed the final nail in the coffin of Natives in America with the land no longer being sustainable. However, while the situation is hopeless and destitute - just as the one faced by Natalie with her having to run six miles barefoot just to get where she was, which was nowhere - this race of people that have been in the Americas for thousands of years refuse to give up and will fight until their dying breathe.Sheridan, in the course of depicting how the land and circumstance is truly what is killing Native Americans, refuses to let whites off the hook. At the end of the day, the only reason Natives are in this situation to begin with because of whites. It is a central argument in the film that it is impossible to define. With the case of Natalie, she was clearly led to run in the snow by some malevolent force that is certainly guilty of homicide. However, the coroner cannot give the cause of death as homicide, as she died because of her lungs exploding. While it is true that it should be considered a homicide, that is not her cause of death. Though it may be true that the land turning against Natives has only worsened conditions on reservations, the only reason they are there to begin is whites, so how can the blame not be laid at the feet of whites across America who deny culpability in the matter?"
