  "description": "In 25 AD, Judah Ben-Hur, a Jew in ancient Judea, opposes the occupying Roman empire.  Falsely accused by a Roman childhood friend-turned-overlord of trying to kill the Roman governor, he is put into slavery and his mother and sister are taken away as prisoners.  Three years later and freed by a grateful Roman galley commander whom he has rescued from drowning, he becomes an expert charioteer for Rome, all the while plotting to return to Judea, find and rescue his family, and avenge himself on his former friend.  All the while, the form and work of Jesus move in the background of his life...",

Two groups of people giving this movie unjust hate. 1: people that went into this movie expecting the old movie. 2: People that are offended by Jesus/God. As a movie this one is pretty good; diffidently recommend it. I knocked two points off- one for the script (the depth could of been better) and one for all that they cut out (which is understandable seeing how this shaves a couple hours off the original). Not much else to say without spoiling. Just keep in mind people, in a world were it's accepted and even encouraged to kill kids (abortion), of course anything having to do with Jesus/God is going to get hated on. Don't take mine or any other person's word for it though, don't let the crowd dictate your views. Go see it for yourself and make your own judgement. It's on average only eight or so dollars to see a movie so go for it."

      "text": "Comparisons are odious as propagated by those who suffer from such comparisons, and whilst films like this attempt to remake classics from the golden years it is highly likely that the comparison drawn will be unfavourable to the pretender. The original Ben Hur was a record breaking, Oscar laden epic that employed the old school styles of acting, colour and cheesy special effects with such assured confidence that it almost defied criticism. This Ben Hur invites it, even if ultimately it is not as bad as cynical naysayers would have us believe. The original Judah, Charlton Heston, took the whole thing incredibly seriously turning in an Oscar winning performance which cemented his appeal in this type of sword and sandals pic. I\u2019m afraid that Jack Huston\u2019s lack of screen presence and charisma will not be doing the same for him. His Ben Hur, along with the rest of the cast actually, is one dimensional and colourless complimenting, in fact, the surprisingly drab production values. Director Timur Bekmambetov keeps the camera in close for many scenes which has the effect of dissipating any chance of an epic aura. To add to this the actors\u2019 line delivery is often flat and unconvincing. This adds immeasurably to the amateurish feel that the production can\u2019t seem to dispel for much of its running time. Still, two sequences work very well indeed aided no end by some wonderful camera shots, precise editing and impressive special visual effects. Firstly, the chariot race is good enough, and long enough, to stand favourable comparison to the earlier film and the galley slave scenes are also up to par in their excitement value. Not a complete disaster then, but it is another remake that is as misjudged and second rate as it is unnecessary."

      "text": "I really don't understand the preponderance of such negative reviews.  I am old enough to remember the 1959 Ben Hur and saw it in the theater when it first came out.  Although I agree it was a fabulous movie, I wonder what it would look like today if seen in the theater.  I am sure it would be great and probably better then this version despite being filmed under ancient photography conditions.  However, be that as it may, I enjoyed this movie very much.  Although nobody will probably ever out act Charlton Heston as Judah Ben Hur, I thought the acting was more than acceptable.  Of course, I don't think there is anybody who can surpass the acting of Morgan Freeman either.  I just love to see any movie he is in and they are all usually fairly good.  Although the story is certainly not plausible at all, neither were the other movies based on the book.  The book is a work of fiction after all.  If you never saw the 1959 movie with Heston as Judah Ben Hur, you have nothing to compare this one to, so just sit back and enjoy the movie."

      "text": "Part faith-based film and part swords-and-sandals epic, Ben-Hur succeeds better than the average Christian flick, a genre that has recently seen a resurgence of sorts in modern cinema. That's because it focuses on it's story first, and preaching second.Now one thing I can't do in this review is compare this remake to the original as I have not seen it. I can say though that it should be fairly obvious this movie isn't going to have the same impact as the original. At the very least though, it is entertaining.Spread across the tale of Ben-Hur's quest for vengeance are Christian themes and messages. You'll see Jesus and hear characters talk about how one should forgive their enemies instead of seeking revenge. These elements are thankfully not very heavy handed in their delivery, making them more bearable for non-believers. They do feel oddly included though. Like unnatural additions to the main plot that could have already been a story of forgiveness all on it's own.The main plot in the movie pretty solid and backed by equally solid performances. Just like the faith-based elements, it can feel uneven in execution. It does have the tendency to meander a bit from time to time, and when it finally does get to the fateful chariot race it's  full-throttle all the way to the conclusion. Speaking of that chariot race, it's quite thrilling to watch. There's one other moment of big-spectacle excitement to be found. The rest of the emphasis is on the story and characters, some of which go underdeveloped and just feel like bland faces meant to push the story forward.While lacking in truly epic moments, the ones it does have are still exciting to watch. Brought to life by solid special effects and a director who apparently knows how to put on some solid fireworks.While perhaps uneven in it's execution, Ben-Hur is a faith-based film that has the potential to entertain more than just hardcore believers. That's because it's part big action, special effects driven blockbuster with a strong emphasis on character drama. The themes of forgiveness are appreciated and it's a very relatable story in a sense in that appeals to emotions we've all felt. So it's definitely brought to life in all of the best ways, but at least it still manages to be fun.7.4/10"

This epic follows the conflict of 2 half-brothers in the time of Jesus: one is a Jewish price and the other a Roman. With the exception of the big boat battle, there's little dramatic tension.

Otherwise I'd miss many of the best movies I've seen.To be honest, after the crappy disasters of supposedly Christian movies meant to be directly based on the Bible that's Russell Crowe's weird \"Noah\" and Christian Bale's pathetic \"Exodus: Gods and Kings\", I almost gave up all hope of these un-Christian movies in Christian movie clothing, full of unashamed inauthenticity. So I decided to watch a movie that is NOT directly based on the Bible, Jack Huston's \"Ben Hur\", and it turned out to be more Christian than Noah or Exodus combined - all in a pretty epic movie!Given this is based on the book and being the 2nd movie made with the same name, the plot is no surprise. At high level, it's a story of 2 brothers who went their separate ways due to a misunderstanding and betrayal, where hate drove them closer and closer to killing each other, but in the end found that forgiveness was more powerful than vengeance. Now that would make a boring story if it wasn't for strong acting and scripting, and of course, the epic action scenes (the ship / galley and horse racing scenes in particular) which were done with absolute purpose, woven into the very story itself. Where's the Christian part of it? Well, Ben-Hur lives in the same period as Jesus Christ and so we find Ben-Hur and his family occasionally experiencing Jesus' wisdom and love. Of course, Jesus' narrative is only the backdrop and he only makes a couple of appearances. (this is not a Jesus film - for that, try Passion of the Christ!). Jack Huston and Toby Kebbell held strong chemistry as brothers in the movie - going from close brotherhood to distant enemies and reconciled as brothers again. Jack Huston proves to be a versatile actor, exuding joviality, confidence, hatred, joy, tenderness - expressing the right emotions at the right times. Morgan Freeman plays Ilderim, a good supporting role in helping Ben-Hur face his brother in the final showdown.This is one movie I would happily watch with the family. The values are wholesome, the action is epic, the movie is simply beautiful. Well worth the watch. One of the best movies I watched so far. And yes, of course it's better than the original - this is made in 2016 with better technology supporting the actors!"

So remake means we expect nothing less than a visual spectacular and this film had them at its best, including many more great features, but the real stars are missing. It was a let down without any notable performances. Besides, the idea of upgrading the story was good, though not everyone going to like that. Particularly the one who loved the old film or the versions.The length is justified. For the kind of story the film narrates, the pace was very good. So for me this is not a bad flick, but just some key features missing like I said the star value. For the first timers, like today's generation, this film might work, but for the others most probably not. And the end was disappointing, because it felt like watching a Disney film that made for children and families.I think the director of 'Wanted' did his job as it required. Definitely not an unnecessary remake, but should have been careful in the historic events. Overall, it fell short of depth. You won't feel emotions and/or the character's struggle. In the end it became just an entertainment product and if you expect beyond that, you are only responsible for that. So good luck with the watch if you are yet to give it a try.5/10"

It's really not that bad, but it's not the epic Charlton Heston movie we all love.\r I was disappointed that the production values weren't as high as you'd expect for a major motion picture release, but in general, this new take on a classic tale (yes I've read the book) stood on its two feet story wise.  The relationship between Judah and Masala was much more fleshed out, and the resolution of the rivalry between them was more satisfying for me in this movie, than it was in the 1959 epic.\r Standouts for me were the scenes of the naval battle and the chariot race.  Very gritty and realistic.  While the CGI could have been better, I think those scenes brought home just how brutal these events were.\r I enjoyed the movie, but to do so I had to ignore the sub par production values.  Had they spent more money on the production, my rating would have gone up to an 8.  I think they must have spent most of their budget on getting Morgan Freeman on board."

But the film maintains its balance and just gets better and better all the way till the end. The race scene towards the end was very intense and well-crafted. The acting in this movie was great and Morgan Freeman just made me laugh as a character in this film. The movie had a perfect runtime and I loved the connection to Jesus in this film. I think this is a great Bible movie to watch and I certainly was entertained. I was really surprised with this film and there was even a clapping ovation at the end. For some reason, my theater was nearly full, while Suicide Squad had only 10 people??? (98/100)"

      "text": "Lot better than expected, and the movie was competent. The acting for the most part was really good especially Jack Hudson. The movie doesn't really do anything the 1959 one didn't do. It felt like it was missing something though. The action scenes where pretty good especially the Ship fight and of course the Chariot scene. Atleast this one didn't end up being another horrible Hollywood remake even though it never should of been made, but it's nothing to ride home about."

      "text": "A different take on the classic movie.  While most of the elements stay the same, they are taken differently in light of Judah Ben-Hur's hearing the teachings of Jesus.  As a movie, not in the league of the classic, but okay.  I gave it points for the new story angle."

      "text": "Roman empire drama. The problem with remakes of historical titles for me is that modernisation of attitudes and dialogue makes it harder to accept the different values of a period setting. The lighting, sets and scale all set up the right atmosphere, and things improve when Morgan Freeman appears, but I did not find changes made to the plot added credibility. I was left disappointed, just watching another movie rather than becoming involved in a timeless story."

I can't express how bad the original one was but this rebuilding is a masterpiece, requires all unhealthy things that characterized the first movie and completely reworks it rendering it feel fresh, dated and beautiful at the same time, and the things that were good are brought to new rayon, the actors are definetely well chosen. This film is the definition of perfection. Watch and download this film here watch this movie."

Que ce soit en 4 heures ou en moins de 2, c'est trop niais, trop d\u00e9bile, trop gnagnan et trop con, alors arr\u00eate ton char parce que tu nous les casses s\u00e9v\u00e8rement ! j'ignore comment ils ont fait mais ce reboot reste en effet presque aussi chiant que la chienlit de 1959 qui n'en finissait plus... Les acteurs y sont en tout cas encore plus nazes que jadis... Evidemment les effets num\u00e9riques et les d\u00e9cors sont bien mieux faits et la mise en sc\u00e8ne n'est pas aussi craignos qu'on aurait pu le craindre. Mais \u00e7a craint bien quand m\u00eame, tout \u00e7a."
