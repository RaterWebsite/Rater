      "text": "Superman Returns is a sad case study. It was a unique reboot that recaptured the charm of the classic movies while moving forward into new territory. Routh as Clark Kent channeled Reeves brilliantly. It might have reignited the franchise if it had contained a few more epic action scenes for the audience that found it boring. As a coming of age tale, a man becoming a father, it delivered...but it lacked the bombastic action that superhero movies usually feature and there was rarely a sense of threat. I really enjoyed it for what it was but, after lots of discussions, can understand why many of the people who saw it were disappointed. It's a shame, if only Lex had recruited an actual supervillian Routh might still be Superman instead of the Atom."

      "text": "Singer was meant to finish directing the X-Men trilogy, and this proves it. The look of Superman Returns, while beautiful and streamlined, doesn't feel the way a Superman epic should. The lighting was never right and so everything looked dull and grey. The characters had little or no depth, with Superman showing no sign of anything resembling a personality and Lex Luthor's trademark cunning and meticulous scheming replaced with an over-the-top plan that carried no degree of subtlety or credibility. Overall, it was a good film, but not a great one. We could've had a great superhero film and it would've been X3. Instead we get two mediocre films marred forever by missed opportunities."

Superman Returns is the greatest superhero movie ever thanks to Bryan Singer(director of the two first X-men films) and I realized that this is an alternate sequel to both Superman l and ll ignoring lll and  lV so that's peculiar, Brandon Routh is a perfect guy for the role, and Lex Luthor is back once again played by Kevin Spacey, this character is more sadistic and cruel than Gene Hackman's character."

This movie has so many scenes that I just want to watch again and again, my favorite being the destruction of Lex's model of Metropolis. The scene just feels... real. Much of this movie is very simple, but real and unforgettable somehow. I can't really explain why Superman Returns is so great. Just watch it, and then you might understand what I'm trying to say."

The script was awful, the acting wooden, except for Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, and the directing even worse. The cast was fine but now that they are back they need something to work with. To be perfectly honest I too adore Superman but this was a very slow moving innate effort by the producers. Call a spade a spade."

Superman Returns seemed to have everything...great production values, great casting (Brandon Routh and Kevin Spacey) and a passionate film maker in the form of Mr Singer himself. But by making this a 'sequel' of some sort to Dick Donner's SUPERMAN, Singer pinned himself into a corner.  Face it, despite how brilliant Spacey is, Richard Donner's portrayal of Lex Luthor was crap. And for crying out loud, as much as I like Kate Bosworth, she is the worst Lois Lane in cinematic history. Superman Returns, beside  a really great set piece in the middle of the film, felt slow and 'too serious' for its own good. The critics may like it, but the audience didn't."

The movie completely lacks originality and I found myself on more than one occaision laughing with such gusto at the corny dialogue and leaps in logic, that I nearly had to leave the theatre. I cannot believe that any studio would have spent 200M on a franchise movie with a script this poorly written, and overacting that would embarass a Soap Opera cast, (Kevin Spacey's Lex Luthor excluded). With Spiderman, Batman Returns, and X-men having raised the bar for super hero movies, I expected so much more. Instead I was treated to a movie that ripped of the original throughout, stole from several other action flicks for it's story line, and did nothing to develop the characters at all. This is movie making at it's worst."

Directed by Bryan Singer the movie is certainly faithful to the originals and for the most part Brendon Routh is able to recapture the charm that made Christopher Reeve so popular in the role even if there never quite seems to be the same level of chemistry with Kate Bosworth\u2019s Lois Lane.\r The movies plot is perfectly passable, largely thanks to an excellent performance from Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, despite the fact that we never really learn anything more about the man of steel as the film progresses. Even if Superman has never been as interesting a superhero as Batman for example a little more insight into what had happened over the last five years would have still been nice.\r Overall, while it can perhaps be a little slow in places, thanks to some well shot action scenes and good performances Superman Returns is a worthy addition to the franchise."

      "text": "Overall, Superman Returns is the sort of force that's irrational, yet is ironically able to gain value by being aware of itself. What's meant by this is that the irrationality in question is perhaps that it's acceptable to oppose self-awareness without reason, and that the source of this dynamic isn't meant to be understood.Possessing self-awareness is a type of division, ergo a type of conflict. So from this definition, what can be projected onto Superman Returns is the formula that the source of being self-aware is the irrational, but, because that source was always inevitable that means that it's okay for an outcome of purity to derive from the act of self-awareness. Of course, the next problem that leads from this is that if Superman Returns is a process of getting to purity, is that meant to suggest that the movie itself is an evil product?Even if Superman Returns isn't evil per se, on the basis that evil is true, that still leaves the worrying and disturbing idea that Superman Returns is partly evil incarnate. Which makes sense, given that the story does feel very eerie, and very poignant and about impending doom. But then again, if the story is about impending doom, that provokes the great idea in which Superman Returns can be understood as a perfect encapsulation of a trade of identities: the story is about impending doom, and therefore the external product possessing the story being the process to purity is a very neat and very impressive reality. The probability, is that Superman Returns is indeed what's just been described. It doesn't seem far-fetched or out of place to perceive Superman Returns this way, but, there is then a new issue that arises: if this identity of purity for evil is real, is it worthwhile to point out that it's possible that this nature is a justification for the movie? If the justification is real, perhaps it's just a consequence of the story that the complexity isn't able to deal with the justification. After all, the purity that's ostensibly linked to the product isn't an actual part of the experience, not even when Kal-El visits Jason at the movie's very end, and so it seems fair game to think of Superman Returns as a type of failure. Failure, in this sense, isn't negligible but it also isn't important. The fact is that Superman Returns is a tremendous emotional experience, and frankly represents a much better type of art and philosophy of film-making than most other superhero and fantasy movies do. In the world of Superman Returns, the mundane and the common are the special and the supernatural. The typical human experience is the value of the story, the clear pattern of the story being the link between complexity and uniformity.In Superman Returns, spectacle derives from uniformity, but link between spectacle and uniformity is the theme of the movie rather than just some accidental byproduct. The supernatural nature of uniformity being possible is the movie's spiritual essence, and this is the sort of story depth that far outshines many other sci-fi classics. It's a crime that Superman Returns never got a sequel, but at the same time it isn't any wonder from an artistic perspective, similar to Batman & Robin.At the end of Batman & Robin, Barbara Wilson joins Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson to become a trio of superheroes; because of this intellectual development, it isn't a surprise that Batman & Robin never got a sequel, because the conceptual specialness of Batman, Robin and Batgirl was too precious to actually manifest. Superman Return was the exact same reality, ending on such a conceptually exciting and emotionally uplifting note that the prospect of any sequel to Superman Returns would've been daunting to say the least. Superman Returns has its flaws, but the real heart of its brilliance is that those flaws are in fact part of the very things that make Superman Returns an infinite case of magnificence"

That said, to be a drama is not enough. It must be a competent drama. I could go on about how Lex Luthor's plan makes no sense, or about the odd decision to give Superman a child, but I like to think that picking at individual aspects isn't as important as the overall tone. Plenty of superhero movies have gotten away with questionable fine details because they had the right tone and pacing hold interest and entertain (X-Men and Spider-Man immediately come to mind).
