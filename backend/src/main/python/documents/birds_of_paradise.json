      "text": "Birds of Paradise clearly tries to show that it's a nuanced, fine and elegant story about betrayal, pressure, and boicot, in race for a position to be the best.And all that's fine, if only this pretentious film really had that elegance, nuance and finesse.The true merits stand out in the quality of its production and because it looks quite good, but that's pretty much it, so this thriller/drama gets stuck and never takes off.Nothing worth mentioning, but I found it a lot better than The Voyeurs."

      "text": "Birds of paradise- a new R rated movie. As practice shows- the R movie is or best (Kingsman franchise or fight club for example) or worst like Moonlight. Unfortunately, Birds of paradise is a classic cliched story that may find fans in future, so 4 out of 10"
