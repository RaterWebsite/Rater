      "text": "I'm a bit biased, having loved the book since I was in elementary school, as early as the third grade when my parents bought me my own copy because I loved the book.    It was my first \"novel\" so to speak, even if it was geared somewhat toward younger readers.    Not that Madeleine L'Engel didn't propose some silly ideas in her book  (defining the \"Mrs.'\" characters as former stars didn't make sense even when I first heard it, but it didn't take away from the overall imagery and storyline), but as usual Disney Studios have a way of sanitizing, omitting and ultimately ruining this adaptation a second time, after an even worse earlier version that was so bad I couldn't believe it.    We don't expect movie scripts unless they're bios or historical to follow to the letter the books they use for their movies, but this is ridiculous.    There is no mention of the Murry twins, Sandy and Dennys, who would be in a book of their own later.    Charles Wallace was not adopted, and Meg's father disappeared as a part of a military experiment with several other scientists, and they were not part of NASA.    Further details include the \"Mrs.\" Whatsit, Who, and Which as young, and Whatsit a young first time whatever she is, which is the opposite of her book personality, very very old, as are the others.    In fact, in the book, while Mrs. Which is the strongest of the three, she barely if ever materializes completely, and then in a typical witch form.    But Disney really blows it as their version of Meg and Charles Wallace are so far from the book characters it's maddening.    Meg was angry - smart, and much more impetuous in the book, and Charles Wallace was more vulnerable, and likable.    The boy playing him does okay, but comes off as a young smartass most of the time.    The worst thing they did was screw around with Camazotz, a planet controlled by an evil entity called It.    It didn't suddenly change backgrounds like the movie claims.    The cul-de-sac with the automaton children did not convey the sinister behavior of It controlling their every breath and movement, along with the rest of the city where the kids had to go to find Meg and Charles Wallace's father.    The book had a far more sinister feel - all identical buildings that didn't fold up, then to apartment style buildings as they neared the city center, and finally the skycrapers, all identical, except for the monolithic CENTRAL Central Intelligence building, higher than any building on Earth and just as wide and deep.    Here is where the Man With The Red Eyes encountered them, not on a beach with a stupid Wizard of Oz reject who takes them to a single room instead of the great building.    Believe me - the millions of us who loved the book I'm positive thought these plot aberrations were silly and distracted from the menace of the story.    Your kids might think it's okay, but I hate this movie.    It fails every which way to convey the dangers of the book, removes the cold sinister feel of Camazotz, and falls woefully short of doing the classic book justice.    Maybe if some film company besides that lukewarm Disney could give it a go, but I doubt anybody will.    Not even Chris Pine or Reese Witherspoon can save this dog."

      "text": "Overall not a great movie. Lacks the basics needed for story telling. No character has any development. The characters never actually solve a problem. The villain had no motivation or purpose. And the solution was the power of love, which is just lazy story telling. The tone was consistent with that of a soap opera. Scenes that were trying to be magical were just dull.At one point of the main characters becomes a flying lettuce. This scene took up about ten minutes but didn't lead to anything. Nor did it come up again. It was pure fluff.At no point did any main character solve a problem.  A lot was grown at them but they were basically completely passive in a solution. The villain also did not have clear motivations as to why it wanted to kidnap the main character. But it was defeated by love.There were no subtlety in any narrative or character. If a character had an insecurity you were directly told. If they overcame this you were not shown this but instead directly told this. It's just bad story telling."

This film had to have been a turning point for her career, a defining moment for an African-American female director leading a huge 100 million dollars production but the result is perhaps the first great disappointment of mainstream cinema in this 2018.Frankly I don't think it's the disaster that many people have said it is, but it's a film that lacks of direction. Visually is beautiful but it has a formation and rhythm that affects the development of the whole film and the truth is that it ends up consumed by its own ambition. Ambition that was unable to exploit with the best quality.Considering that Disney is drowing audicences with sequels and franchise development, is remarkable they tried this but the end result was sadly disappointing."

      "text": "I see so many people champion this movie as important because of what it represents as a step forward for representation, with Ava DuVernay being the first black female director to direct a film over $100 million, and being a high concept fantasy film with young black female lead. Which I can respect. But here's the thing...it is true that black girls deserve a film like this. But they also deserve better! They do not deserve a poorly acted, poorly written, safe, pandering, no stakes film that is only made to make a franchise that this pap is! Like this is really bad and the fact people are seriously giving this film a pass for **** identity politics makes me sick! That's not moving forward, that's blatant tokenism and I will not stand for it!The acting is all around awful! And I do not mean from the child acting, which yes they are terrible! Storm Reid is wooden, Pan survivor Levi Miller is awkward, and Deric McCabe honestly feels like he came from a Disney sitcom (he wasn't, but still my point stands). But honestly I think they might be better than the adult acting, which outside from Chris Pine (who is too good for this movie) and Reese Witherspoon, is just embarrassing. Oprah is underacting, which is surprising from a force of personality like her, Mindy Kaling is miscast and flat as hell, Zack Galifianakis is not even trying, Michael Pina is only in this film for like 5 minutes and even then he's just awkward, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw outside of one scene is just terrible.I cannot believe Ava DuVernay directed this, and I mean I legit refuse to believe she did because this feels like a half assed studio directed job. Some of the shots are decent, but she was the wrong choice for this. The movie needs to have a surrealist touch like Terry Gilliam or Alejandro Jodorowsky, not someone who is known for making grounded, serious dramas like Selma and Middle of Nowhere. There are a few shots where she is close to that, but overall this film feels lazy from a directorial standpoint. And speaking of lazy, holy **** the green screen compositing is dreadful! Like some of the worst from a major motion picture that I have ever seen all year! The worlds the characters go to look great, but it is so clear that they are on a green screen set and not in these beautiful planets. This cost over $100 million and it is flushed down the drain!But I do not blame DuVernay for this. I blame it squarely at Disney! This is the second the titular book was adapted from the company, the first being a terrible made-for-TV adaptation from the early 2000s, and it is clear that they are going for yet another high concept adventure film like John Carter, the Lone Ranger, and Tomorrowland, desperate for another Pirates franchise. They should stop because they all are box office disasters! I remember reading the book but barely remembering a large portion of it, but what I do remember is one scene where the main girl sees the life of her love interest (who A, just pops in and have no real reason to be there other than he just tagged along, and B, they have no chemistry what-so-ever) and she sees that his mother abuses him and his siblings, which was a huge moment because this perfect guy has his walls broken down and seeing what he considers a flaw. That never happens in this movie. They completely brushed it aside because that might be too much for families and it will hurt their FEE FEES. What I am getting at is that there is no sense of danger in this film. Even if the visual effect integration was amazing, I would never feel that there was a sense of tension with anyone. They always end up just fine in the end. Like there has to be any sense of grit or an element of stake in a movie to has the audience care, but if nothing bad ever happens to them besides forced conflicts in the third act, then why should I bother caring. Like I said before I don't blame DuVernay for this because more than likely this was micromanaged to **** by Disney to make the safest, cleanest, non-threatening film they could. It's the equivalent of dangling keys in front of the audience, along with poorly integrated pop songs (all originals and all awful) or a cheap and bland movie score.I remember hearing that the author of the book wanted to make a book that was about exploring complex themes of physics to young readers so that they can understand, but that barely gets addressed, or whenever it does the dialogue is so poorly written that they just flat out spell it out to the audience. The writing in general is dreadful, watering down any element of the book to cringe-worthy lines about love and weird gibberish that Oprah mumbles out of her monotone mouth.Like how the hell can you make a big budget blockbuster worse than the lame made-for-TV film made over a decade ago? Clearly Disney found a way with their toothless, virtue signal of a film!"

The special effects were interesting but they never felt \"real\" - like say Jurassic Park seemed believable. You were aware of the special effects and were tempted to figure how how they did that.

All it relied on was CG effects, nothing more. The only reason I watched the whole thing was because I wanted to see how the kids find their father by just walking through the entire universe. Supposedly he had been missing for 4 years and was found crouched down in some tunnel. How long was he there for? Well, he looked pretty healthy and sane and clean for someone lost in the bad part of the universe with absolutely none of his basic needs met, like food or water. I liked the character of Meg and the girl who played her did a great job considering the terrible script. But that was the only character. The rest were absolutely ridiculous. Why keep casting the same faces over and over and over and over again? None of the dialogue or silly quotes made sense. As for Calvin, that was just total cringe. This \"gorgeous guy\" just happens to come along for this bizarre ride, just for the sake of trying to turn this movie into a romance somehow? Stop leaving out substance and realism and replacing it with corny romantic possibilities Disney! This movie needed to expand on the key concepts but it kept getting side tracked by \"stunning\" visuals."

However, I recommend you just watch some other comedy instead. The CG was horrible to look at and was overall very distracting, on top of this, many things didn't make sense logistically and plot-wise. The movie couldn't make up its mind about what it wanted to be, is it a dumb kids film (yes, but not in an intended way) is it an action flick, is it a comedy, is it a drama, or what is it. It turns out its none of these things, in fact, it is not much of anything. This movie is utterly incapable in every department, it fails to not only to capture the nature of the source material but also fails at being a comprehensive piece of film. Please avoid this one, the plot is nonsense, the characters are generic and cliche. Overall the movie is just an ineffective leech that has no purpose, is self-redundant, and involves no apparent genuine talent."

      "text": "The first act provided us with a very thin and clich\u00e9d background of the story and the characters, but the worst thing about the first act in general is that the directing and the camera work in it is so bad; weird camera angles, cranky camera movements. That's often noticed in scenes which feature conversations between characters. I felt if I was watching documentary or something, and that made me so confused and I really felt uneasy. There are tons of plot holes and unexplained things from the get-go to the end of the movie. But most of the nonsensical things happened to be related to the character of Charles Wallace. Charles Wallace is a very bizarre character. This character and everything related to it don't make any sense ,alas, Charles Wallace is really a big deal in the story and its messy plot. To add insult to injury, the child who played this character, Deric McCabe, is a very bad actor; for a big part of the movie he was trying to act like a cool sweet young kid, but he is not, then we see him overacting. I wonder if this character, Charles Wallace, is also poorly written in the novel? Mrs. Which, Whatsit, and Who characters have many cringe-worthy moments, and I blame no one but the director, Ava DuVernay, and maybe also Mindy Kaling (Mr. Who) who I should blame; what an annoying character and infuriating performance from Mindy Kaling!I don't have so much to say about Zach Galifianakis or Pe\u00f1a's performances, but I didn't neither like their characters.I think Storm Reid who played Meg, the protagonist, did a really god job. But the only performance that I can really praise is Chris Pine as Meg's father; he is great and due to his performance, the dramatic and the emotional value, which I didn't get, became slightly better. There are very few scenes where the CGI was okay, but, in general, it's weak and cartoonish, and that's due to the bad green screen that is glaringly obvious.I liked the comprehensive concept of the evil as an antagonist, but what we got from it in the third act was disgraceful! I really suffered while watching this act with all its dull and illogical twists.I'm very disappointed! I haven't watched many movies that have been released this year, but this is definitely the worst one of them so far.From now on I'll call this movie A Wrinkle in Logic!(4/10)"

There's a cheesy \"be yourself and believe in yourself\" message that feels tacked on, and not truly genuine.

      "text": "Not being familiar with the book, I had no idea what to expect. Having seen the trailer (too many times), I assumed Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling would be the guiding forces. However, the 3 stars bow out about half way thru and leave the quest to the young people. A girl, her brother and their friend set out across the universe to find her scientist father. There are expected otherwordly visuals. Although they're sometimes pretty, none of them is especially dazzling or groundbreaking. More of a disappointment is the leaden pace, dreary earnestness and never-ending messages of self worth and empowerment.  A spectacular disappointment."

With one character having to be 2-3x bigger than the others, the film is about them not the book.  Ridiculous film."

      "text": "The road to mediocre movies is paved with good intentions. Ava DuVernay is a master publicist and one of Hollywood\u2019s reigning social media mavens, so it\u2019s not surprising that her take on \u201cA Wrinkle in Time\u201d plays like a live-action adaptation of your cool aunt\u2019s Instagram account. It\u2019s an intermittent and repetitive scroll through a series of photoshopped images, overly-obvious inspirational quotes, celebrity fashion spreads, new-agey pseudo-science, self-help clich\u00e9s, \u201cplease like me\u201d generalities, and smarmy \"haters gonna hate\" defensive posturing. Just when you\u2019re annoyed or bored enough to unfollow, you get sucked back in with some surprisingly cool content, like a moment of pure artistry, a genuinely inspiring Oprah-branded \u201cAha!\u201d moment, or a dreamy new Sade song. The movie does an adequate job of dutifully hitting the main plot points of the novel, but it\u2019s treatment of the story\u2019s complex themes is only skin deep. Tellingly, the three Mrs. W\u2019s have been translated here into a trio of intergalactic glamour-pusses, characterized primarily by their outward appearance, costume changes, and connection to pop culture. Such materialism is perhaps necessary when translating a largely abstract novel to the screen, but when overdone, as is the case here, it becomes distracting rather than illuminating. I\u2019d recommend this movie for DuVernay or Disney diehards and tweens in desperate need of a crash course in standard self-esteem and lowest-common-denominator courage. For everyone else, skip the movie and read the book. Your own imagination will surely create something better. (And you can always go ahead and download that new Sade song.)"

The performance by the supporting cast feels like they could have casted anyone else and it wouldn't have made a difference. Storm Reid is by far the best of the movie, and her story is the most compelling. However, it isn't enough to save this trainwreck of a movie. Very dissapointed."

      "text": "Dissapointing. \"A Wrinkle in Time\" suffers from a lot of flaws. To be honest, I'm surprised the script got passed by the producers. It's weird but the exhibition in this film is either too much or not enough, so I was at either \"I get it, move on!\" or \"Wait, what!? Explain!.\" The dialogue among the humans just doesn't sound like how regular human beings speak. It doesn't help that the kids who play the three main characters aren't good actors. The two boys in particular are wanting. Between the acting and the dialogue, the love interest kid is a wedged-in, purposeless dummy, and the super-intelligent younger brother is obnoxiously precocious and a bit hard to understand sometimes.The film does have some strong parts. All the big name actors who play the alien beings did a great job. In fact, this was probably my favorite performance by Reece Witherspoon as a weird, unintentionally rude alien. Visually, the effects, the costumes, and sets are all a joy to watch. Lot of creativity there.In fact, I liked the second act. The focus on the aliens and other planets are when things got good. Unfortunately, the third act focuses on the human characters again and falls into the mistakes of the drawn-out first act.Kids may enjoy the visuals here, but If you're a parent be prepared to be bored for part of this."
