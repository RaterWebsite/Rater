The people behind this movie are fans and they did the best they could to explain what happen. This is the best Video game to movie I have seen in a very long time. Dont miss it!"

      "text": "Silent Hill is a video game adaptation and it deserves plenty of praise for its efforts in staying true to its roots. All the critics' that bashed the movie have obviously forgotton some of the terrrible video game adaptations of the past (e.g. Street Fighter, Resident Evil) The writers from these took a decent storyline and turned it into garbage. There's nothing wrong with staying true to game plot, that what some of us want. Almost all book adaptation regurgitate the whole novel and receive good reviews but vdieo games' movies that does the same get stepped on. Maybe the critics that wrote these terrible review should actually play the game FIRST before writing up a review about the movie. If they say the acting is bad, than maybe they should rewatch Harry Potter and look at the \"OVERACTING' and reconsider the high ratings that they gave the film. Silent Hill was enjoyable, it is a good piece of entertainment for the weekend and for those of us that played the game you will appreciate the efforts that were put into this movie. The Critic's are obviously narrow minded and only believe films \"inspired\" by true events are worthy of good reviews........making money on a tragedy that happen in 2001 on flight 93 sure make the families of the victims very happy. Oh, and maybe Hollywood writters and directors should come up with original ideas and stop making bad movies from adaptations. Before they do that, they should take back their bias opinions and reconsidered bashing a game adaptation movie that is saving their butts in the box office."

      "text": "Another example of the type of movie that critics don't like and the general public love. The problem with all the people with their comments being \"nonsensical storyline\" is that they either know it's a video game adaption, and don't think deep into it, or just can't make sense of it because you have to actually *gasp* think! Some of the best cinematography is here, as well as the best atmosphere in any recent movie that I can remember. The story, by no means stupid or nonsensical, requires you to think about every character and pay attention to little details, and eventually it all falls into place. I found myself more than confused at some parts, but then it clicked and everything made sense. So, in conclusion, this is a movie that people who are actually normal will appreciate. It has breathtaking cinematography, a suspensful, deep, and frightening storyline that deal with religious fanatics, condemnation, judgement, retribution, and revenge. Oh, and to all the people who think the creatures are CGI and look fake, most of them are actors in latex suits and costumes, with little touches of CGI here and there. What, humans in latex don't look real?"

      "text": "This is an intriguing film. The visuals are stunning and disturbing. The sound design is phenomenal. All of this you've heard before. So, I figured I might address some of the other critiques.The mixing of live actors as well as CGI for the monsters was brilliant-- Acting: I actually think the Rhada Mitchell, Laurie Holden and Alice Krige were really good. The rest were okay. Confusing Storyline: The movie has a story...and it isn't nearly as confusing as a David Lynch film. But the thing about horror is that over-explainations often ruin things. Generally, I think Silent Hill is working a certain type of Horror...it is a type that we don't see a lot--but I also think the film brilliantly misdirects what sort of horror it is. This is not a slasher flick, it is not a ironic take on the horror genre. It also isn't exactly a gore-fest. Like Lovecraft, this is a film about isolation, about helplessness, about madness, about obsessions, about religion...it is about disorientation. The horrors are there, but sometimes they are grainy and hard to see...and then sometimes they are right up in your face. The film also has a European style horror pacing (which tends to be a bit slower than American), and works Twilight-Zone/David Lynch style ambiguity. And the film is scary. I think it should be seen in the theatre with a great sound system. I know that the film has gotten lots of negative reviews...but I dont' think the reviewers are watching it in the right spirit. Silent Hill is not about realism, but about surrealism. And that is pretty cool."

      "text": "Rating this movie a 27/100 is preposterous. This is by far the best videogame adaptation yet to the big screen, with some of the most detailed cinematography yet seen in any horror movie. Thats the problem with most of these reviews. Most of these critics have probably never even touched a videogame in their life. Most of the gripes about the movie has been about the confusing ending, 'bad' acting, and the overall corniness of the dialogue. I'm not making excuses or alibis here, but personally I loved the script of the movie simply because it stayed amazingly true to the games. The acting in the games were 'bad', the dialogue was 'bad', but thats the point. This movie is extremely stylized, and stayed true to its roots. Fans may complain about some plot changes but damn't, its a good thing cause it means theres gonna be sequal with the way it ended. I personally can't wait."

Unfortunately however, despite far too much exposition and explaining of back stories, the plot doesn't make much sense and isn't particularly interesting anyway (something which is even more frustrating since the second video game in the series has a pretty decent storyline) meaning parts of Silent Hill can be a bit of a chore to sit through.\r Some horror fans may enjoy it but In the end this is yet another example of a video game license being mis-used."

Well I'm an expert on Silent Hil, and I'm telling you right now, this movie doesn't even come close to the story of the game. It's not even interesting. There's a few interesting visuals and like half of the movie is boring. The story of Silent Hill in the game is about a cult that lives in Silent Hill and they are trying to birth a demon god through one of the members psychic daughter, Alessa. The movie has nothing to do with this. Alessa is good and in the movie they made her the villain? What? They also made Alessa an evil girl who just wants to torture people and kill them. Trust me, if you want to see this movie because you like the games, you will be very disappointed. If you want to see this movie because you think it's good, it's not.

Also there is no reason the movie had to be 2 hours long, it could have been wrapped up in 1 h 30 min,\rIn the end, if you liked the game then you are probably going to like the movie, if you haven't played the game or didn't like it, then the movie is meh, it really needs your imagination to help with the movie, it isn't naturally that terrifying."

The acting is pretty good, though Jodelle Ferland who plays Sharon really isn't.The film is too long and it loses all momentum whenever it cuts to Sean Bean's character. There's a fanedit that is shorter and removes all of Bean's scenes and apparently it's pretty good, so I might have to give it a watch.This is a movie that's better to look at than to actually watch. It gets very repetitive and I kept losing interest, but it sure does look creepy.The sound and music are also very good (though I did notice one line that sounded like it was composited from two different takes and it sounded really bad).Overall, this is one of the better videogame adaptations, though its flaws still keep it from being more than average, which is still a big step up from other films of its kind."

Those who said that didn't understand the idea of the movie, that it's just the same of the game. The story has to be twisted, unreal, and for those who said that \"It's a bad horror movie\"... you're wrong from the beginning...

I'm a huge fan of the silent hill series, and there are a lot of things this movie does right such as the art direction and the settings always look great through the whole movie. However there were many changes to the plot that I found unnecessary and caused it to lose the unique touch that the older games had. Also the script writing is very hit and miss, sometimes the dialogue is good, other times it falls flat on it's face. I know SH1 wasn't exactly a shining example of good script writing and voiceovers but that was a game made in the 90s. I will say that it's miles above many of the other game-to-movie adaptations and doesn't just feel like a cheap cash in. It just could have used a lot of improvements and I really wanted to see the actual story of silent hill 1 play out in a movie...

The atmosphere in the games is amazing. And I think they managed to convert it into the movie pretty well. The acting isn't bad at all either. Jodelle Ferland who seems really talented to me (based on her roles in Kingdom Hospital  Tideland) again is pretty steady in this movie although her role is quite small this time. Same as Radha Mitchell and Sean Bean act pretty decent. You can easily imagine the fear Mitchell (Playing the main character) is experiencing during her forced visit to lovely Silent Hill.

Yours and other critic's opinions on this film is irelevant in my opinion. Now for the movie: If you played the games religiously, as I have, then you will definatly appreciate what has been done in the transition to the big screen. It looks great, it sounds great and 99% of the time it just feels right. People who saw this movie with me who had never played the game left the movie really confused. Aside from the lame dialogue, and liberties taken with the story from the first SIlent Hill, this was my only gripe with the film. It is definatly for the fans of the franchise and everyone else is really left in the dark. That aside, everyone can agree that this movie does magicaly transport you into its foggy, gloomy world. And to be honest with you, I am glad that people who never played the games left the theater a bit confused because figuring out the truth about Silent Hill is what has made the games so great.

It is much like watching someone play the video game.

Its drawbacks are its somewhat incoherent story (suggest playing the game first for a much greater understanding of the movie),lackluster dialouge at times (though not as bad as critics say) and the aforementioned fact that the video game itself is more engaging than the movie. I must say that, though not that scary, it is superior to most of the recent horror titles out there at the moment due to atmosphere and a plot, though messy, will keep you entirely glued to the seat throughout the movie."

Based off the first game but uses monsters from the second(all the monsters in Silent Hill have symbolic meaning so using them in a different story contradicts that). This movie is untrue and an insult to the game and is just a unscary boring movie. If anyone's seen the Indiana Jones episode of South Park what happens in that episode is the best way to describe this movie."

I know complexity to story is rather beyond some film goers these days, so buy it on DVD and watch it several times, it may sink in then. This film is an adapted video game and shows great creativity with more creature creations from Patrick Tatapoulos who with Stan Winston have probably created some of the best creatures seen in film. In essence it is a film about revenge on religious zealots who \"kill\" a child. The young actress who plays three parts I last saw playing a ghost in Kingdom Hospital and clearly has no problem playing highly variable roles from a sweet child to the manifestation of evil.. This film is hauntingl beautiful with great incidentatl music and the ending, well try it."

The bad guys, like the nurses and the huge man with the long metal pieces are fantastic and the setting is creepy as hell. However, the ending gets bogged down in religion and back stories that no one gives a crap about."

I even played Silent Hill for two hours before going to this movie, just to ensure that I was in the proper frame of mind in which to enjoy the film. This was an abysmal movie. It was definitely the single worst film I have seen in 2006, and probably one of the worst films I have ever seen. It is Uwe Boll bad. It is poisonously bad. It was worse than Batman and Robin."
