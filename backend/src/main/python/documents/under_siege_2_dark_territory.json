      "text": "Okay so after I review the smash hit Under Siege the first film I have to review the second film which you both think it's not as good as the first, this is one of my favourites. It came out in 1995 where I was born and in some ways, yeah that's the way it is and in other ways it came out the same year as Pocahontas but in other ways the fight scenes are really great, in other ways it's fantastic, in other ways this is the best sequels ever made if not the best, oh boy, I'm just a sucker. The end fight scene is awsome and the train crash is absolutely fxxking awsome. Eric Bogosian is pretty good in it and Morris Chestnut is hilarious in it as well. This is the one that I can think whilst looking at my collection! Holy sxxt!"
