Just go watch this movie for the spectacular opening credits.\r Not only is Deapool a wonderfully acted superhero movie with a demented heart but also a sort of game changer that this genre needed for quite a while. With its extremely simple story, Deadpool is what most superhero movies should strive for. Instead of slapping us with end-of-the-world events, these movies need to focus on presenting us with a cohesive story that can work well on its own.\r And yes, Ryan Reynolds kills it."

So what do you expect from a Deadpool film? Exactly that. The film is childish, full if violence and gory with fart and piss humour, and a dozen 4th wall breakage. Exactly what a Deadpool film should be. If you expect a \"Avenger\" type of super hero film, you're watching the wrong film, and you've probably lived behind a rock for some time if you don't know what Deadpool is about. This film delivers where it's expected. It's not Interstellar, A clockwork Orange or any other type of \"awesome\" films. It's Deadpool, and it delivers exactly what you expect of Deadpool; childish humour with gore and fart jokes, including breaking the 4th wall more times than you care to count."

      "text": "Deadpool: \"From the studio that inexplicably sewed his **** mouth shut the first time, comes... me!\".\r One of the greatest anti-hero - the Merc with a mouth - Wade Wilson was once a special forces operative but turned mercenary. After being subjected to a rogue experiment, he finds himself with accelerated healing and transforms himself into Deadpool. Armed with weapons (and a wicked sense of humor) he will stop at nothing to track down the men responsible.\r Never have I seen so many fans (or moviegoers), dying to see a character like Deadpool on the big screen; it's a bit like how everyone wanted to see The Avengers on the big screen back in late 2011. It's bad enough that the studios can't seem to get the character right with the disaster that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But the respect and love that fans have for this character stayed strong until everyone's prays was finally answered by this movie. And it did not disappoint, because Deadpool lives up to hype by being entertaining and hilarious. While I don't think it's an A+ like Chris Stuckmann rated it or a masterpiece of all comic book movies, but did I have fun watching this movie? ABSOLUTELY. It's a film that fans wanted and got.\r I can't imagine anyone else in Hollywood playing Deadpool but only Ryan Reynolds. He was born to play this character and he's the only actor that I think of to do the character justice. Reynolds as expected did that, and that's make the character of Deadpool he's own. He was terrific has the mouth talking, ant-hero bad-ass. This is Ryan Reynolds come back role after his past disasters roles that mostly involves Green Lantern and Origins Wolverine (that this movie brilliantly makes fun off).  Reynolds was just perfect for this character and he did a great performance in this film. He delivered the comedic timing and the somewhat of a hidden charm that Deadpool has. Ryan Reynolds absolutely nailed it.\r The writing in this movie was surprisingly good, which I didn't expect for a movie with this kind of character. Of course there are Easter eggs, references and nods to the comics and Marvel movies, but in this movie it's done in such a way that feels kind of refreshing. I know for a fact that I missed a lot of the jokes and references due to amount of laughter that I had while watching the movie. I can say it with a brave face that the writing is this movies biggest strength, because it's self awareness on Marvel movies and itself was all top notch.\r I'm so happy that this movie is rated R and not some water down PG-13 movie, because if you honestly think a Deadpool movie should be rated PG-13, then you really don't know the character at all. I'm taking to you Grace Randolph. Just because some little eight year old boy (who probably doesn't know who Deadpool really is), whats to see the movie, but can't because he's not old enough to see it, doesn't mean it should be changed to a PG-13 for someone who doesn't even know the character of Deadpool. These fans have waited 7 or 8 years for this character to be done right, so this little boys mother should teach him some patience.\r Now for the flaws: How much better would this movie be if it had visual comedy. I mean Edge Wright should seriously do a Marvel movie, because I know for a fact that he will make the best Marvel movie ever when it comes to it's comedy, pasting and execution (something that Age of Ultron couldn't do). I highly recommend seeing Every Frame and Printing video on \"How to do Visual comedy\", because Tony Zhou knows some much about movies better then I do. But that's what I felt was missing in this movie and I know this is Tim Millers first big film (And an impressive one as well), but I'm just saying that it would be really brilliant if there was visual comedy in a movie with Deadpool.\r While I did think the writing was great, but some of the jokes in the movie I didn't find that funny. And no, it's not because I didn't get it or I didn't understand the reference, because all of the jokes and reference in this movie I understood clearly, it's just that I didn't find some of it funny.\r Overall Deadpool is a fresh, entertaining comic book movie that it's hard for any comic book lover not to like this movie. You bet I'll be seeing the squeal when it comes out since I know it's in good hands."

Ryan Reynolds kills it as \"The Merc with a Mouth\" and the ensemble cast is solid too, especially the X-Men: Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead. This is easily the funniest superhero movie ever, as Deadpool throws one liner after one liner and they all hit pretty damn well. The action is super fun too, finally giving the genre some blood to go with the action. My only con preventing it from being a 10 is Ajax, who falls a bit short as a villain. Overall, Deadpool did not disappoint and I strongly recommend any fan of superhero movies or R-rated comedies see this gem."

Action scenes come together in a perfectly orchestrated bloody slaughter, No other way to really put it. Things will happen that leave you speechless. The humor is also so perfect they know what was done wrong in the past and they fixed there wrong, Poking fun at things like a CGI suit, Sewing his mouth shut and a few others.It's also nice to see Marvel let them go with a R rating.

      "text": "A barrage of action and humor blend seamlessly, providing an immensely entertaining experience. The story features love and revenge, with well-paced flash-backs to the origin story of Wade Wilson as he becomes Deadpool. He is the 'merc with a mouth', and gaining his powers does little to change his personality; he is a selfish and damaged man who and hides behind his sarcasm. Both in and out of costume, he brings laughs as he chats up friends, enemies, a taxi driver and the audience. Deadpool is no typical movie adaptation of a comic book character. The film unapolegetically targets the young male demographic, and is nowhere near family-friendly like Spiderman or The Avengers. Deadpool, which is very R rated, is intended for mature viewers who enjoy extremely immature comedy in addition to over the top violence. It's not for kids, except the ones with 'cool parents' of course.\rDirector, Tim Miller, who has worked on the blockbuster video game series, Mass Effect, and one of my favorite films, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, strongly impresses in his first feature film. The CGI effects are well-utilized and Deadpool's signature style of breaking the fourth wall is a frequent treat. The plot and pacing provide a steady stream of fun with no lull's in the action. The film has its common themes and cliches like any, but makes fun of them to viewers as they occur, turning anything generic into a laugh. Be prepared for a vulgar, perverted and crude joke filled journey of over-the-top violence. If nudity or atypical sex scenes offend you, then beware. The satirical humor can be dark and twisted similar to South Park at its most extreme. Not all the comedic dialog lands flush, but the creatively colorful language from Deadpool and friends keeps the laughter coming. Both the visual and sound effects were fantastic, and the music fit well.\rRyan Reynolds feels perfectly cast as the quick-witted anti-hero. He is completely believable as the jokester, and shows his diversity in the more emotional scenes. Ed Skrein stars as the antagonist/villain, Ajax. Although the character is a prototypical British baddie, his back and forth with Reynolds is great. Ajax is regularly backed up by the ass-kicking Angel Dust, played by Mixed Martial Arts star, Gina Carano. Actor T.J. Miller provides comedic support as the best friend, Weasle. Morena Baccarin, who plays the role of Wilson's girlfriend, Vanessa, impresses in a silly and fun role in stark contrast to her work in V and Homeland.\rWhen Reynolds is Deadpool, he has another pair of supporting characters in the form of X-Men, Collossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead. The former is played by Stefan Kapicic and Greg LaSalle, who split the work between voice and physical acting respectively. The Latter, who I'll call NTW, is Brianna Hildebrand, who didn't even know what role she was auditioning for nor what her powers would look like on screen, but pulls it off well.\rThis movie is not for the easily offended, and not to be taken seriously. Entertainment value is what counts, and Deadpool has it in droves. It oozes originality from the advertising campaign all the way to the opening credits and post-film teaser. I can't think of another movie that entertained so consistently. Consumers have already cast their votes with their wallets, as Deadpool took in about $130 million this opening weekend, slicing up the previous box office record set by The Matrix Reloaded in 2003 by over $15 million. I recommend you view this film and see what the buzz is about, assuming you are an adult with a sense of humor. Disclaimer: I am not responsible for the corruption of any innocent souls that may result from watching Deadpool."

      "text": "Deadpool was just...WOW, when i walked out of the cinema i just couldn't believe how good it was as it had a small budget,was small scale and the movie was short for a superhero movie, but that's what made it good you can clearly see the director,producers and cast did great with the material they had.\r First off the humor..oh my gosh my humor was great,Ryan Reynolds is there perfect choice even before this movie we knew that(X-Men Origins Wolverine) and the dude brings the character to life with his portrayal .Even from the opening credits this movie starts to make you laugh and the first 10 minutes of this movie has the is best opening scene in a superhero origin story because origin stories are usually slow paced then improve to a faster pace, but this movie starts off with a fast pace and even when Deadpool isn't shown you never get bored because of the crude,rude humor,one-liners and characters in this movie.\r The rest of the cast's performances were good as well as the chemistry between Ryan's Wade Wilson and Morena Baccarin's Claire was great, you bought the romance these two characters had,cared for their relation as it was a weird and odd relationship.Wade's Friend Weasel was also decent comic relief and the two X-Men characters Colossus and Megasonic teenage warhead(yeah) fit perfectly into this movie.The villain Ajax portrayed by Ed Skrien was actually good, this guy was a generic bad guy, but worked for this movie as he was a threat to Deadpool and people around him(and the guy was an a**hole).\r What made this movie different from other superhero movies is the R-rating, at first i wasn't sure about it because from the trailers i thought they would go over the top with the R-rating, but i was wrong as this movie was better because of it, the gore,violence and of-course language was right for this movie even with some very EXPLICIT scenes it never feels out of place.The action was great, again the R-rating makes the action better and how can you not love a movie that opens up with an action sequence and one more thing to point out is even if this movie was part comedy it had some small scenes where the movie grew dark and i was really surprised by this because it fitted well and the intensity was amazing.\r Now the BAD, this movie had a few bad things about it like we all know Deadpool isn't a superhero more antihero because the man is a clear and there was this whole subplot in the movie where they tried to make Deadpool be a proper hero but you know it couldn't work as the subplot was just unnecessary and pretty obvious also i pointed out that the movie has good humor there are some scenes whereby the humor feels out of place at specially whereby the movie is supposed to feel intense it just doesn't work.Then there are some annoying filler moments whereby they tried to rub some humor but just felt unnecessary  and of-course with a small budget comes some bad CGI at times, but rather than that this movie is perfect.\r Deadpool is the perfect origin story for the character as the movie is funny,action packed,weird and just fun,the studio made up for that monstrosity in X-Men Origins Wolverine(they shut his mouth),didn't go over the top with the R-rating and the movie was just fun despite the small budget.Superhero fans with love this movie and non-superhero fans will have a good time-BRING ON DEADPOOL 2."

      "text": "I went into the movie expecting a raunchy version of a typical Marvel movie with a passable plot and plenty of action. And that's about exactly what I got out of it. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that great either. The story can be paired at the level of writing to, say, the first Captain America movie which is predictable and pretty uninteresting. The saving grace for this movie is obviously Deadpool himself and the humor that comes with him. I don't think I've audibly laughed out loud at a recent film as much as I did during this movie and who can blame me? Deadpool's character is pretty refreshing for the big screen. Overall, Deadpool's charm won me over to enjoy this movie despite the story."

      "text": "Now I know this movie is getting praised left, right and centre, but I find that it's being put on too high a pedestal simply because it's trying to be different and it's loyalty to the source material. Don't get me wrong, I really liked the film, it's just I expected more.\r The action is there. The jokes are there. Spot on casting, solid performances, yet, it feels like it's missing a real story. At its core, this is a Deadpool origin story. Nothing more, nothing less. A shames as it would have been nice if it had more to it than that. Also, the movie feels short.\r Still, bottom line is this movie is great, just hope the sequel has more substance.\r Overall:\rA fun movie that does the name proud, a shame there wasn't more."

Ryan reynolds nailed this character perfectly and the only donwside is i wish the film was longer. that's how good it was. the comedy, characters and effects were all fantastic here, no complaints. i don't want to spoil anything but the movie is paced very nicely and the comedic badass deadpool steals the show... obviously. if you like deadpool or comedic \"superhero\" movies that aren't for little kids then you owe it to yourself to see this phenomenal representation of Marvel's greatest anit hero. i rate deadpool 10/10 chimichangas"

This movie was violent, hilarious, with a pretty decent origin story. It was way better than I expected and is one of my favourite comic book movies."

      "text": "Deadpool was a great comic book movie (as even Deadpool claims it's not a superhero movie - he's not a hero). It had a very generic story, but the acting is great. Yup. Acting in a comic book movie is great for once. And then the jokes push the quality up even higher. It was funnier than Zoolander 2."

      "text": "Deadpool is proof that Fox can do a super hero film justice if they put their minds to it. After the abysmal Fan4stic; I was a bit nervous about this movie. The marketing was top notch but I dared to hope that the film lived up to the marketing. I couldn't be happier to say that Deadpool finally has delivered the Deadpool fans have been wanting. Not sewing his mouth shut was an excellent start.\r The movie earns its R rating with a copious amount of nudity, gratuitous violence and wanton profanity. Reynolds was born to play this character. The film opens by treating you to one of the best opening credit sequences ever. The film also manages a great balance of action, exposition and 4th wall self awareness. In fact its the 4th wall breaks that offer some of the films more entertaining moments. Reynolds even pokes fun at himself as well as his former movies like Green Lantern and other Marvel properties and indeed Fox themselves.\r The fact that Fox took the risk to make this film as they did should be applauded. It also bears mentioning that the supporting cast are good as well. Colossus is incredibly likable as is his young trainee Negasonic Teenage Warhead. My one criticism is that the villains themselves weren't all that interesting and were pretty obscure.\r The movie also has one of the best cameos of Stan Lee ever! If you love Deadpool you owe it to yourself to see this film. This was made for the fans. Also be sure to stick around through the end credits as well!"
