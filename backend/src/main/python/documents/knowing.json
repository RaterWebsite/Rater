In fact \"Knowing\" is the perfect title for it, because I _knew_ the whole story 10 seconds after the boy opened the envelope. So this whole thing was a waste of time. [THIS CONTAINS SPOLIERS!] It's a far below-average \"The world ends next Thursday\"-flick. And perhaps the plot-twist, that judgement day is upon Nicolas Cage, would have been surprising to someone, if they haven't already given it away in the movie-posters. You know that the world will end, that there is nothing Mr.Cage can do about it, you know that these guys are aliens and you know that they will take the kids with them and blahblahblah... the whole story seems to be assembled out of a \"screenplay-construction-kit\" or they just pulled cards with tags like \"aliens\", \"end of the world\" and \"foresight\" on it, and filled the gaps with special-effects. ...oh ok, well the special effects are good. So the movie feels like something M. Night Shyamalan and Roland Emmerich threw up on a tequila driven night."

Further to this the plot of this film is dire, the first 30 minutes are quite good, which is why this film gets 2 stars instead of 0, but after that the plot decends into madness and the director manages to get out of his own labyrinthine plot by using aliens/angels and explaining nothing very well at all. do not waste your money on this film."

Yes that's right the entire plot of this movie is 100% pointless once you see the ending, so why did I waste all of my time trying to understand the meaning of everything happening up to the ending, because I was stupid to rent it! I won't spoil the ending for you just in case you feel like wasting almost 2 hours of your life but the only highlight of the movie was a cgi plane crash somewhere in the middle of the movie (again, this was totally pointless to the ending). Even the critics were kind in their reviews!"

SPOILER ALERT - if higher beings know the future, can travel through space, etc, then why choose all this weird ambiguous whispering and symbolic nonesense to get people to do as they're told. It makes less than no sense. Plot wise this is complete drivel, only some ok CGI saves about five minutes of this movie. Cage is terrible, mostly because his lines are so stupid, at times he actually explains plot points out loud as if the audience were as dim witted as the writers. Avoid."

Without giving away any spoilers the end just doesn't make sense and there's a nasty anti science subtext (He's a bad father because he's a scientist?). On top of this the effects and acting are seriously sub par. There is also the somewhat offensive use of real life disaster-esque footage for entertainment purposes with far too many essentially pointless shots of horrific daths. I can't even recommend this as a so-bad-its-good film. I honestly don't understand how anyone thought this was good. It's not entertaining, thought provoking or inspiring. It's just bad. I want my money, and worse, 2 hours of my life, back."

Is Hollywood so clueless about real religious experience that it thinks it proceeds from depression to complete skepticism to fanatical certainty based on some numbers scrawled by a young girl and placed in a time capsule 50 years earlier. It;s enough to give credibility and substance to Bill Maher's adolescent view of religion in \"Religulous\". However, Proyas can still direct a great action sequence."

The story line was interesting, the CGI off the chain, and the ending somewhat surprising. In truth, I believe the conflict between the users overall score and the metacritic score turns on the anti-religious posturing of many media critics. I'm not making any value judgments for or against religion or spirtuality - merely commenting on most media critics response to movies with underlying spiritual themes (see the LA Weekly review)."

      "text": "When I started watching this movie I was excited. Finally, a good sci-fi movie, with touches of suspense and horror, and a nice tension. In fact, the two major strengths of this film are the visual components (airplane disaster or scenes of looting crowds, closer to the end, are visually impressive, for example) and the central idea of \u200b\u200bthe plot: a numeric prophecy investigated by a skeptical mathematician. The problem is that the good things in the movie end here.From the middle, the film loses quality. With prophecies solved the plot thread ends. From there, the film extends because it has to close the story anyway, giving rise to plot holes the size of houses and inserting immense religious symbology for no reason. I read a comment that said the movie is full of subliminal propaganda to Church of Scientology... well, I actually detected symbols with religious connotations, but I'm not an expert in subliminal messages or in that sect to properly identify a connection to a specific cult. Another problem is the hammy and unnatural performance of Nicolas Cage, who ceases to be skeptical too suddenly and unbelievably. At the beginning of the film, he lectures at MIT in which he approaches determinism and coincidentality... even this could have been best used in the script! The film is loaded with CGI of fairly medium quality, but the end is more worthy of a computer game than a movie."
