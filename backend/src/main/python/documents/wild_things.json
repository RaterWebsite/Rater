Spoilt rich kid accuses teacher Matt Dillon of rape, but that's the tip of an iceberg. Kevin Bacon investigates through several complexities. Bill Murray enjoys himself as a lawyer. There's a good deal of sex going on and the movie feels a little tacky, like a cheap diner or '80s fashion; but somehow it seems appropriate.

There is also something to be said for mysteries, with twists and turns, that make you think, but a half hour into this thing, it was easy to figure out why none of the stars came back for the sequels. This movie certainly plays up the eye candy angle, with two of the most beautiful women in Hollywood, and at first glance, it seems like it's going to be a pretty good film, but then the twists and turns kick in. Throwing in a twist can make an ordinary film spectacular, but when you do it every five minutes, it just confuses the hell out of the audience, and that's what happened here. By the end of Wild Things, I didn't know what the hell was going on anymore. As for the performances, they range from the brilliant Neve Campbell to the horrid Matt Dillon, and feature a ton of cameos in-between. I wanted to like this movie, there are some very good looking people, who like to take their cloths off, and that does tend to help you focus more, but the question is what are we focusing on? I concluded that there really isn't a reason to watch two hours of pure  when you can find all the naked celebrity pictures you could ever want, in five minutes online."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Starts out very promising but the plot does get a bit far fetched as it progresses along. There are a few too many twists. This does hurt the credibilty of the film. The cast is good, Denise Richards is a knock out. Great location footage."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Good entertaining movie with classic elements of a sex thriller, especially Denise Richards was sexy. But in my view there were too many plot twists, that makes the whole story a bit unrealistic. Bill Murray was the best."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Entertaining, sexy, bull murray and a great mystery come together in this drama with an excellent cast and fascinating screenplay. Sadly the abuse of the double cross heist tactics get taken way too far leading to levels of ridiculousness that detract massively from the impact of the interesting if overcooked character work and world building cinematography."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Ah faut reconna\u00eetre qu'on a une distribution bien sympathique avec en t\u00eate de gondole (\u00e7a doit \u00eatre le produit d'appel qui fait \"vendre\" et tourner les t\u00eates) la \"merveilleuse\" Denise Richards d\u00e9couverte par le pervers Paul Verhoeven dans le d\u00e9jant\u00e9 Startripes Troufions !
