But I haven't seen the movie yet, I've heard it's a good Disney movie and it may not be the best Disney movie just yet, but the animators just did a fantastic job on how the film just took exactly 10 years before the film's release in 2002 and the story looks a little familiar, but the acting is great, the CGI elements are incredible and even though it's still a cult following as of today, I think I might give it a go and buy it on Blu-Ray. Treasure Planet is a must-see. Maybe one of the most underrated movies in Disney history."

      "text": "Treasure Planet has not been greeted with negative reception, by any means. But compared to other Disney films, the response has been lukewarm at best, and Treasure Planet was a major box office flop. But here's the catch: It's really good. Like, really, really good. Treasure Planet is inspired by the Robert Louis Stevenson's classic, Treasure Island. Having not read the book myself, I cannot judge how closely the movie follows the book (my guess is not much due to the fact that this is an outer space adventure), but it provides a wonderfully entertaining yarn anyway. Jim is something of a rebel, but it's mostly his Dad's fault for leaving him and his mother at such a young age. Jim is constantly in trouble with the law, and his mother doesn't know what to do with her nearly-adult son. But when Jim gets a map from a deranged sea captain, Jim hopes to redeem himself and bring back the gold of Treasure Planet. A canine friend named Doppler tag along, as the two sail on a ship with a questionable crew, a cyborg cook named Mr. Silver, the captain named Amelia, and a host of others. The characters are instantly memorable. Yes, we have the stereotype \"cute\" character in the form of a shapeshifting alien named Morph. Yes, we have the stereotype villain in the form of a sneaky spider named Scroop. And yes, we have the stereotype \"humor\" character in the form of a robot named B.E.N. (who I didn't find all that funny at all). But there's a slew of original characters elsewhere. The protagonist, for example, Jim is a slightly different glove than the kind Disney usually likes to wear. Far from perfect with a messed up moral compass, Jim is rebellious, and doesn't like to take orders, but we see him change throughout the movie into a much more respectable chap. Likewise, Mr. Silver, who is the film's primary villain, never really knows if he wants to help Jim, or deploy his villainous plot to take the booty of Treasure Planet for himself. He's an interesting villain, far more interesting than almost any other villain that Disney has brought us so far. The visuals are incredible. Stunning. Really some of Disney's best. The same technology used in Disney's, also gorgeous, Tarzan film has been employed here with even better results. CGI backgrounds and often props mix with traditionally animated characters creating a visually superb film. And of course, Treasure Planet is hilarious. While B.E.N. is more than a tad annoying, he has some redeeming lines, and there are lots of other humorous characters as well. Captain Amelia gets a lot of great lines, and Doctor Doppler is equally funny. The score was unexpectedly wonderful. This is really some of Disney's best work in the music department. Composed by James Newton Howard (a composer I've had mixed feelings about), the score balances emotion and playfulness skillfully, applying enough strong, triumphant tunes as well for some of the more grand scenes. Unfortunately for Treasure Planet, there is a montage that occurs just before the halfway point, that was just screaming for the score to kick in and deliver the musical masterpiece to get it nominated for Best Original Score. Alas, Treasure Planet has decided to insert an incredibly irritating lyrical song instead. The song has an extremely loud and annoying sounding drum section, and an ill-fitting electric guitar. What could've been the centerpiece of the film, turns out to be the worst part, and this really is a shame. Treasure Planet shocked me by delivering one of Disney's best films so far. There's an abundance of memorable characters that you really care about, beautiful animation, and it's naturally hilarious. And while these are all important traits for a film, Treasure Planet also has something even more important: A heart. Treasure Planet doesn't settle for artificial sentimental stuff that so many other films have adopted and use only to attract a broader audience. Treasure Planet brings us a genuinely emotional film that I will not soon forget."

This film is beautifully made, it has great visuals for a 2-dimensional animated film and I like the whole concept of it being a space themed version of the classic novel Treasure Island. Unfortunately this film was a flop in the box-office and it's such a shame that not a lot of people gave this movie a chance; so I insist that you to see this film if you haven't already. This is a misunderstood film that you should see."

Imagine this animation back in 2002, what did people think when they saw it? This was so ahead of it's time.

This movie is one of Disney's hidden gems, a truly underrated animated masterpiece that deserved way more appreciation back when it was released. The story is emotional, heartwarming, exciting, intense, it makes you laugh, cry, feel tension, it's the complete experience. This is an almost flawless movie.The animation is gorgeous, the mix of  heavy use of CGI and the 2D animation holds up surprisingly well even nowadays. Honestly looks better than some totally CGI Disney movies like Frozen.Most of the characters have a well developed personality and the chemistry between Silver and Jim is geniune and heartwarming. There are many characters and most of them are pretty one-dimensional, sure, but the ones that are important to the plot are likable, memorable and charismatic. Jim, the protaginist has an arc, he's a little unlikable at first but his character grows and learns and we see someone completely different once the movie comes to an end. B.E.N. is honestly a little annoying comic relief that ruins the pacing and tone of the movie a little bit but he has very little screentime so I'm okay with that and it doesn't change my opinion of the movie.The score and action sequences are amazing and exciting. The song \"I'm still here\" is one of my favorite Disney songs ever and just like this movie, it's pretty underrated.A movie that was overshadowed by CGI movies that were growing in popularity, I guess it came at the wrong time in animation history, because this is truly an animated masterpiece. One of my favorite Disney movies ever and one of my favorite animated movies of all time."

It spans both the \"classics\" era and the \"new animation\" era beautifully. It manages to have a level of depth that entices older viewers, while it stays kid friendly by having a basic plot that's easy to follow and humor that they can understand. It has a phenomenal cast and an outstanding soundtrack. I don't understand the reasoning behind the bad reviews this movie gets, but it definitely doesn't deserve it. It's a shame that it managed to slip through the cracks between the other kid movies that came out around the same time, and it deserves much more recognition than it has gotten. This movie is absolutely wonderful and I recommend it to anyone who likes Disney, old or new, enjoys good music, has ever been underestimated, and has dared to follow their dreams and prove themselves."

While it doesn't go anywhere near levels of depth the book had, but for a Disney Sci-fi take on it, it was very good. There is allot in the movie you need to take with a grain of salt, it is an animated movie about space pirates after all. If I had to make one criticism, then it would have to be the robot Ben. Martin Short's performance is just too over the top and it just doesn't feel right in regards to the rest of the characters in the movie. Overall: A great movie, that will always be one of my Disney favorites."

The visuals are a delight to look at, with a wide range of colours, and the art direction is much better than it is in most direct to video sequels. The music is lovely too, not the best score in the world, but I liked it. However, the story is very overly-familiar and some of the characters aren't quite as convincing as others. Be thankful that the voice talents are so good, like Tony Jay lending his distinguished voice as the narrator. Emma Thompson is lovely as Amelia and makes the most of some witty dialogue, and David Hyde Pierce impresses as well. Martin Short is good as BEN but his character isn't quite as appealing as the others, Morph was one of my favourites. I liked the idea of making Silver a cyborg, and Brian Murray does a respectable job, and Jim, while slightly bland to start with was appealing. All in all, a well done animated film, that is only let down by slightly unoriginal plotting. 8/10 Bethany Cox."
