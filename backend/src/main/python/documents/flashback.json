      "text": "This movie hits the ground running and expects that you are ready without questions during its hour and thirty six minute runtime. The problem is I have nothing but questions after watching it. It\u2019s atmosphere and filming aesthetic are rich and compelling, but the meandering storytelling isn\u2019t. I won\u2019t spoil it, there is an interesting and fresh take on what \u201ctime\u201d is that I found momentarily compelling here. My biggest problem with the movie is it\u2019s one that try\u2019s hard at times to hit that sweet spot where the dialogue has weight as if it\u2019s being carved in stone while it\u2019s being delivered on screen, but the devices used to move the plot forward come off as clich\u00e9 and obvious. You also don\u2019t really have time to build a relationship with any of the characters, but the movie is always leaning into the absolutely creepy vibe they achieved and it put me on edge the entire time I was watching. I\u2019m not sure that I cared that I was missing character development until after I was done viewing it. You hardly get much backstory for the lead yet you are thrown in different situations that don\u2019t always connect to the main thrust of the story that you are guided through. All of that said I still enjoyed it. It got a very big reaction from me at the end that I didn\u2019t expect. The melancholy score really helped with that. The movie is very nicely put together on the whole, beautiful even at certain points to look at. I don\u2019t know who I\u2019d recommend this for as I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever watch it again, but if you want to be mildly chilled without any real scares I\u2019d check this out."

I have no idea what the hell people are smoking that rate this low, but it's not the right stuff. Challenging art in this time always seems to get the short stick, but in the end who even cares anymore? To hell with them. This is beautiful and stunning in every way."

      "text": "This will probably sound a bit strange, but even in the face of things the film does well, and that are merely interesting, Flashback never seems interested in breaking the barrier of the common, and doesn't benefit from a good theme, so it ends up completely stagnant after a while.I did not find it dreadful or anything like that, but there's nothing to highlight either."

      "text": "First, we must relate to the story. If we can't relate, in this humble reviewer's opinion, then our critical observation is another experience of another's life experiencing other experiences of other lives. Critically, presentation by the film maker sets this story towards an explosion of reality taken across mind illusions and tossed back again into some kind of reality. Presentation of this kind of experience resonated with my own experiences by what and how our mind is capable of folding upon itself in nightmarish fashion.I would have found it difficult to view this film in light of my past mind numbing experiences if it were not for the Spirit of the Living God to ground all such experiences as earthly and having not the power given by our creator and peace of mind promised by our Lord Christ.It was not my intent to proselytize my belief but only to give a counter reality observation to a work of fiction mirroring reality felt by others.Character and acting wasn't fully developed but as I observed previously presentation brought an experience for my relatedness into a creation of story too powerful to ignore."
