The girl is in love with the person but he does not notice her or she does not make herself know, something happens and she either is thrust into his life or ends up lying to be close to him. In this case, Lucy Moderatz (Sandra Bullock) lies to the object of her affection (Peter Gallagher) family in order to get close to him and be near when he wakes up. You see Lucy saved  Peter Callaghan(the first object of her affection)  after he fell on the tracks and is subsequently knocked into a coma  they take him to the hospital with her in tow and the case of mistaken identity ensues his family thinking he is Peter's fianc\u00c3\u00a9e. If you think this sounds conventional and familiar well then you are wrong the only thing conventional about this picture is the set up to this touching and very deep romance story. At the very center of this film  \"While you were Sleeping\" is the rare romantic dramedy that  takes you by surprises  not by the fact that you can see what's  coming a mile away but by the fact that you did not see it coming makes all the difference.  Jon Turtltaub's \"While you Were Sleeping\" is a film at first I did not expect to like at all it seemed like nothing more than a standard, run of the mill romantic dramedy that would do  nothing more than just provide the usual story of a lonely love struck girl getting the man of  her dreams. However, after seeing this picture my opinion of this film completely changed I started seeing it for what it is an extremely charming, touching, heartfelt and funny film that is far beyond the standards of Romantic comedy flair. \"While you Were Sleeping\" is intelligent and daring it is not afraid to show its human side to show how vulnerable its characters as regular people can be. How they easily are hurt, you see in a typical romantic comedy the characters insult each other like there is no tomorrow they hurt one another repeatedly until they finally concludes that this is not how love works in fact it is the exact opposite its called hatred. The characters in this film  do not overtly insult each other  sure there are moments where they tease one another but for the most part they   are  a caring bunch  of people the most caring would have to be 0x Callaghan(Peter Boyle) who is one of the few Callaghan's that embraces Lucy from the get go. Boyle's character is a sweet yet feisty fellow who is not afraid to defend the ones he loves when needed, that is the key to this films excellence that is what makes it so real, so human, so warm and loving it is the vibrant characters. Without theses colorful cast of characters this film would sink into the low standards the sub genre is recognized. \"While You were Sleeping\" is a film that can not be missed or ignored  it is just too good to be true and to funny and sweet to resist and even though I knew this film was going to have a happy ending, even though I saw where it was headed  I still found myself enjoying and loving every single minute of this beautifully drawn film.   This film is built from familiar ingredients   but this film has such charm and such spirit that no matter how much this film comes off as another rom-com dished out. You will love every single frame and every single minute of this film, the only other thing that saves this film is the magnificent performance from the ever-lovely Sandra Bullock. It is her performance that elevates this film that and the skill of director Jon Turteltaub and his team together they create a film that works better than it should and plays out far better than you could ever expect. The filmmakers do what seldom few directors do in theses films they put a human soul into it, they put real emotions and real feelings into this film that not only affects the mood of the movie but also affects the mood of the audience. If the characters are, arguing and fighting all the time than the audience can become agitated by this and turn there backs on the film. That however, is not the case with this film   you feel for the characters you sympathize with the characters you  even grow with them   as they find there sense o belonging in this world , or in the case  of Lucy Moderatz, her sense of belonging. That is what makes a good romantic dramedy and that is why others fail they do not capture the heart and soul the trials ad tribulations that come with the feelings of love. \"While you Were Sleeping\" hits all the right notes."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This movie has comedy and romance. It is also one of those movies I would call a \"feel good\" movie."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Strangely enough, my favorite holiday movie. coma-guys quirky family (headed by Peter Boyle) are unforgettable as a solid family unit. I mean that literally too...they seem to always move about as one unit. Perfect chemistry between Sandra and Bill, and I would kill for a chance to actually live out the slippery ice scene."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I love this movie! It's a classic romantic comedy."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "While You Were Sleeping can be described no other way than \"that cheesy 90's romantic comedy with Sandra Bullock.\" It's a throwaway Valentine's day movie night with the girlfriend or wife, boyfriend or husband: that's all it's good for."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "It's a predictable, generic rom-com, but I can't deny that it had me smiling the entire way through. Sandra Bullock's charm and warmness permeate the entire film. Bill Pullman and Sandra Bullock have such great chemistry, and their interactions are always hilarious."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Leading an outstanding cast Bullock excels in her rom-com debut, the main reason to watch this cuddly, classic love story. A farfetched script and overlength diminish the feel good effect."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "the finesse on weaving the structure..While You Were SleepingWhile You Were Sleeping is a plot driven romcom whose benign complexity is its strength unlike any other feature. The core is undeniably a typical textbook equation but it exfoliates the charm with one liners and hilarious humor rather than polishing it with flirty talk. And when it grows intense it holds onto you until you surrender yourself feeling a plethora of emotions where the primary one is satisfaction. The chemistry is the ace in the hole in such genre which it delivers unflinchingly in here but it's not among the lead characters that are at their best but side ones. Bullock and Warden are the perfect sensible teammates you will ever get on screen whilst Bullock's bittersweet relationship with Rispoli is the highlight of the feature. The narrative has a mockery tone that draws out the laugh from its uncertainty and unexpected outcomes from each character. The screenplay by Sullivan and Lebow is gripping, adaptive and sensible if not layered or thought provoking as the makers might suggest. It is shot beautifully with a true Christmas spirited theme that is pleasingly light and breezy to encounter but is unfortunately short on technical aspects like cinematography, background score and editing. Bullock as always delivers to the full with the help of a decent supporting cast like Boyle, Warden and Rispoli. The ironic humor, a sense of urgency and a good old romantic tale are the high points of the feature. The director Turteltaub is honest to its characters and storyline where he neither overchews it nor leaves it undercooked. While You Were Sleeping is surprisingly a very smart feature on terms of the finesse on weaving the structure with every bit of husky material it could scrape off from its characters and their sub-plots."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "This is very much basic rom com territory - it is cheesy, very unplausible and an easy watch. The plot is ludicrous but I went with it - its a bit of fun and sometimes thats just the ticket, so to speak. Its not in any way memorable and neither does it feature stand out performances or a believable storyline, as I say but its an alright watch, with some fairly amusing moments and as such, it could be worse I guess. There's not much else I could think to say about it really."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Insanely cheesy and overtly sentimental... yet, I kinda like 'While You Were Sleeping'.Sandra Bullock is probably the main reason for the latter, as she gives a near perfect performance for this sorta role. The rest of the cast are good too, from Bill Pullman to Peter Gallagher to Jason Bernard. The story is paced finely, it's really just the strong cheese that brings the rating down for me. Still: 7/10.It's the sixth Jon Turteltaub film that I've seen: I'd class each one as good. Reliable director!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The romantic comedy to define all romantic comedies. While You Were Sleeping is irresistibly lovable through its charming cast and a lovely story that more than lives up to its name."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "I must say simple surreal how it manages to be funny and witty while telling an emotional story. Truly something we all must strive for in our own writings.Peter is a hilarious character and his deadpan reactions to the world around him are superb. It's nice to see the family dynamic used so expertly for both comedy and a heart-wrenching story. Unfortunately, I swore to my sister when she made me watch this that I'd hate it, so to save face, 2/10 you non-miraculous son of a gun."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Hands down best romcom made to date.
