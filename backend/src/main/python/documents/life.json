      "text": "The thing I love about the movie Life is that it\u2019s not completely a comedy. It\u2019s what you would expect with a cast of comedians including, Eddie Murphy, Martin Lawrence, Bernie Mac and more. There are definitely funny parts but it also has a lot of sweet elements to it and a good plot. It\u2019s a typical story of two strangers in completely different lives that are forced together, except, these two are forced together for life in a prison. The movie spans almost 60 years but it never feels slow. It\u2019s a very enjoyable movie that is easy to see multiple times. Eddie Murphy and martin Lawrence give great performances and they work well together. I recommend it for anyone who wants a laugh and a good story."

      "text": "This movie is simply amazing. It is one of the most epic comedies I have ever seen, with vivid and diverse characters and many comedy greats. I am surprised that this is not better known for the amazing movie it is. It contains many deep themes one would not expect in a movie with Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence especially (considering some of his career moves). It also has many emotional and dramatic moments that supercede its purpose as a comedy. Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone have crafted one of the greatest surprises of the 1990's by making this movie encompassing and memorable. Sure, its slow. But it is also tender, and has a great ending. It doesn't deserve a 3.5 so I'm giving it a ten to restore confidence in what should be a classic."
