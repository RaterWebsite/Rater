Not only was it respectable to the source material, everything in the movie reflected what The Joker is, when you take Batman out of the story.  Fair warning:  the film is very graphic.  It holds nothing back.  Also dont expect a special fx show.  This is a sit down and shut up flick.  This is a film about madness, illness and sadness."

All thanks to Todd Phillips\u2019 inspiration from Martin Scorsese\u2019s Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, it is safe to say that this film is one of those films that will be talked about for a very long time. And there is no doubt that Joker can deliver a mature fish out of water story that is dark and psychologically brooding that every comic book fan needs to see. May the future of DC Black begin\u2026"

Honestly, when compared to other \"gritty\" and \"grounded\" dc comic book movies, this one actually works and is better than most. But, if you are going to compare it to something like taxi driver? Well then it's just average. It has some issues but nothing glaring. Overall I think everything works well. Not blown away but impressed."

      "text": "I went into this film knowing two things, the score from Icelandic composer Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir (friend of Johann and Chernobyl musical genius) meant the tone of this film was going to be glum at best and Phoenix throwing himself into all his roles would undoubtedly deliver. Both of things for me at least were spot on.The story is desperately sad if not a little predictable, my only really gripe being  the use of on screen notes to move the plot along at times, I find trying to nail which part I am meant to be reading takes the immersion out a little and I\u2019m pretty sure It happens on at least three occasions. Acting across the board is fantastic; I can understand why Phoenix has been called out by some reviewers but for my mind the Joker is meant to be over acted and his slow descent into madness is perfectly executed.Overall this feels like the sort of film you end up studying in English class, there is a lot to take in and you will have questions come the end. Not everyone will love this as it can plod a little at times but it\u2019s a needed plot that adds to the overall mood of the film."

You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we've never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we're almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he's the joker, we wish we could've helped him. There's a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. It had me shaking and disturbed for a long time after I left the cinema, and that can only be the mark of a great movie."

Doesn\u2019t glorify violence, (spoilers) with the main character being initially hesitant to take a gun from a coworker (first 10 mins of the movie) and he expected says he doesn\u2019t have any political stance and just manages to fall into place because of the public\u2019s reaction. Not a movie I\u2019m planning on seeing a millions times in my life because of it being so hard to watch someone fall like the Joker does, but it\u2019s a movie that needs an award. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don\u2019t need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie."

Jaquines' portrayal of a sociopathic, mentally unstable man's transformation to the iconic Joker was non other than a grippingly accurate, realistic and touching rendition. As unfortunate event after unfortunate event baraded the Joker leading to circumstantial wrong-doings, I truly felt for the character, while also being aware that his actions were wrong. Amidst the action packed superhero movies presented today (and as much as I do enjoy those as well) this movie is truly in a league of it's own.  Joker takes the lore and characters we have grown to love and revere as immeasurable beings, and throws it in your face as an all too real, true to life possibility."

A disturbing movie but powerful performance by Joaquin Phoenix is the beginning of new era.It is one of the best example on flim making... Pure art work with camera( Less VFX expenditure)Take a bow Todd Phillips for your excellent execution. Inspite of Todd Phillips's confirmation that Joaquin's joker won't meet Pattinson's Batman, I believe Todd and Joaquin,Both should reconsider their decision to unleash full potential performance against Robert's batman. Because joker needs batman in order to show his full potential. This movie is \"the raise of the joker.\""

The writing was absolutely amazing. The mood set for the different scenes and the slow uptick of this movie was absolutely on point. Phoenix deserves every accolade possible for this stunning portrayal. Would reccomend for anyone tha appreciates deep writing, dialogue amd the classic sense of how a truly timeless movie is put together!!!"

Remember those same people think that utter trash garbage like the last jedi or captain marvel were good movies. So go to see the Joker its the best movie about comic book character in many years"

Honestly... just when I was starting to lose faith in the movie industry this comes along and blows me away, it gave me that feeling of \"finally! A movie we've been desperately needing in the age of reboots and remakes and remasters and live cartoon adaptations and political correctness BS\" this is the direction the movie industry has to go and keep going. It's exactly what I personally always wanted as a Joker movie, a character study analysis about a broken man. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an award for his performance he killed it and honestly crushes all the previous Joker's that came before him that we've seen on screen and that's a huge statement. That laugh will send chills of disturbances down your spine every single time. It's a mix of sadness, confusion and just downright creepy I will even dare to say it's better than Mark Hamill's laugh. Make of that what you will. Acting? Superb!! Atmosphere and tone was perfect for this style of movie very depressing. Story? I won't spoil but it is very engaging, makes you think and you definitely feel for the Arthur. You'll be asking yourself questions even after the credits roll. No post credits by the way so don't sit through it. Music is a huge plus the composer really made the perfect soundtrack for such a film, she captures the mood and mentality of Arthur with every key note played a real treat. Loved it, I don't care what anyone says this is a 10/10 to me. If you love the Joker, or just a very good thriller about a broken man - watch this you won't regret it. Also - the snowflakes crying about wanting this banned because of violence? Ha... there was hardly any. I think other movies are worse in that regard, more drama than action if anything so no it won't promote a mass shooting or anything like that if anything it helps raise awareness on helping the mentally ill. Don't believe the fake news and mass hysteria, do yourself a favor - watch it and make your own judgement.Joaquin Phoenix man... that guy never fails to impress."

      "text": "The Joker is an entertaining movie and its depiction of the titular character was compelling from begging to end.  Joaquin Phoenix's performance was outstanding and will be remembered as on of the better Joker performances. Unfortunately, the movie falls flat when it comes to its themes and what it wants to say.It seems like it wants us to be on the side of the working class. After all, the joker is a working class man who's issues are exacerbated by the upperclass. The government cut funding to mental health services, leaving him without his therapist and medication. Thomas Wayne seems uncaring and critical of the poor and even his celebrity hero made jokes at his expense.  Following the Joker's actions, you can see how the class divide came to a head with the working class finally having enough of the oppression of the upper class and want social change.However, this falls apart when you consider the actions of the Joker and rioters. The Joker, while more sympathetic in this iteration, is still a psychopathic killer and he is propped up as the hero of the working class. The working class started rioting and one even murders the Waynes in the alley as a form of revenge on the upper class. If the film wants us to take the side of the working class as the ones being taken advantage of, it failed.  The upperclass were **** but the working class are dangerous criminals. This isn't helped by the fact that the movie showed the murder of the Waynes. We all know what will become of young Bruce. He becomes the hero of Gotham.  He is also the top 1% Billionaire playboy. So eventually the hero of Gotham will be a rich man saving Gotham from people like his parent's murderer, who happens to be a poor and angry at the rich.Even if the movie wanted to try to take a 'both sides' argument, it fails because the  actions of the working class were way worse than the actions of the upperclass.  The upperclass are the ones getting murdered in the streets. The working class are the ones idolising a killer clown. It seems very one sided."

Lots of slow mo wide shots pan the film tine to reach over the 2 hour mark. Its action is intense which is brilliant. Watch it"

Almost like they knew it was a gamble and green-lit total creative freedom.  Fantastic!  The soundtrack, both original and licensed, the setting, the pacing, the scene composition, the dialog and the story were all excellent.  I'm not sure the actor was the best fit for Joker, but he did a great job regardless.  He hit the somber lows really well, and the lows were necessary fuel for the Joker's highs that he performed satisfactorily.  There was still slight room for improvement, but not enough to push it out of the 10/10 slot: the movie could have ended 5 minutes earlier and been more subtle in a few places, almost like the director is asking \"Did you get it?  Let me explain it for some of you\", but overall, this goes well beyond expectations for a comic book movie.Now give Watchmen the same treatment!"
