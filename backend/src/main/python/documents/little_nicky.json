Although not as funny as some of Sandler's early work i.e. 'Happy Gilmore' and/or 'Billy Madison' this film is still light years ahead of some of Adam's more recent movies like 'Jack and Jill'. Whats more is that you don't even have to be a true metalhead to \"get\" some of the references but it is much more appreciated if you are a fan of the genre. Supporting cast are so-so."
