Some have terrible dialogue, are badly produced, but are still entertaining to watch. Others fulffill other combinations of these criteria, not this one, though.It's not an overstatement to say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever gone through the peril of watching. It's not even 2 hours long, yet still felt like an eternity. You can see that it's absolutely cheaply produced, which can be charming sometimes, but just seeing a bunch of people slaughtering faceless, mindless zombies while royaltyfree_shotgun.wav is being played in the background is just not good.I hate this movie, don't watch it, it's a waste of time. Please watch World War Z, Jeruzalem or maybe go outside for once.
