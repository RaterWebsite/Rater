The way Pixar addressed the narrative on the concept of one\u2019s soul and the meaning of life was both beautiful and interesting. Soul is a funny and heartwarming film and I highly recommend it."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "*Closer to a 6.8/10.Visually perfect and thematically interesting but lacking that final polish. The notable lack of sound design gives the movie an awkward feel, understandable since it probably had to be done in quarantine but a problem none the less. There is also a lot I feel hurts the overall narrative of the film, most notably a scene early on that calls into question the ticking clock element of the story.A lot of fun none the less and I expect that I will get more out of it upon a rewatch."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This is a really great Pixar movie. I just wanna start off with that. It has breathtaking visuals, amazing music, and a great cast. Richard Ayoade keeps on being one of the best actors no one seems to recognize. The visual ideas are really inventive and interesting, \"The zone\" being one of the most creative things I have seen in a film. The montage towards the end of the film made me cry, and is peak Pixar. Pretty much every scene spent in the spirit realm is really great. The scenes on earth is more of a problem. They have a bit of a whiplash effect, after the creativity on display in the spirit realm. Another problem is the weird, essentially tangential part where the protagonist is turned into a cat. I really appreciate that 22 got to be a human, but couldn't she just discover the wonders of the world as a cat? Anyway, I really liked this movie, despite its mistakes. It isn't very funny, which is a bit of a sad trend with modern Pixar, but it is still pretty great. It reminds me of the glory days of pixar, of Ratatouille and Wall-e and Up. I really hope this might usher in other films like that. And also that they stop making movies like Onward."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The movie is basically inside out but a little bit more mature, with an even more interesting concept, better looking animation and some very relatable characters, Pixar is really back after this movie, and I can't wait to see what other ideas they have in the works."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "A film full of emotion and heart.

Even if it might be seen as a work that follows the path already took by inside out in 2015 it works very well.

Music is the best part, the animation amazing as always, but the story... well, it is great but could be better."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "This movie captivated me quickly, but then left me a bit confused at parts. Not because anything was too ambitious or deep, it was more how disjointed the story seemed to be between the living world and spirit world. I don't want to ruin anything but there are things that happen that flat out made zero sense and had my head scratching, especially in the last quarter of the movie. Also when the cat thing happened I was kinda like....I guess that has to be for the children because that route made way less sense to me than a fusion situation, where they were BOTH operating. It's one of those you have to just accept it's a fictional movie kind of deals.I really enjoyed most of the characters a lot. Terry was my biggest gripe character-wise. I get you aren't supposed to like him and he's arguably the only antagonist if there is one, but he was just a means to an end obviously. I just felt like there was a struggle to connect the two realms to further the story in the writers room. There was a lot of hurrying things along near the end.Overall a good movie that conveys a message about how our desire to seek purpose (and how those purposes can become obsessions) can take away from really \"living\" life. Just missed the mark a bit in the writers room."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Didactical, strong and beautifully animated; Soul is one of the best movies Pixar has ever made."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "'Soul' is a dazzling movie.

As an overall movie it's pretty good with deep meaning of life searching subject matter. Problem is it's pixar so if you sit the kids down expecting Frozen or the like they're going to be bored out of their minds. This is drama with a capital D so maybe watch it before you think younger kids will enjoy it. Mine didn't. Not from a lack of quality but simply because it's just not a kids movie.Given that I have to wonder why they would even put it in pixar's hands instead of just making it live action. The subject matter is majorly adult but the visuals are very kids movie. I didn't hate it but was very dissatisfied when I was looking for a family movie that made everyone happy."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Really disappointed after such great reviews. There is a fantastic idea at the heart of this movie but it isn\u2019t fully realised in a satisfactory way. Emotionally disjointed and seemingly confused by it\u2019s own existential rules, it misses the opportunity to match the ghosts of Pixar\u2019s past. If the present critics say it does, then I fear for what is yet to come."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Disney and Pixar have struck gold with this animated feature about a struggling musician that finds the secret of life through a literal out-of-body experience. When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I wasn't blown away but after watching it I must say it is not at all what I expected but that is a good thing. Soul is a film that does a lot of things right. It's main character is interesting and gets a decent amount of character development that helps audiences connect with him. The animation is stunning, the supporting cast is superb and the story is deeper than I could have imagined. I love stories that have a purpose and leave its viewers with a lasting effect long after the credits roll and this film certainly accomplishes that. Soul might not be a kids film but it is one of the best animated films of the year by a long shot."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Amazing movie.

Cast is great, too."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Some people have told me: ''Pixar never disappoints''.And I don't know about them, but for me they have, but Pixar has also produced superb classics in animation.Fortunately Soul will fall into that category.Soul takes a similar approach to what the studio did on Inside Out, but let's say that here it takes you to the origin source.Everything is a metaphor of course, but the intuitive and captivating is what elevates this story.It could hardly be classified as a kid's film, because although they will be able to enjoy it of course, what makes this film special can only be appreciated by a more mature audience.A huge pity the film didn't get a theater release, because I would've loved to have seen it on the big screen, but that's water under the bridge, the film has been released worldwide now, and it's a wonderful adventure that I can recommend to everyone."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This is a really good movie! The art design and  the animation style are very nice to look at and keep your eyes engaged. The storyline is very thought provoking and the writing is top notch.

All around great movie and I highly recommend watching it!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "An amazing Pixar movie for these hard times. Thoroughly enjoyed the whole movie.

Da un gran mensaje y nos hace replantearnos muchas cosas de la vida. Los personajes son muy carism\u00e1ticos y la animaci\u00f3n es de lo mejor que he visto, pero si hablo de las cosas que no me gustaron, siento que la pel\u00edcula rompe con la seriedad que transmite en algunas situaciones de comedia como cuando Joe se convierte en el gato, se siente como la parte mas d\u00e9bil de la pel\u00edcula. Una pel\u00edcula animada que toca tantos temas complejos y serios necesita equilibrar mucho mas su comedia y que se note menos forzada. Y despu\u00e9s esta el tema de que siento que no explotan el mundo de fantas\u00eda que propone. Se menciona el gran despues, el infierno y el gran antes, pero creo que le falto un poquito mas de desarrollo. En su lugar, la pel\u00edcula trata de explorar mas la vida de Joe.En mi opini\u00f3n, no es una de las mejores pel\u00edculas animadas que he visto de todos los tiempos, pero definitivamente es una de las mejores que he visto en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os.

A masterpiece in every sense of the word."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Initial Thoughts:\u201cSoul\u201d is one of the must see films of the year. Why? Because it has a well thought out plot that is thought provoking, and at moments in time, emotionally heartening. This film is all it claims to be and more by not just skimming the surface of what most of us think in our day-to-day lives. It reaches much further into our souls. It had me thinking who I would like to be and what I could be. Although I didn\u2019t find the answer in 2-hours it had me wondering, what is THE spark that makes me, me?Visually, this film is spectacular. At times I would forget that it was an animated film, but this aspect had me more invested into the incredible story. I think each individual who watches this film will have a different take and level of emotional response. Speaking for myself. At the end of the day I didn\u2019t feel the emotional heartstrings being tugged at, but I honestly felt like my soul had been moved to want more and to be better.The last takeaway to this film is head up. Take each day for what it is and live it to your fullest because you may never get the opportunity for a do over or second chance. Be kind to yourself and those around you, as it may trodden them in such a way that they lose hope or faith in who they are and who they are meant to be.Overall:Honestly, this is a must see film before the year is up. It\u2019s visually stunning, thought provoking, and emotionally driven. Admittedly, I did have my doubts and thought this film would fall short of my expectations, which was 10/10, but instead it met them, which was a 10/10.Enjoy the show!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "A very heart warming movie, which constantly reminds you of that life is a blessing, even when it doesn't go as we planned.

Of course, it's visually amazing, but its storytelling couldn't aim any higher. It's about New York, the Black American experience, jazz, teaching -- and the meaning of existence. And unlike practically any other movie about jazz, the music is first-rate. (John Baptiste, Questlove, and Herbie Hancock were among the performers and consultants.)

The \"uncanny valley\" problem is huge, it pulls you out of the movie, over and over again. It really is a live-action & animated movie. It isn't \"The Incredibles\" where the character's powers and stylization make sense. They tried to make it for all audiences and in the end, it isn't made for anyone. It is not for little kids because the theme is adult philosophical ideas and it is not for adults because the pacing and visuals are for kids.
