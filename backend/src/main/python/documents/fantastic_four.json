I've learned that a FF film was in \"development hell\" for some decades, so when it finally came out, obviously I rushed to the theater. And, I was not disappointed at all. Of course it's not as good as X-Men 2 or Spider-Man (the original, with Tobey Maguire), but it's good for what it aims to be: a sci-fi/action movie about comic book characters. You have to understand that the Fantastic Four are not as popular as other heroes, like Iron Man i.e., besides, their stories always covered the most strange, bizarre, far out things imaginable. And, because they are a family, there are many corny moments in the movie, but the comics too have those moments, then you just have to \"let it go\", to really enjoy the story. Overall, it's a very decent movie about very decent people. Relax, and enjoy the ride!"

I do like the cast to the heroes and villain. The action scenes are pretty good, but the sad part is that there was only 2 scenes. Also, this whole movie does is always make pointless catch phrases so it would sound funny. They didn't have to make the whole movie humorous. I was surprised to the performance of Julian McMahon as Dr. Victor von Doom, he was better than I thought. But the thing I really disliked about this movie was the annoyance of Human Torch and complaining of The Thing. The Thing always **** and complained through out the whole friggin' film, I wanted Mr. Fantastic to use his elastic body to cover Things mouth. There was a few flaws with this film, but I still enjoy watching it. It's just not a great superhero alliance film, like X-Men, Watchmen, Kick-Ass, and The Avengers."

Take the Raimi Spider-Man , which I think best represent how it should be done a cinecomic , in those films there's always been a dramatic side and a funny side , but neither of them prevailed over the other, Raimi was able to keep them in perfect balance , making it believable ( as a film about a man spider to be credible ) most of the events !\rIn \" Fantastic 4 \" this balance there is absolutely , in fact, the film tends to give more benefit to the side comic caring about the psychology of the characters and their state of mind after having acquired powers . The consequence is a characterization of the characters to the limits of trivial !\rAnother weak point is the villain , anonymous and absolutely no bite , really badly written !\rOn the plus side we definitely special effects incredible , absolutely not at the level of the film, and the music , which surely would have had even more impact if the film had been conceived differently!\rIf you want to see a cinecomic studied well and with great directing and screenwriting , stay completely away from this mess !"

Once the group gets there powers nothing happens. Little action, no crime fighting just characters sitting around and doing nothing until the last 10/15 where the audience witnesses a decent fight with a poor quality Doom. With the way comicbook movies have evolved over the years this film becomes even more of a joke/cheesefest as time goes on. Thankfully, the sequel, which this film surprisingly got, picked up the pace a bit and regardless of its problems was better and somewhat resembled what a Fantastic Four movie should be.

Alba may not be a perfect visual depiction of Sue Storm, but I thought she did OK.\r My main gripe with this movie is the writing.OMG, could they messed Dr Doom up any more! Granted, McMahon is doing his best with what he's been given, it still isn't enough to hide the butchering his character underwent in the writers script. For shame Mark Frost and Michael France!\r Plot is also incredibly underwhelming. Granted, it does work very well as a F4 origin story, a shame it didn't do much else.\r Overall:\rFantastic 4 is a decent, but flat, origin story.

      "text": "Fantastic Four: 4 out of 10 Some comic book heroes don't translate well to film. Daredevil was a case in point. While a blind guy wearing a cherry red leather outfit might work on the panels of a comic book it looks silly on screen. (Not that this excuses the horrible Daredevil movie mind you) Mr. Fantastic (The stretching guy) of the Fantastic Four suffers this same fate. When he stretches it looks either disgusting (hand squeezing under the crack beneath a door) or quite silly (every other time he stretches.) Not that the character is helped by Ioan Gruffud's somnolent performance. He makes up one third of the most sleep inducing love triangle ever filmed.\r The lady in question is the Jessica Alba who looks fantastic in and out of her costume (She turns invisible when naked sorry guys. But some dutiful frame by frame DVD action will surprise the patient) but she expresses no emotion about either man (Or for that matter having superpowers. But I guess looking like Jessica Alba is kind of a superpower in itself). The third part is our pseudo villain Dr. Doom. (I say pseudo because he turns villain sometime around the closing credits in the most truncated villain performance in the history of superhero films) Dr. Doom as written for the comics is the perfect screen super villain. Which begs the question why he is barely in this movie and more importantly why he is a metrosexual evil businessman (Forced to be evil because his IPO went down in price and the bank is pulling out? Which shows a remarkable lack of knowledge how IPO's work) When Alba tells Gruffud she never slept with Doom we have to believe her. I have a hard time believing these saccharine characters go the bathroom let alone have sex.\r The other two members of the four (Evans and Chiklis) give competent if one note performances. But by the time all the introductions and back-story is completed the movie is over. With no villain, unimaginative action set pieces and some shaky special effects Fantastic Four is more mediocre than fantastic. Though there is that one frame of a not quite invisible Alba that is Fantastic indeed."
