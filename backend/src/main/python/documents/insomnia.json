Al Pacino plays the gruff and seasoned detective sent to the mountainous regions of Alaska to investigate the murder of a young teen girl, but we immediately begin to understand the life of Pacinos character, Will Dormer. He knows the ins and outs of how to study a crime scene, looking for the little details, but he also seems exhausted, soaking up life through routine as a man who has seen it all, tired, possibly bored but still able to show up the young blood at any given turn. His younger partner Eckhart (Martin Donovan) respects the decisions of his superior, but he also has the opportunity to give evidence against his older counterpart to Internal Affairs, but their motive in the film is to help out with the murder, where Dormor finds a fan on young and motivated cop Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), hangs onto every word of the ageing detective. But we he an unexpected and thrilling introduction to the person responsible for the crime, ***SPOILERS*** Dormor and his men stakeout a clue and tragedy strikes when Dormor shoots and kills his partner, this was an accident, right? Dormor is overcome with guilt to the point where he cannot admit his mistake, but one person knows what he did, that person is the man responsible for the young girls death. Robin Williams plays the calm and sophisticated writer, who tells Dormor that it was all an accident, we now have a cat and mouse game, the scenes Pacino and Williams share are excellent, two fine actors, Williams in particular, who proves his talent yet again for dramatic roles, but this style of storytelling is truly fascinating because of its revelations halfway through the film, which are brought down by simplistic and routine Hollywood chase sequences and silly throw-ins to give that blockbuster touch, which are unnecessary, especially when the thrill of the chase, all through dialogue and performances, is already so interesting. Pacino is excellent as the now sleep-deprived cop, who can't even rest away from the world, while Williams plays a cunning adversary who has it all worked out, as he keeps telling us, but its rough justice which wins out, Nolan sets it in remote parts to capture the essence of being alone with your thoughts, while still not escaping the ramifications of something that makes you run away."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Christopher Nolan's Insomnia is a riveting psychological thriller that is immaculately cast, mysterious and thrilling.

First off, Al Pacino and Robin Williams are phenomenal. I love comedians doing roles that are completely against their type and boy oh boy did Williams do that here. He was phenomenal, creepy and unsettling all wrapped into one and he nails the role. Director Christopher Nolan shows incredible talent here as he manages to creepy a truly unsettling atmosphere that never scares you to be sure, but certainly keeps you on edge. The script is very good and the characters are very well done, to the point that you are never truly sure who is good and who is truly bad. Overall, Insomnia is a good, but not great thriller that is not Nolan's best work, but that certainly does not mean it is ever bad."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Even though Nolan has several good approaches, Insomnia is nothing more than generic, unspectacular, and forgettable in the long run. Hillary Seitz\u2019s adapted screenplay is laden with crime show stereotypes and gratuitous dialogue but lacks real character development or any unique elements. The best example for this is Hilary Swank who obviously has the most unfavourable role as an aspiring assistant detective that wants nothing more than to get advise from the old-established cop. Due to all of that, remarkable achievements in terms of visuals can\u2019t help the film anymore than Pacino\u2019s dedicated acting and Insomnia is best watched on a weekday evening while eating lunch and conversing with your partner."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Good director, great actors, a story with some twists and a lot of moral dilemmas.

I greatly enjoyed the five short extras on my DVD (a double-sided disc I bought years ago that has 'The Devil's Advocate' on the other side, yet unwatched): a conversation/interview of Nolan with Pacino; 'Day for Night: The Making of...'; 'In the Fog' (which interviewed cinematographer Wally Pfister); Nathan Crowley: production designer; and 'Eyes Wide Open' (which interviewed sleep disturbance experts), which thankfully I viewed before I watched the movie, to enhance my experience.\r Greatly recommended to fans of contemporary crime thrillers, regardless of whether you watched the Norwegian original or not.

It's hard explaining how i felt on Insomnia,since this isn't your typical Nolan movie with magnificent storytelling (like Memento or Following) and instead it acts like your typical mystery/crime movie,even though at some point,i could've seen where Nolan was trying to make a thing of its own,with some great cinematography,and probably some memorable lines too. Keep in mind that they were trying to remake a classic European movie of the '70,and i know you shoudn't mess while remaking a classic movie (like most 'modern' remakes),but,even if the story wasn't Nolan at its best,i still enjoyed it. It's one of those rare movies that keeps an eye on every plot and subplot without forgetting anything,like Dormer (played by Al Pacino) having accidentally killed his partner,or the case of this girl being murdered by someone. It's because of the creepy imagery that Nolan's trying to set up during some moments of Dormer having some troubling moments in some scenes (As the movie goes). I was lucky the movie didn't feel choppy,since from minute one to the 40/45-minute mark,the editing made the movie feel like it was going 'Fast' a-la LEGO Movie. The acting,as always,was superb,but Robin Williams felt bored as the movie was coming to the end. In the end,the story not being Nolan at its best may be the reason on why Insomnia may be the most underrated Nolan movie,but other than that,it still has some powerful cinematography,some superb acting,and impressive sound effects."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I had some expectations when I saw this movie. Its almost impossible not to create them, when we have before us a film by the prestigious Christopher Nolan, with actors as strong as Al Pacino, Hillary Swank and Robin Williams (the latter - rare case - in a role of dramatic villain). Only later did I come to discover that this was a remake of another Norwegian film, which I never saw.The script is based on a police investigation into a crime in Alaska, where the Sun has the peculiarity of, at the peak of Summer, never to disappear from the horizon. Will Dormer, a Los Angeles cop, goes there, but he's not used to the environment or the white nights, so he cannot sleep. Something that worsens as the remorse for his past haunts the investigation.Nolan is a skilled director with unquestionable ability. However, this movie is far from his best. In fact, if we didn't know that he was in, this movie could perfectly well be any other good American director. But there are moments of brilliance: the way insomnia was portrayed, the way the white Alaskan landscape was used to make the place oppressive, mysterious and inhospitable... The script, in turn (in one of the rare films where Nolan avoided getting involved in writing), has more of a turnaround and can get our attention. Although we know very early on who is the criminal and the great villain, the film focuses on the figure of the policeman, calling into question his way of doing justice, avoiding making him a hero, just as he avoids making the victim an innocent figure. The murdered young woman, in fact, was not a choir girl.Al Pacino was perfectly up to the challenge and along with Williams dominates the entire film. This duo of striking actors is fundamental and was able to do what it took to make their characters strong and domineering. Right behind, we can appreciate Hilary Swank, an actress whose performances have not always appealed to me in other films, but who was very well here."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Perhaps my favorite Alaskan movie.

Even in the most early stages of his career, it's easy to see his genius, that's why so many big stars wanted to work with him right away. Insomnia is the least well known of all his films and does lack some of the things that have become Nolan's trademark, but it's still a terrific film. The story follows two L.A. Detectives sent to a remote part of Alaska, where the sun doesn't set for six months and then doesn't rise for six months. They're there to solve a brutal and calculated murder, but circumstances lead them down a different path. Despite being one of the best Hollywood has to offer, I haven't really been much of a Pacino fan. To me, it seemed as though he had lost something with age, his performance in Insomnia proved me wrong. Terrific is not the word for what Al Pacino was and he's not the only genius Nolan surrounded himself with. This film is incredibly well written and being the perfectionist that he is, Nolan got only the best people to star in it. It's not the kind of Nolan film, we've been spoiled with over the past 10 years, but Insomnia is a great story, with an unbelievable cast and in my opinion is a must see."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Directed by Nolan and starring Al Pacino, Insomnia is nothing short of a thrilling masterpiece.

The big twist in Christopher Nolan's astonishing Memento\u2013a thriller that unfolds in reverse chronological order\u2013is that the gimmick suddenly melts away, revealing a deeply considered and profound statement about the slippery nature of memory and the human capacity for self-deception. So it only follows that Nolan's next project, a compelling big-budget remake of the superb Norwegian \"sunlit noir\" Insomnia, would segue smoothly (and in reverse anatomical order, no less) from memory to perception, relishing the sometimes fuzzy connection between the eyes and the mind. Those who aren't familiar with Erik Skjoldbj\u00e6rg's original will likely be immune to the remake's biggest flaw, which is the disappointing suspicion that Nolan, for all his talent and craft, never came up with a reason for the remake, other than to translate a great film into English and introduce it to a wider audience. But while his additions and subtractions are negligible, the premise still carries an ingenious metaphorical hook, centering on a man whose guilty conscience can never escape the light of day. In a role originally played by the much younger Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Al Pacino looks haggard; his world-weary demeanor speaks volumes about his character, a veteran L.A. detective assigned to investigate the murder of a high-school student in small-town Alaska. As an internal-affairs unit prepares to mount a corruption case against him back home, Pacino and partner Martin Donovan track a methodical killer during summer in the Arctic Circle, under perpetual sunlight. A ruse to snare the suspect pays off, but a shootout on a foggy beach ends with Pacino accidentally shooting Donovan and then hastily covering it up, worried that his partner's cooperation in the internal-affairs case will make him the obvious culprit. While a local officer (Hilary Swank) collects evidence for a report on the incident, the sole witness (Robin Williams, in his best performance in about 18 years) blackmails Pacino to save his own hide. As Pacino endures day after day without a wink of sleep, Insomnia skillfully turns the screws, delving further into his troubled mind as it's haunted by past and present sins, as well as deceptive visions that seem to bleed out of his conscience. Nolan's solid, workmanlike direction doesn't strike any memorable grace notes, but he draws out the key ambiguities in the story with great precision, to the point where even Pacino himself isn't certain whether the shooting was an accident. Long on atmospherics and short on plot, the original Insomnia drifts so far away from the initial murder investigation that it nearly becomes incidental to the real story, about a crooked man deprived of the darkness he needs to conceal his secrets. Nolan reverses the emphasis\u2013;no surprise from the director of a plot-driven film like Memento\u2013but achieves the same end, bringing Hollywood noir under the harsh glare of permanent daylight."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "A good drama based on a murder. Although  the plot was weak as at times it felt more like an inner conflict than an a external one. However the highlights of the film was Al Pachino performance and the amazing camera shots that straighten the film."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I'd lean towards the supporting characters that aren't just filling in for the leads, they have got some gunpowder in their pocket.InsomniaNolan tases you with a sassy outlook on a crime thriller that flips the priorities and expectations of the viewers. But hold onto your hats, for unlike the textbook Nolan phenomenon, we are in awe with the journey rather than the big reveal of the film. In the sense that it is more fascinating to see who is what then who-dun-it case. And on that note the plot takes a major turn on making the detective a criminal. And it is not until in later stage you find that road taken by him, when you see Will Dormer played by Al Pacino panting and worried sick about getting caught from the police of his very own department. Will, a hardcore successful detective, finds himself on a new case that haunts him back to his own self.The only feature, as of now, to mark in Nolan's filmography where he contributes only as a director and not a writer. Although it is said that he did write a rough draft of the screenplay. And I was really excited to see him pull off someone else's material and quite early in the film I was assured that this heavy yet sensitive responsibility couldn't have gotten a better caretaker. And it is that fog crime scene in its first act that shows you, how precise Nolan is on projecting himself exquisitely to what is told in the paper.You cannot not mention the interrogation scene between Robin Williams and Al Pacino when talking about this film. And yes, I get that it has much more juicy whistleblowing information revealed where the entire film hinges upon. But it is also a testament on how to \"look\" in an act. How to gaze at each other, Pacino, and not gaze at each other, Williams, and play cards with higher stakes. P.S. it is a joy to watch Pacino evolve into a person suffering from Insomnia step by step, frame by frame, just with the way he handles his eyes and how they hung low with his brow as the film ages on screen."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "It didn't match with the poster or the trailer. When I first saw this film on the screen, I was very confused. Now, I love this film. It's true that it's the film that we can not see Christopher Nolan's talent in the film. However, I guarantee that this film will make you actually feel that you have insomnia. I loved the acting in all ways. I loved characters in every ways."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Christopher Nolan\u2019s 2002 crime thriller is, in my opinion, often overlooked by his fans and general audiences alike. I feel like perhaps they tend to have just come off the back of Inception, or The Dark Knight, and are surprised to see a film of such small scale coming from a director renowned for his high grossing blockbusters, but what they forget is that before Nolan was trying to become the next Kubrick (exaggeration I know), his films were much less high octane and in a sense far more indie, which is a style that to an extent I prefer. I was initially disappointed with insomnia\u2019s slow pacing and narrative simplicity, but upon rewatching it I found my views on the film had drastically changed. The story takes place in Nightmute, Alaska, where a well respected detective (Al Pacino) and his partner are called over to investigate the murder of a 17 year old girl. On one hand, he faces scrutiny fromInternal investigations for his morally ambiguous decisions in the past, a situation which is only made more intense by the accidental killing of his own partner. On the other he has to deal with Robin Williams\u2019s Walter Finch, the murderer himself who seems only intent on playing mind games with Pacino. Finally to make matters worse, due to the story taking place in Alaska during the summer, meaning that during the night the sun stays out preventing him from getting any sleep, hence the name 'Insomnia'. It\u2019s hard to pin down what exactly makes this movie so great in my eyes. For one, I absolutely adore how the atmosphere gradually increases in intensity as the plot begins to thicken. Pacino\u2019s flawless performance (which may be my favorite of his) perfectly conveys his stress and fatigue, which is made all the more real by kinetic editing, that frequently cuts to brief flashbacks and hallucinations in order to catch the viewer off guard.On the other hand the absolutely stunning scenery and beautiful score by David Julyan acts as a welcomed contrast to the otherwise overwhelming tension. As much as I love Hans Zimmer I do sometimes miss when Julyan scored Nolan\u2019s movies. Robin Williams is also as always phenomenal, giving a performance so chilling it made me feel physically uncomfortable, similar to (although not quite as extreme as) his other 2002 thriller 'One Hour Photo'. Other than the aforementioned qualities, one of my favorite things about the film is that underneath the fact that it\u2019s another suspenseful crime thriller (which I am a sucker for), insomnia is a dark, ponderous inquiry into morality of pragmatic \"dirty cops\" who bend the rules for the greater good. Pacino\u2019s character is far from innocent, but at the end of the day does the end justify the means? Are his past illegal actions excused by the all good that comes from them?At the beginning he is more or less comfortable with the reality that he has all this time been doing the right thing, but this idea is called into question the young and inquisitive Ellie Burr, who is played by Hillary Swank adding yet another stellar performance on top of both Pacino and Williams. In the end I could go on and on about why this movie is underrated, and why I believe it is one of Nolan\u2019s best films, but for the sake of brevity I\u2019ll leave it here. Ultimately Insomnia is a fantastic psychological thriller that has a lot more to it than meets the eye. It\u2019s high levels of stress and themes of moral ambiguity are perfectly executed due to the stellar cast, fantastic editing and gorgeous contrasting cinematography and music."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Even before Christopher Nolan started directing the Batman trilogy, he managed to serve us a film called Insomnia. His previous films were pretty psycho so I was expecting something like that here, but I wasn't quite there. I can't say I was disappointed though. The film is not as mysterious as the previous ones, but the plot is cool. From one particular action moment onwards, I was just waiting to see how the film would end, and in the end I was satisfied. On top of that, the casting of the main character is impeccable in the form of Al Pacino, who this time has put his hands away from criminal activities like The Godfather or Scarface and follows the footsteps of a detective investigating the disappearance of a young girl.
