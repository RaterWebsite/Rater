Bruce Willis is great in it, and while the plot is fairly predictable, it's what I like to refer to as \"predictable, in a good way.\" Had it tried to throw me for a loop just for the sake of having a zany plot twist, I would've probably hated it.

Although not as good as suspenseful or artful as Blade Runner (Harrison Ford), it has it's own sense of portraying what a future with robots could be like. The chase scenes were a little over the top using some computer game physics more than real life physics, they were entertaining and fun to watch. The perfect people used to act as robots were generally well done and robotic enough to be believable as non human. I especially liked the wife. Her robot was perfectly beautiful, but hid a woman with very serious personal problems (trying not to put a spoiler here). The desire for connection by Bruce to reconnect with the woman that he loves was beautifully done. I really felt like he missed the humanity that used to be in the world. All in all a good movie with a good plot."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The right ending has a doppleganger, the happy ending, an unaware essence of story that puts everything in blissful order against the film's narrative organicity. Savvy moviegoers with a sixth sense(the right ending usually dies after a slew of rewrites and focus group scrutinization) can ferret out the right ending beneath the filmic posterity, which is why most major studio movies are often so unsatisfying. \"Surrogates\", a dystopian sci-fi'er starring Bruce Willis and his Euro-trash robot, cheats, big time, because it forges an unfounded wrinkle in the diegetic guideline that holds dominion over the film's narrative. The expediency behind the resolvability of conflict this time goes beyond formula and commercial considerations; this time, the happy ending renders everything which preceeded its self-correcting point in time, as nonsensical. The weapon used against the surrogates, established at the outset as being capable of liquefying skulls while users sit in their sim-chairs, no longer has that same killing wherewithal when it matters most. The eye-popping visual, as seen in the trailer(reminiscent of M. Night Shyamalan's \"The Happening\") is how \"Surrogates\" should end. During the climax, Willis' positioning of imminent heroism recalls the film-within-the-film in Robert Altman's \"The Player\", where he delivers the immortal line, \"Traffic was a bitch,\" to a death row inmate(played by Julia Roberts), who he had just saved from a lethal injection in the nick of time. (***SPOILER ALERT***) This time, Willis lets the hairy situation with cataclysmic implications run its due course without interference, which at the time seemed antithetical to his action star persona. At the last second, we think, Tom Greer agreed with Canter(James Cromwell). But as it turns out, the FBI agent was basing his decision on an assumption about the weapon's effects on people that the filmmaker never bothers to set up. Thanks to the customary eradication of the right ending by its doppleganger, Willis still gets to be the hero, albeit through the film's utter contempt for the concept of continuity."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Not a bad movie...interesting topic and the acting was pretty good.

Nope.

The college student was a fair target, considering who they were aiming for. However, this becomes a side issue among the division between the predictability and the actual exploration of humanity's frightening procrastination at becoming old and unable to go through life. This was in contrast with turning it into some kind of fashion statement, as if artificiality and beauty can prolong meaning of life itself. Bruce Willis is ultimately superb in this role, considerably cynical and not sarcastic, distinctive in a world of people who are plugged into androids. In turn, there are obvious cliches that you would find in an action sci-fi, albeit having action that was just as necessary as the dialogue."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Surrogates (2009): Potentially good movie with a great premise ruined by a cheesy, shallow and awkward script.

In the beginning, the ultimate bad guy is described as having been booted out of the corporation he himself founded.  You know, the corporation where they build all the surrogates.  So you could understand the guy being vengeful.  But by the end of the film the dialog is trying to convince us that this same guy is a psycho.  Never mind that he's got motive.  He just CRAZZEEEE!!!  And when the guy himself spends an inevitable moment explaining himself, he doesn't even mention getting booted out of his own corporation, where they make all the surrogates.  Suddenly, it's like he's got some weirdo religion.  Instead of wanting vengeance against the people who booted him out, he thinks surrogates are evil and should be destroyed.\r Wow.

The idea behind it is quite 'out there' although not new. Bruce Willis has appeared in other sci-fi movies in the past including The Fifth Element, although he's more well known for his roles in purely action or action drama movies such as Die Hard. Also featured in the cast is Radha Mitchell (who appeared in Pitch Black, Man on Fire (a brilliant movie!) and Finding Neverland) and Rosamund Pike (Made in Dagenham, Johnny English Reborn etc.).This movie features plenty of action as well as the sci-fi aspects though, there is a good amount of visual effects which seem quite realistic and up to date, indeed the movie is pretty recent, from 2009. The plot is a bit quirky but it plays out quite well, the action scenes with fights, shooting, chases and the visual effects used to give these a bit more oomph, as it were. There's a decent cast and I felt it kept my attention throughout - the story itself is a bit confusing in parts but it doesn't matter too much, its easy enough to follow the general idea and its quite entertaining in general - it doesn't appear as if the cast are bored or just sleepwalking their way through the film, its quite 'animated' as it were, you could say it has a bit of a comic book feel to it, especially when I think of the few scenes showing the robotic skeletons as it were of some of the surrogates that are revealed at times.This is a lively action sci-fi movie which is perhaps a bit zany for some but I felt that it was overall quite good fun - there isn't much in the way to offend people, there's a bit of violence but nothing too graphic, the visual effects making it have more of a comic book type feel to it. This movie has a rating of 12a, so its fine to show to teenagers but might potentially upset younger viewers. There is also some bad language and one or two scenes of whats categorised as sexuality, although again its nothing particularly graphic, its more funny if you've seen it and know what I mean (sexy robots - I'm guessing men wrote the script for this? lol). There is more of a serious question posed by the movie I suppose but then thats good for movies to have two sides to them, I think and its good that its entertaining and not overly preachy, while I felt it did make me think about the questions posed behind it somewhat. The cast all come across pretty enthusiastic and it doesn't drag on too much, compared to some more modern sci-fi movies such as Artifical Intelligence which is a slower movie that lasts over two hours I believe, this movie only just lasts an hour and a half - any longer and it might well have landed in the getting a bit tedious and too strung out category, which is a killer when it comes to such sci-fi movies to me anyway (though thats a personal preference/thing, of course).This isn't a movie I'd heard of prior to seeing it listed on my TVs EPG as it was shown on TV recently, I presume it wasn't overly successful but I'm glad I recorded it - it certainly wasn't what I'd expected it to be about (expecting a movie about women carrying other couples human babies LOL) but having said that, I think its actually one of the better modern sci-fi action movies - I do tend to prefer sci-fi movies set on earth and this is, obviously, one of those. It looked like it was a rather fun movie to shoot and the cast are fairly enthusiastic, it comes across well and doesn't drag on much as I say, so this impressed me.Yes, im happy to recommend this movie. The plot gets a little bit complicated in one or two points but its fairly easy to follow the main gist of it and the action scenes are quite entertaining - it isn't entirely bogged down in complicated background information like some sci-fi movies can be, its both entertaining and it carries relevant questions which we should probably all consider about our reliance on technology these days to live our lives and how more isolated our lives may be becoming, as we sit indoors using technology to communicate and achieve things (such as me sitting at home typing up this review to post online, I suppose). It doesn't come across as too much of a preachy movie, it is a little 'out there' but its also not *as* pretentious as perhaps you might have found similar movies such as The Matrix (which I felt was a bit too much for me, if you know what I mean!), so personally I thought this was pretty good, its a shame its not more well known."}], "recommendations": ["the_tomorrow_war", "riddick", "elysium", "the_last_witch_hunter", "x_men_apocalypse", "jumper", "independence_day_resurgence", "terminator_genisys", "max_steel", "bloodshot", "pacific_rim_uprising", "infinite", "the_book_of_eli", "bright", "what_happened_to_monday", "lucy", "jupiter_ascending", "rampage", "captive_state", "the_purge_election_year", "maze_runner_the_scorch_trials", "i_am_number_four", "i_am_legend", "repo_men", "hercules"]}
