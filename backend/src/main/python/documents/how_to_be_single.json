      "text": "I think we have a big problem with the critique of movies. According to the critics, the most prominent ones are either a load of trash or so generic that we shouldn't give much thought to them. The ones worth praise are low budget and or thematically rich. But this isn't the truth. Every movie has something to give. Most are so good that millions flock to see them. We have a apparent disconnect between those who are paid to review movies and the everyday people who see them. So I think that we shouldn't let the reviewers have the last say as to how well a movie is. I bring this up here because How to be Single is a great example of this. I enjoyed it a good deal. And it should be noted that I have been waiting for this movie ever since they were filming it many months ago. Alison Brie is a awesome actress. And Dakota's also quite cute. And that's all I wanted from this movie.  :)"

      "text": "Those expecting a raunchy comedy revolving around Rebel Wilson may be disappointed to find out that she\u2019s not the central character. She has plenty of opportunity to be outrageous and funny, but there are several other people who fill up the plot. If explores the attempts at hookups and relationship of several people in a somewhat confusing mishmash of romantic lessons. Sure, there are laughs (primarily Wilson), but there are also winning performances and sweet romantic encounters with confused women, sincere (!) guys and one adorable baby. Yes, a total chick flick, but one that\u2019s liable to hit home with its audience."

      "text": "A charming but unmemorable film with a few nice subversions of expectations to help iron out the predictability. Wilson carries the comedy moments, and it's a good take on the buddy movie genre. There's little complexity, as one might expect, and it was fast paced enough to remain interesting, with some attempt at social commentary that was handled competently. A good plane movie. 6.02/10"

      "text": "Like many other female-driven comedies today, HOW TO BE SINGLE aims to be something greater than a simple comedy. It falls flat repeatedly in its attempt to grow deeper than it is. Rebel Wilson's hilarious performance steals the show - that's where they should've focus their efforts. More screen time for Rebel."

      "text": "The young women's attempts to get the life they wanted.\r Another novel based film from the director of 'Love, Rosie'. About the four young women that tells how to enjoy the life by balancing the men and the parties. Very interesting cast, hot ones like Dakota Johnson, Alison Brie and even she's in her 40s Leslie Mann looked so fantastic. The narration had layers to focus on these different people and their different attempt to get the life they wanted. In that, I kind of like Leslie's, maybe the age fact and to be touched by her love tale with decency. But Dakota and Alison led it with their glamorous way and theirs each tale as well not bad, particularly depicting the present world's youngster's culture.\r From the all, the biggest surprise was the Rebel Wilson, who I never liked much as I did for in this, definitely she was at her best. The story was good, seems it was squashed with the too many contents, but awesomely managed to bring them all in one direction by linking them to the main characters. So that makes the stories of everyone take place within the circle and delivered a good entertainment, Lots of fun, even though it is a pure commercial film, there are many things from it that makes us to think seriously. Particularly thinking them from the youngster's perspective about the current world status in the entertainment segment.\r I don't know those who are complaining about it had they watched the same film, Because it is a fine entertainment, even though it is chick film, anybody, particularly adults can have a great time. In a thin margin, there was about men as well, how they're caught between the women they are in love and those women what they believe in. I'm being a man, I really enjoyed it despite target audience is women. I know this is not a masterpiece, but definitely not the worst film of the year or decade. In the film, everyone wanted to be in the relationship, so I did not get it, but the end clarifies decently about the title. Surely worth a watch, if you want a good entertainment.\r 7/10"

      "text": "I really enjoyed this movie. Of course trailer lies a bit - there aren't that many comedic parts and it still is more or less a romantic comedy, meaning if you want more of Rebel Wilson's shenanigans, she isn't doing that much here - even though her moments are the funniest. But I liked the story and liked the idea behind the movie - that it didn't end with main character falling in love with somebody in the end or something but she ended up being single and with a reason behind it - that she wants to do everything she won't have time to do in the future when she won't be single. Not the usual idea that's why I liked it, something fresh"
