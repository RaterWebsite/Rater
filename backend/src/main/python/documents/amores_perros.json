The first time I watched this film  the impression I got from it was not very positive; however, I am happy I watched it again, because I understood if from a totally different perspective, while the first time I did, I was perhaps overly critical. I do recommend the movie! It is intense, endearing, powerful, and at times, brutal...but watching is was  a rewarding experience, just the same!...Amores Perros  definitely had a huge potential to be even more than what it was..."

Es como Pulp Fiction, pero en M\u00e9xico."

Characters go through the path of development through difficult life situations. Probably the most realistic movie about Mexico. And most importantly, a very correct ending. A heavy film for perception, after it there is only a lump in the throat. A cult movie that not many will like."

It captures the three sad stories in such a beautiful, melancholic, aesthetic way For me, all the blood and violence is part of that aestheticness. The movie seems to breathe the town, the atmosphere is conveyed great with, the people, upper class and lower. One of the best movies I've ever seen."

It was sad to see this same filmmaker try to create a similar masterpiece with 21 Grams, and mostly fail. If you didn't like that film, still give this one a chance. It truly is amazing."

      "rating": "7",
      "text": "This film is a serious take on the hyperlink genre, focusing more on social disparity than the titular love: although the three episodes take place in the same city, we see three essentially unrelated stories that could well have been set in three different countries. There are snippets of great cinema, with influences clearly ranging from 50s-60s neorealism to 90's heist films - technically, the film is a great one: camera work, cinematography, writing, editing and soundtrack are all spot on. The only downfall, I found, was the fact that although yes, it is hyperlink, and yes, the episodes are somewhat connected, Amores perros still feels very distinctly trifold.\r Apart from this, the movie is good and is certainly one of the best in its genre. Also, comparisons to Pulp Fiction don't really make sense, since Pulp Fiction was written with a humorous intent, while Amores perros is extremely serious and doesn't ever provide comedy at all."

The best movie of Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, this kind of editing gets a lot of intrigue and tension. The first story was so uncomfortable and tense, the second one was interesting, but nothing more and the last one was the heart of the movie. Everybody did their best in everyway."
