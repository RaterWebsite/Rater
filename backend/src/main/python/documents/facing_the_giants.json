      "text": "Viewing this movie, you are immediately aware of the low budget via the poor lighting, acting, editing, etc. However, I have to give it credit in that it did a good job on a very limited budget. The story itself, while predictable, is fairly entertaining if you set aside the ridiculous plot and reality. One item that stands out for me is when the coach gets a new car and he claims \"God gave me a new car!\" I guess we shouldn't think about the fact that it's a polluting and gas-guzzling V-8. Clearly, the movie is looking to cater to a particular audience. I also have problems with the idea of God really caring about a small town high-school football game outcome - any sporting event for that matter. Also, the overall impression that if you pray hard enough, your dreams will come true. Tell that to parents who have lost a child to cancer, war or an accident. It's religious propaganda. And no, our founding fathers would not be proud, they believed in separation of church and state."

Even though I am a Christian I don't usually like \"Christian\" movies. They tend to be religious and preachy. This movie was NOT! I think anyone, of any religion (or no religion at all) could like this movie. Great football action sequences! Great story! I don't usually cry, but in several places I literally wept for joy! I highly recommend this movie!"

Not only was it one of the best football films I have ever seen, but it also presented a very straight-forward Christian message. This movie had it all- a moving story, great acting, and football. My only complaint is with the MPAA. Why would you give a movie that has no objectionable material a PG rating? If you ask me, this movie needs to be re-rated and given a G. Anyway, pick up this movie as soon as possible. Trust me, you will find it well worth your time and money"

And Facing the Giants is earnest. Whether you agree with the message or not, you can tell that the actors really believe it. Certainly, knowing the story behind the movie makes it more powerful."

      "text": "This film's budget was a mere $100,000, and from that fact alone, I'm amazed at the end result. This is a quality family film that blends football and faith very well. And the best thing is that the \"dorky\" factor that's found in many Christian-oriented films is nowhere to be found here. It includes great football segments which were filmed by a crew from \"Friday Night Lights,\" and you can feel the pain! Granted, this isn't Chariots of Fire or The Chronicles of Narnia, but it IS a great family film that deserves wide exposure. Kudos to Sony for picking it up for distribution."

      "text": "While I will concede with others who said the acting and some technical elements were flawed, I believe also that this film targeted a specific audience - and it nailed it! Secular critics, and - shall we say - the \"unchurched\" will never get this film but will scratch their heads over its overwhelming popularity with people like me. I grew up seeing typical \"preachy\" Christian films and endured them into early adulthood. I have since learned the value of films like \"Star Wars,\" \"A Beautiful Mind,\" and, yes, \"The Departed.\" This story moved my wife and me to tears as we watched it at home. I will be forever grateful to God and to the Sherwood Baptist Church for crafting a story that is so emotionally true and spiritually uplifting. What an awesome achievement!"

Our founding fathers would be so proud of such a film, as everything they beleived in and stood for, (such as, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness), was based on their belief in almighty God. Imagine, the positive impact on Americans, (especially our youth), if our entertainment industry provided similar productions, as the norm. I recommend, anyone breathing,should watch thisfilm! The fact that the movie rating industry placed a PG rating on this film, to warn parents about a message showing that \"all things are possible though God\", is ludicrous!"

It is sappy but very emotional, even more sad than Extreme Makeover home edition. Its very influential, so do not judge this movie on how boring it is, because it is, but its excellent."

      "text": "I found this movie from searching through good football movies a couple days ago. Then I saw this one and read reviews and having the review talk about how this movie displays a lot of Christianity I jumped on it knowing I had to do a religion movie review. So I watched half the movie on Friday and the other half today (Saturday). I would definitely recommend people to watch this movie as it gives some goof information about Christianity and what that religion can do for people. Also this movie incorporates football in it to make the movie less boring and it definitely helped to send the message of the movie through. The message of the movie was that with God everything is possible. My personal opinion on the movie was that it was decent but not good. It overplayed Christianity. They gave some false information and made it seem like Christianity could solve any problem in the world. But the movie did get it\u2019s point across through a fun movie to watch and I did gain some knowledge about how Christianity can affect people\u2019s lives."

Great effort by the cast and crew... at its core its Human Arrogance Vs Godly Submission.. lots to learn if you are humble and open-minded enough to learn....The element of the supernatural in life's battles is something which even i have experienced while facing my giants...  however this movie is foolishness to those who have been wired and conditioned to like movies that have no element of God or morality in it.."
