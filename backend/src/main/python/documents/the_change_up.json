Reynalds and Bateman have great chemestry and props to both Leslie Mann and Olivia Wilde for getting your gear off and doing it graciously. The movie falls flat with the script, it's half funny,half grating. Though every character is charming and great, the execution of the script however was meh. I thought it was a pretty decent comedy but not as great as other movies are. worth a rental"

Yes, it's WAY over the top in its attempts to gross you out, offend you, and make you squirm - and it earns its R rating with plenty to spare (see the \"Lorno\" scene). But how some critics can give it their lowest rating is beyond me.  (Then again, how a movie like \"BioDome\" gets a \"1\" Metascore is also a head-scratcher....) So no, it's low-brow as hell, but I was entertained, laughed hard, and \"got\" the life lessons. If this is your kind of movie, you'll enjoy it.  If the trailer turned you off in the least, stay far, far away."

It shouldn't need to be said but if you know one of the characters get's a mouth full of baby poop in the opening scenes, you know as a movie buff and a person, it's time to really lower your standards.As soon as you commit to watching a movie as implausible as two characters switching bodies because they both peed in public fountain while they were drunk, then you have to put your guard down; you cannot rate it like you would an art film. It's a comedy and a good one. Watch it with your friends though; movies like this are designed for a) people with a penis and b) external laughter. Schindler's List is for watching alone.And yes, @RowenaB, dude movies rely heavily derision; it's a staple of male-on-male comedy. If you remove that then all you have left is chick flicks and what explosion-loving male wants to live in a world like that?I'm rating this an 8 - as a comedy - not as a film."

While those who don't have a specific best friend who they've known since childhood might not enjoy this, all best friends should find it hilarious and heartwarming, if you can believe it. Bateman and Reynalds are phenomenal together, and their female counterparts do a bang-up job too. Though some may find it offensive and disgusting (especially a scene where Bateman's infant son craps in his mouth), this movie is well done and definitely worth your time."

Bateman had a decent year in 2011, but The Change-up knocked him down a few pegs.  This film suffered from the same syndrome that Bridesmaids did, with writers and directors trying to FORCE something to be funny by being as raunchy, gross, and disgusting as possible."

      "text": "\"The Change-Up\", more so than prior body-swapping movies(three of them in 1987 alone), makes it perfectly clear that this comedy subgenre overlaps into horror territory, an encompassing that works as a reimagining of \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\", but played for laughs. While alien dopplegangers exhibit the same contrastive behavior as people caught in the throes of demonic possession, the latter malady discomfits the notion of genre fluidity, because the tell-tale signs of somebody afflicted by the devil would be overtly self-evident(running the gamut from an altered voice to vomiting), thereby making easy ingratiation within the subtext too difficult. On the other hand, if the person is being replaced by a pod replicant, it normally takes the skeptic a longer time to accept this absence of the self, as reported by loved ones who know that their mother, uncle, and love interest(from the 1956 original) are impostors. In 1978, Phillip Kaufman remade the sci-fi classic, and picked up where Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter left off(in that cave of Dr. Bennett's discontent), by focusing, again, on a man and woman, but this time remaking the couple as husband and wife, because who better than a spouse to recognize the perceptible change in what has now become a quasi-sentinent being. Soon after Elizabeth shares with Geoffrey her news about the strange plant she discovered in the Bay Area terra firma, the husband stops acting like his usual self. Now he's cold and secretive, Elizabeth confides to her friend Matthew, and most startling of all, Geoffrey, a basketball fan, had given away their tickets to a Warriors game. That's definitely not her husband. She feels it in her bones. Although \"The Body Snatcher\" movies have a secure place in two film canons, perhaps sci-fi is the movie series' alpha genre, since in horror flicks, the characters, especially the female ones, are monumentally stupid. Elizabeth is smart. She knows right away that \"Geoffrey isn't Geoffrey anymore,\" whereas Jamie takes forever to detect the \"po[t] person\" inhabiting her typically dependable husband. The mediated content belonging to horror and sci-fi productions are often amalgamable because within the diegesis of both simulacra worlds, the physical laws which govern their corporeal duplicate are broken in the same fantastical manner. Whereas Elizabeth diagnoses the change in Geoffrey after a single post-transformation encounter, Jamie, even after being told about the \"change-up\", and having witnessed Dave's brusque way with Cara over dinner, Mann plays a variation of the dumb blond by not catching on to the switch. Her surprising nudity, albeit common to the modern sex comedy, also has a longstanding alliance with the slasher flick . Despite being sexually active, Jamie survives, undermining a time-honored trope that only virgins are spared the wrath of patriarchy, but perhaps connubial sex is allowed to go unpunished. While it's a fallacy to purport that Jaime could die in a comedy as broad as \"The Change-Up\", theoretically, her amulet(a wedding band), which makes sexual intercourse filmically permissible without any violent repercussions, could have potentially lost its special powers, if not for her exotic gastronomic predilections, which as luck would have it, works as a preventive measure against sex with Mitch, therefore averting the retributional hazards that comes with the territory of being \"the bad girl\", or in this case, the adulterer. To the lothario, Jamie's loose bowel movements signifies the devil's work, since the film itself establishes fecal matter as owning a connotative value, when during a diaper change, Dave is on the receiving end of some projectile defecating, which recalls the green bile that ends up on the young priest's face in  \"The Exorcist\". The filmmaker thinks like Mitch: women and babies are devils. The anomalous conduct of the baby, albeit mounted as slapstick comedy, nevertheless encompasses a comportment that hews close to horror, especially in a later scene, where another baby throws a cleaver in Mitch's direction, as if with the intent to kill like one of those mutant infants in \"It's Alive\". This womanizer is worse than Alfie, the mod playboy of swinging London in the 1966 film starring Michael Caine. He's like the dog-man(a human head affixed to a boxer's body) who makes Elizabeth scream in the Kaufman film. Unlike Alfie, who eventually befriends the dog that brackets the movie(therefore separating himself from the canine metaphor of his dastardly way with women), Mitch appears to be the end-result of a merger between man and animal. The paternal agony, upon seeing his son with another father redeems Alfie, who breaks the fourth wall with silence instead of his usual glib remarks. Mitch, on the other hand, doesn't respect Dave's family or job, and has no such redeemable moment. His horror is a human one; he loves nobody, not even himself."

I know that I love R-Rated comedies that work to be entertaining of funny people and some wild stuff that every movies done, but it has to be a reason for it. Here's my problem for this mean spirited movie: 1. Why this guy is so idiot that he's acts like a fool to his best friend and the entire family? 2. Why there's CGI baby hitting his head too many times and the baby pumps out in his butt? I'm liking, what??? 3. There's a porn scene where this guy is doing a nasty stuff for letting this woman to suck inside her butt? WHY??? That's not FUNNY!!! 4. Why this guy is calling his switcha best friend to help him to fix those two babies, while one of those babies are making hazard things into a threat dangerous stuff? If you're doing to make babies to come themselves, and why were you doing talking on the phone while those babies make them dangerous stuff! I mean WHAT IS THIS??? I have no idea what this movie is trying to be funny or not. For me, I don't think this movie will bring more intentions to be nasty and too much stupidity of every two best friends are the worst written guys ever! I really hate this movie to be so raunchy, too wild, and too idiot at the same time, and it fails that I would rather smack my head that drops down on my giggling sense. So I written down on my spoiler, so you know what I just told on my review. Bottom line, The Chane-Up is stupid and more STUPID!!!"

While the premise for this movie is tired, overdone and the green-lighting of this movie could have been considered a very questionable move, the fact is, the hard R The Change-Up has earned has also given a very adult and empathetic undertone. The movie has much more of a message than its vulgarity implies and it is flawlessly delivered by two of the most underrated comedic actors in Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds.  I absolutely adored this movie, squirmed often, but eventually smiled a very pleasant smile at the pure sweetness of its message.  I highly recommend it!"

Why most of comedies today have to be so stupid ? Anyway, Jason Bateman (Dave Lockwood) and Ryan Reynolds (Mitch Planko) are best friends, which seems weird for so many reason. In the movie, it says that there friends since third grade, but they really don't look the same age. Each of them have different personalities (almost opposite), but somehow their together. I'm not sure in real life these kind of people would be friends. Has you already know, they switch bodies, which we saw a hundred times before. I was impressed that you could really '' see '' that these characters have changed lives. Jason and Ryan did a good job changing the roles. Their acting was believable. It's not a terrible movie.

That said, this movie is formulaic and derivative. The first half sees the comedy and gags aimed at those around the 12-15 year old age category, pandering to the teenage humor of feces and breasts. Don't get me wrong, I love a good cack joke as much as the next guy, and this isn't too low brow for me, it's just that it feels forced. Oddly the second half of the movie tries to get a little deeper after the story reaches its arc.All in all there are a few laughs here, but probably not worth the price of admission, and ultimately a big let down."
