      "text": "Fury of the Gods wasn't really that great. The story feels like a series of sketches that miss cohesion. I think the premise was really good, but the execution and writing was poor. The fast dialogues (way too fast at time) and forced jokes broke the rhythm a lot. I didn't feel invested in the characters because I didn't have time to do so. The CGI were a bit better then the first movie. But I couldn't help seeing some Green Lantern effects in there.  The acting was unequal but that was to be expected. But the movie focus too much on Freddy for my taste, and they gave him hyper fast dialogues, that didn't favour his character. The villains were' I don't know...just there. The music and sounds were ok. I give it 53%. All the personal stuff is briefly skimmed and never truly explored. It's an action movie with barely any intelligible humour and any convincing drama."

Of course not forgetting the love of a young man of 15 years with a goddess of 6000... would it be pedophilia?"

I'm little disappointed with this sequel... Lot of bad jokes. Long product placement for Skittles. Cheap cameos. Still quite fun and watchable, I like this family dynamic... Anyway, the big reboot is coming so why we should care? And no: it's not \"Superhero Film Fatigue\" - it's \"Bad CGI and Mediocre Story Fatigue\"!"

Nesse sentido, ao menos podemos dizer que ele \u00e9 eficiente.N\u00e3o me canso de dizer que filmes infantis n\u00e3o precisam ser necessariamente idiotices puras. Temos a\u00ed filmes da Pixar/Disney para comprovar. Mas tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o quer dizer que necessariamente precisam ser profundos. Est\u00e1 tudo bem criar roteiros p\u00edfios como aqui e se entregar a divers\u00e3o.H\u00e1, no entanto, muitos e muitos furos, al\u00e9m de incont\u00e1veis momentos em que, por exemplo, a vil\u00e3 poderia acabar com tudo e fica conversando por v\u00e1rios minutos at\u00e9 vir algu\u00e9m e desarmar. O roteiro beira o amadorismo, e o manique\u00edsmo de quem \u00e9 bom ou mau beira o rid\u00edculo, sem contar que uma das personagens muda instantaneamente, sem pudor algum.A DC aqui pega o que h\u00e1 de pior nos filmes da Marvel e insere em duas horas de proje\u00e7\u00e3o. Se voc\u00ea for com o m\u00ednimo desejo de ver uma boa hist\u00f3ria, melhor n\u00e3o ir, e se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o curte piadas bobinhas, a\u00ed mesmo que deve passar longe.Ainda bem que eu fui assistir de cora\u00e7\u00e3o leve e muito bem tranquilo com o material, por isso n\u00e3o me arrependi tanto assim, consegui at\u00e9 mesmo dar boas risadas, ainda que entrasse f\u00e1cil como um dos piores do ano."

      "text": "\"Shazam! Fury of the Gods\" was...  Kind of a letdown.  As a huge Shazam fan, I went into this movie with the utmost positivity, but my upbeat optimism was dashed by this films lack of focus.  None of the events in this movie seemed to flow naturally and everything was just happening off of a conveyor belt.  This, coupled with some VERY unthreatening, non-canon, movie exclusive antagonist's, made for an experience that seemed more like filler than anything else.  Speaking of the antagonists of this film, Helen Mirren and Lucy Liu did an excellent job in their roles as Hespera and Kalypso and were definitely the stand outs, but even their combine powers of brilliant thespianism were no match for the evil that is DCEU's knack for fumbling their films.There was at least one scene at the end of the movie that was kinda cool, but it really doesn't make up for the rest of the movies inability to \"wow\" me.  This was not what I would call a \"worthy sequel\" to the first Shazam movie.  Not only does it pale in comparison to the original, but it will more than likely dissipate from most peoples memories shortly after they\u2019ve watched it."

Fury of the Gods borders at many points on a line that almost makes it a children's film.The constant need for humor clouds any attempt at seriousness and only manages to get a touch of drama in its climax that frankly doesn't add up to anything.The show entertains for the most part, but considering the reboot that's coming, Shazam gives no reason to stick around in the DCEU. A shame.* Though the first post-credits scene gives a minuscule hint that maybe James Gunn does have him considered for what's to come. But like I said it's minuscule.** And only for a small mention. Grace Caroline Currey as Mary Marvel is"

These super hero directors clearly don't understand comics, they violate orginal content and value nothing but their own ego's. The movie has the audacity to have the original Billy Batson in the movie regulated to some basic extra. Its insulting and careless. Have lost just about all faith in DC and Marvel is not far behind. Is it even possible to make a super hero movie about the character and not someones convoluted vision."

Fury Of The Gods was also pretty much the same like the first Shazam! with according to me an obvious better villain, it's still an entertaining fun soft movie overall, no big improvement from the first one but i do kinda like this one a bit more, from now the whole family involved and again better villain, with good performance by all the cast, i like the look of the monster creatures that they create, a very entertaining battle sequence, and nice little and powerful surprises at the end, Shazam!

      "text": "More enjoyable for me than the reviews led me to believe.  Another movie with at least eight director-level collaborators:  a 2nd unit director plus seven VFX directors one for each house working pre, post and during production.  When so many people who love telling stories well collaborate, the result is almost always impressive on multiple levels.  As regularly happens in pro reviews of most super hero movies, the Great Expectations pattern takes over.  The final movie is criticized for what it is not; and, for what it could have been.  This is the fast way to become a jaded and cynical movie reviewer.  I recommend finding the moments which do work for you, try to ignore the rest on first viewing.  As the negative pro reviews observe, Shazam 2 is very much a movie with a 2010 mindset, perseverating on familiar tropes which ran out of oomph a decade or more ago.  I did not find Helen Mirren and Lucy Liu \"bland.\" I did find the stereotyped limitations of their roles and dialog very 1990s. The most literate, considered pro reviews on S2 Ive seems so far are from Owen Gleiberman in Variety and Jacob Oller at Paste."
