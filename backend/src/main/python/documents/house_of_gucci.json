Ridley Scott, who seems to have slid joyfully into his \u201cI\u2019m 83, why wouldn\u2019t I make this movie\u201d phase, settled into the director\u2019s chair and proceeded to direct the daylights out of his cast"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The Best movie I have ever seen.

Everyone had a debate about Gaga's accent, but Adam's is almost non-existent and bad in the whole movie, very questionable, in short, the others in the cast do it well. Ridley Scott is, perhaps, my second favorite direct, although the direction fulfills its objective, it is not the genre of film that is very good.  Bentivegna has a very good script and not at all complicated.  Dariusz Wolski your cinematography is so good, man, but Claire, your editing and editing kills how great House of Gucci could be, although I don't give you all the credit;  the story is very long, it would have been a better option to make it a miniseries of 5 chapters, 1 hour each, but hey, there is no going back. The soundtrack is not surprising, it is just a handful of songs through the 3 decades that the film spans. I do not think it is the best movie in which Gaga appears, but it is in House of Gucci her true debut, where she breaks free from the character of a singer and immerses herself in one where they have no resemblance.  I think that what I had the least faith in turned out to be the best."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This film is everything I wanted.
