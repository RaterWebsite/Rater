      "text": "(Mauro Lanari)A B movie that dares to escape the banal horror of \"The Conjuring\" saga to return to the unresolved points of the omnipervasiveness of evil (the famous thesis of Hanna Arendt was refuted by Milgram with his experiment). 3rd millennium and the Pauline \"mysterium iniquitatis\" of 2 Thessalonians 2:7, as well as Boethius (430) and Leibniz (1710), still ask in vain: \"si Deus non est, unde bonum?\". Among the blockbusters one has to go back no less than \"Seven/Se7en\" (Fincher 1995) to relive similar emotions."
