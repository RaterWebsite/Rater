One of the greatest movies of all time (in MY opinion)."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Big Fish is a peculiar movie, even for being a Tim Burton picture. It is about the life of a man whose father loves to tells stories from the time he was young, but the problem is that the anecdotes are hard to believe, because there are extremely rare and unlikely to happen; for example the story of the eye of a witch that can tell you when you are going to die, the one of a giant who is convinced to leave and stop terrifying a town, the circus that is managed by a werewolf or the scape from a war with two Siamese. All this produce constant fights between Edward and his son; and this is one of the topics that Tim Burton treats on his films. Although the other topics from this great director are less developed they are also noticeable: the gothic and expressionist characters (the witch, the giant and the circus manager) and environments (the forest and the witch house); and the contrast between two worlds represented graphically, the present in which Edward tells his stories (darker or opaque colors) and the past in which the stories take place (bright and attractive colors).\rThe thing is that does not matter if the anecdotes were real or not, you decide what you want to believe, you can live a boring life and had nothing interesting to tell, no dreams, no hope, no goals; or you can live an amazing life, with endless stories to tell and enjoy being a Big Fish."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Very touching...!!

Big Fish is I think one of Burton's better movies in my personal opinion, maybe not his very best, but it is a very sweet, imaginative and moving film. Here Burton delves into familiar territory, a strange place between reality and fantasy, dream and nightmare. The story is really sweet, and while slow at times, does have a poignant ending. The visuals as pretty much always in a Tim Burton film are gorgeous, not Gothic here like in Sleepy Hollow and Edward Scissorhands but evergreen and picturesque. The scenery was beautiful and so was the cinematography, and Danny Elfman's score is stunning. His score for Edward Scissorhands blew me away, but the lyrical, sensitive and hypnotic themes used here make it a score that is truly special. The screenplay is well crafted, and has a bittersweet feel to it. Sentimental yes, but also bittersweet. The acting is remarkably good, with Ewan McGregor making for a handsome yet somewhat charming young Edward Bloom, and the wonderful Albert Finney a revelation as his older self. Billy Crudup is excellent as the son who is intent on exposing his father, and sets out to learn the truth, and Danny DeVito is great as the shape-changing circus ringmaster. Jessica Lange is beautiful and alluring as Sandra and Helena Bonham Carter is almost unrecognisable as the Witch. Then there is Alison Lohman, Marion Cottilard, Robert Guillaume and Matthew McGory(as Karl the Giant) and they are very good as well. Overall, I loved this film, it is moving and very imaginative. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Big Fish is Tim Burton's masterpiece.

It is a film of such tremendous imagination and such poignancy in its moments of genuine emotion, that when it betrays itself for a shallow and unfair resolution, you're astonished at how everything about it has gone to waste. The audience feels betrayed that everything they've come to enjoy takes a turn for something they would like to avoid, such as unresolved emotion disguised as closure, and selfish actions being accepted."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Burtons best and brightest. Big Fish is really a delightful and touching movie, it truly is one of my favorite movies of all time. While i've often found Tim Burton movies to be a little on the odd side, this one was odd but also had a sweet and serious touch to it when you see beautifully done movie about a man whose life becomes a legend through the stories he told his kid growing up. No one film can be as amazing as this one, and with great performances all around as well, especially Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Ewan McGregor, Billy Crudup and Alison Lohman, Big Fish is a masterpiece if there is a definition of one. It challenges the cynicism brought on by adulthood and brings us back to where our imagination begins and where our dreams can end, a place where everything and anything is possible."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "A most imaginative film, this movie shows some thought in plot construction.

Wallace's novel has enough room for the tale to be both practical and fictional, his characters can fly and still be grounded. And frankly August's adaptation doesn't have that. And it itches the picture throughout the course and is why Burton keeps leaning on to practicality, he somehow feels obliged to keep it true and on track. As far as all the tactics that paints the fantasy world on screen, it is Burton's home ground.That half of the tale is not only intriguing but exhilarating to encounter, it is also emotionally fueled. The emotions, in fact are real, the giant, the red car, the daffodils and the witch, these are the facts. And Burton never feels short handed in such genre. Ticking for two hours, the overkill sets in early. And that somehow fortunately follows up to be McGregor's strength. He gets enough time and range on screen for us to fall in love with him, when he does, and laugh at him when he is having fun. But personally, I prefer, Ed Bloom when Finney plays it.He is more mature and overprotective as much as stubborn he is. His last act with his son is what the entire movie thrives on. The supporting cast like Cotillard, Crudup and Carter fails to live up to the lead ones. Burton emerges the emotions aptly on screen, it's the mechanism that it follows needs some polishing. Merely as a concept wise, it can be an intriguing discussion for a dinner table conversation but as far as major motion picture is concerned, Big Fish is frankly a stretch of an undercooked script that should have broken up a long time ago."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Tim Burton's masterpiece.

An imaginative film that is very much about the men it concerns more so than the stories told here, Big Fish is a winner because of the heart at its core, more so than the stories it told that may not make much sense and could have been told better.
