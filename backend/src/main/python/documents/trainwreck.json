In fact, I would argue that BRIDE WARS has a more cutting and daring message to deliver than TRAINWRECK or any of Schumer's or Apatow's work. Pile on to that, TRAINWRECK is simply too long, lethargic, and just not very funny. And perhaps worse than anything, poor Brie Larson, who is quite the actress, is here relegated to playing the sister/homemaker with no bite or attitude.

She is rude, crude, very promiscuous and doesn\u2019t believe in spending a whole night with any of her tricks.

Whether it is due to Schumer, or the director Judd Apatow, there is a lot of male nudity, mainly full backsides, with one exceptional funny almost frontal nudity, and very little female nudity though Amy is shown in many sex scenes--almost always wearing a bra if not fully clothed.\r Billed as a comedy I will say the audience, consisting of equal men and women, were laughing through most of it. I smiled here and there but didn\u2019t have a really good laugh until 1 hour and 55 minutes into the 2 hour and 2 minute movie. I was also touched in 2 scenes and shook my head in a couple of scenes that seemed to be from another movie.\r This is the first time I have really seen Amy Schumer and I enjoyed her performance but wondered if in real life she only wears too short skirts! I admired Bill Hader in last year\u2019s \u201cThe Skeleton Twins\u201d and he has a lot of  chemistry with Schumer. Watching her first serious relationship, and the problems she has with it, makes for a different romantic comedy as does the leads not being pretty picture actors.\r Due to Hader\u2019s profession in the movie, as a sports medicine doctor/surgeon, there are a lot of  cameos by sports names plus, as usual, in any Apatow movies there are cameos by names who don\u2019t get billing until the end credits. Of the sports figures in the movie LeBron James has more than a cameo role playing himself as a skinflint cheap, and concerned friend of the doctor, being naturally funny and has a one on one basketball scene with Hader that cracked the audience up! Also in the film is Brie Larson as Schumer\u2019s sister who is the complete opposite in her relationship of Amy with her husband,  Mike Birbiglia. John Cena\u2019s as Amy\u2019s dumb, muscle bound, everything he says comes out with gay connotations, current friend with benefits and Tilda Swinton as her very strange boss are welcome additions as are Randall Park and Vanessa Bayer as co-workers.

Occasionally you hear someone say that having a likable protagonist is not important. They're wrong (and I suspect they are jerks who secretly identify with jerk protagonists).
