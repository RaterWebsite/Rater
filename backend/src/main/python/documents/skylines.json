Liam O\u2019Donnell also directed the first sequel, and I have to say that that one was way more rewarding than this one, even within its range and its own limitations, something that it doesn't achieve.Nothing better to watch/weekend film."

      "text": "I've seen all three; this is by far the best. If you like sci-fi FX and can tolerate sci-fi tropes, this is kind of Tomb Raider in Space.  The female hero's journey works for me.  Writing and acting is a few notches above TV movie, except physical sets and VFX which are close to AAA.  The making-of feature reinforces the impression morale on set was high, always a good foundation for a fun watch."

      "text": "D: The film's finishedP: Cool, is at least as good as the first two? Oh, and what's the runtime?D: Yeah, it takes a bit of a different direction though, but you'll love it.P: That's great, how long is it?D: It has great SFX, we've switched from Independence Day to Stargate as a theme. Also crammed in all those Aliens references you wanted.P: Super. You seem to be avoiding questions about it's length though?D: How to you mean?P: You know, runtime, length, duration, how long does my bladder have to hold out since we don't have intervals now?D: Ah, well, it's a little over 3,600 seconds.P: You mean an hour?D: No, well, yeah, okay. It is. But it does everything it needs to. Honest.P: Dude, the third instalment has to be be the longest - we've really got to be pushing bladder control here! The studio demands it.D: Well, I've got nothing else....P: How about we hire someone to direct a really high quality first half that won't feel like it's been crammed in at all?D: Yeah, cool. Can we keep the same dialog writer though?P: What, you mean the fella who wrote \"There's no use fighting it\", \"Now I am become death\", \"We're not in Kansas anymore\", \"I have to finish this myself\" and other such classics?D: Yeah, that's him!P: Okay, whatever. But what about that line \"Between your serum and my ship we have enough power now to cure everyone.\"?D: What do you mean?P: So, how does Rose know about the Serum?D: Well, um, you know, she just does, she has alien super powers or magic or something....P: And how does the doc know about Rose's ship?D: Well, err, again, ah, ok, okay, hmm...P: Look, never mind. Folk will love it anyway - it's proper action filled, disengage brain B-Movie fodder like the first two.D: We also have a load of outtakes in the end titles - does that help?P: Hell yes, why didn't you mention that before? We'll just get a temp to churn out the first half - an outtake reel fixes everything!D: what about the critics - what will they think?P: \"There's no use fighting it\" maybe? Oh, look, they'll probably think it's arty or something - we've got the acting legend James Cosmo in a staring role after all!D: Who?"

      "text": "This film takes everything great from the previous 2 installments and really pushed those few elements in what is the best of the 3 films. Skylin3s is a fun and enjoyable action/sci fi film Lindsey Morgan is a great lead and a fan favorite in the genre with her badass portrayal of Raven in the 100."

      "text": "Finally a decent sci-fi action movie (which isn't just a totally unrelated drama or political manifest with some sci-fi background occasionally), it might not have a perfectly crafted plot in places but you see how hard they tried to make it good and they succeeded.Good:- Action- Plot- Characters- Acting- Touching momentsMinus:- some rough edges on the plot side if you pay close attention but who cares"
