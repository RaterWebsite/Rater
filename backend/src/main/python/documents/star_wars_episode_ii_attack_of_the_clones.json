      "text": "The locations are memorable and interesting; the craggy canyons of Geonosis and the torrential storms of Kamino were immediately imprinted in my head when I first saw them. The CGI strengthens the film-the action sequences look amazing, from the speeder chase at the film's beginning, to the ending confrontation between the Jedi and Count Dooku. Seeing Yoda finally whip out his lightsaber and fight was very exciting. I don't get why people complain about him jumping around during the fight, though; such acrobatics show an interesting contrast between Yoda's age, and his actual power in the Force, and skill in lightsaber combat. No one would expect a 874-year-old green troll to have such mobility. Each of the planets is a representation of what is happening on the planet. Coruscant is shrouded in fog, Kamino is shrouded in mystery, and Geonosis is shrouded in violence; each is part of the shroud of the dark side that is ever-present in the film-in one of the main characters, and in the events that move the story along. I liked the characters of Obi-Wan, Padm\u00e9, and Anakin, as well as each of the conflicts and struggles they faced in the film. Again, I didn't get the accusations of \"wooden\" acting and \"boring\" characters. When watching the film, I believed that the characters were the characters, not actors playing characters. Lucas delivered another good screenplay, with some help from Jonathan Hales, and the politics-as well as the machinations of the Sith, and the slow erosion of the Republic-are fantastically done. Not only that, but the characters are believable and realistic for the situations they are placed in. The romance between Anakin and Padm\u00e9 has been ridiculed for being \"cheesy\" and \"clich\u00e9d,\" but I think the moments and dialogue between them are perfect for their situation, as well as the universe that they live in. Besides, I love a romance between \"star-crossed\" lovers. Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones is a wonderfully-done film, and it is certainly worth your time to watch the second episode of the Star Wars saga."

As a stand-alone film it would've been a disaster, so I can understand why people hated it right when it came out. But now with the third installment in the prequel trilogy being released, we really get to see Anakin grow, and I love seeing how loyal Obi-Wan stays to the Jedi order. Its nice to see how Obi-Wan questioned his master at the time Qui Gonn on his decisions, and then when Obi-Wan is Anakin's Master Andkin questions Obi-Wan. It's nice to see how they can relate because once they were both very similar in their wiseness. Now moving on to actual story plots in this film, I think that Count Dooku is a very compelling character and had some great power. The problem is the way they portrayed him in this film that I don't love because he just comes off as boring. I believe the Star Wars animated series The Clones Wars was a much better portrayal of Count Dooku. Even still no matter how much you hate this film you must admit that the epic Clone, Jedi, Droid battle is incredible. It may be filled with CGI but It still feels like you're right there. And let us not forget this film's predecessor The Phantom Menace! This film was... well a train wreck. They focused more on politics and less on what stars wars is all about, which is an insanely entertaining story and amazing special effects. I will say that the characters were written well. There are many reasons to enjoy this entertaining film and that's why I'm glad its a part of the fantastic series that is Star Wars."

      "text": "This film shows the beginning of rebellion movements within the Galactic Republic and the events leading up to the start of the war. Directed by George Lucas, it was written by him, in collaboration with Jonathan Hales, and count's with the participation of Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Christopher Lee, Samuel L. Jackson and Ian McDiarmid, among other actors.George Lucas has learned an important lesson from the previous film: special effects and action can make a bearable movie, but cannot make a quality movie. And it's not hard to see that the Director made an effort to ensure a more careful script this time. The script looks cleaner of expendable elements and worthless characters, and the characters exhibit much more psychological depth, particularly Anakin and Amidala. However, Lucas was unable to print passion to the loving bond that the couple starred. If there is love there, the public never see it or feel it. It seems friendship or affection, but never love so, they managed to become one of the most frigid romantic couples that cinema ever portrayed. Jar Jar continues to be a funny character but there are certain scenes when he's just stupid. The performance of the actors wasn't brilliant or inspired, with the exception of Samuel L. Jackson and Christopher Lee, who deserve congratulations, and Natalie Portman, who was not bad but could have done better. The soundtrack also does not bring anything new and does it's role with confidence. The special visual and sound effects were at the highest level, providing breathtaking action scenes and moments of great dramatic tension. The costumes, characterization and scenery were always up to the challenge, not disillusioned the most enthusiastic fans."

      "text": "SKIP TO THE END FOR REVIEW SUMMARY.Attack of the Clones, like its predecessor, is yet another highly controversial and underrated installment in the Star Wars saga.The movie is, for the most part, split between two stories. The first follows Anakin Skywalker and Padm\u00e9 Amidala which is largely a romance story. The second is a detective-esque story in which Obi-Wan Kenobi discovers two separate armies that are being built to begin the Clone Wars. Ewan McGregor's superb acting definitely makes Obi-Wan's side of the film more entertaining and mysterious, but Anakin and Padm\u00e9's story is by no means awful.I'd be one of the first to say that the Anakin and Padm\u00e9 love story has some cringe-worthy dialogue but it makes sense within the context of the universe and the characters. Anakin, a Jedi, has been taught to not love anyone and to have no emotional attachments. Obviously, he would be a little awkward when it comes to these things. Their story takes a more interesting turn when Anakin returns to his home planet in search of his mother.The entire third act of the film is simply phenomenal. A fight with monsters in an arena, followed by the first battle of the Clone Wars, and then a lightsaber battle between Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and Yoda really help elevate the last 45 minutes or so of the movie to among the best in Star Wars history. The first act also had some solid action and intrigue with an assassination plot against Padm\u00e9. The second act is definitely the weakest, mainly because it drags on a little.The discovery and intrigue elements of Attack of the Clones definitely make it a great addition to the Star Wars saga. It's a little too long for my taste but other than that, I have no huge complaints.Review was redone ahead of The Last Jedi."

      "text": "Attack of the Clones is not bad. To me, people who have a major hatred towards this film look at the originals with nostalgia glasses on. While Episodes V and VI are great, A New Hope is horrifically bad at times. Featuring awful acting and even worse special effects and writing, the original Star Wars film seems to be the basis for the prequel trilogy, as Attack of the Clones has some awful, awful writing (particularly the cringeworthy romance scenes) and some bad sequences of CGI. However, I will say that the special effects on the whole are vast improved. The acting, while not good, is nowhere near as bad as it was in the original. The original felt like amateur hour. In this one, you can tell these people are professionals, while is good. The action sequences in Attack of the Clones are all very good and the fight choreography is vast improved when compared to its predecessors. Finally, there is some killer cinematography in this one that really underscores how much time was put into making this one good. Overall, Attack of the Clones is not as good as the best of the Star Wars franchise, but is far from being the worst entry in the series."

His slow transition into the Dark Side is perfectly presented. Ian Mac Diarmid (Palpatine), Evan McGregor and Cristopher Lee deliver fantastic emotions and AAA+ acting.

Dooku makes a superb thought provoking anti-hero who shows he's more than capable of holding his own against youngsters which I love so much as it shows that the elderly can identify themselves to be strong and powerful if they want. The beauty of Coruscant at night was mesmerising, every time I watch the bar scene I always get drunk and happy, it's such a great scene which encourages people to have so much fun so it's a great thing. The beauty of the Outlander Club in the film makes me so sexually aroused. There's loads of intelligent aliens in this film which promotes that diversity is a true strength, with many sexy aliens there as well. It could've been better though if Anakin found his Mother and brutally sexually abused her fat butt, his Mother should've liked the sex eventually before killing her because she selfishly gave him up to strangers and didn't bother visiting him for 10 years. The sex scene between Anakin and his Mother would've also helped promote that it's okay to have sex with your Mum as everyone's the same anyway, if everyone wasn't the same diversity wouldn't be a strength. And killing her like that would show that Anakin is normal and doesn't care about people who are closely genetically related to him more than people who aren't closely genetically related to him. Due to George Lucas, Anakin's a racist who treated his evil Mother far more nicely than what her fat butt deserved."

But its not a New Hope, an Empire Strikes Back, or even a Return of the Jedi...sadly. Attack of the Clones succeeds in many areas but fails in many more. As said with the Phantom Menace review, the key things that made the original trilogy so magical were its story and characters, universe, and the good acting. Attack of the Clones ties together many, many loose ends lying around with the series, and brings in adult Anakin Skywalker played by Hayden Christensen, who is ultimately dull and boring as an actor and feels sadly even worse than his younger version seen in the Phantom Menace.\rEwan McGregor is however, much better in AotC than Phantom Menace, seeing an overall stronger performance. Natalie Portman has improved slightly too, but still gives a bit of a \"I'm only here to fill in the role\" look off. The performances are overall average, and nothing compared to the original trilogy.\rThe characters are interesting and while Jar-Jar Binks is briefly seen we don't have to deal with his abomination of a character on screen for long. We see Boba Fett's father, the birth of the stormtroopers, and Anakin Skywalker's looming fate, and its all very great. The new CGI produced Yoda and other aliens makes the experience all the more realistic and is cool.\rBut when it adds up for what it is, AotC is still a very, very, very flawed piece of work, that while action packed and fun, lacks the flair or audacity of the original three, and what made them so great."
