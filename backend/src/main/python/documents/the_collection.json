In fact quite the opposite. I fidgeted through the movie. I know studios have a certain quota of films they feel like they have to make, but really? The story is just out there and dumb. If you want blood and guts go to a slaughterhouse, at least that is real. If you want to be scared, watch the evening news. If you want to get your date in the mood, try alcohol. This movie does seem to hit any of the marks. If you are young and want to watch a \"messed up\" movie, put A Clockwork Orange in your Netflix queue.

An explosive opening sequence sets the mood for the rest of the film as its very fast paced and there's always something going on! Arkin is back which is great and we pick up from where the first one finished.

It was intense the way the first ended, leaving the viewer dangling!! Then there was the three-year wait for the sequel! It was worth it! I did not foresee the role-reversal, very masterful!!

Lovers of the genre know well that typically sequels are never as good as the first; this one manages to be a blood-soaked, terrifying good time!! I highly recommend these movies!

The bad guy is creepy looking enough.\r The Bad: Comical gore and slasher horror.

The characters are less developed that you'd expect, even for this genre as the majority of them barely say hello before being decapitated, maimed, or sliced up.

If you enjoy torture-porn flicks then you will like this and know what to expect. Horror movie fans might find themselves alienated do to the lack of any sort of scares and a focus gruesome and bloody kills. That being said the movie is still highly watchable, it just has some issues that keep it from being considered a great movie. Just like its predecessor \"The Collection\" is basically just one intense game of cat and mouse. It's entertaining enough to keep you watching, but lacks any sort of meaningful plot. For instance we get to see the killer do all sorts of sick and twisted things, but we never get any sort of reasoning as to why he does what he does. This clearly shows that the focus is on the blood and gore, but it would have been nice to know what made the killer tick, and what pushed him over the edge. Still if you go into this just expecting to see some gruesome deaths and wont mind a lackluster plot then \"The Collection\" might entertain. Just keep in mind that it's not the greatest flick out there."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The Collection starts off right where 2009's The Collector leaves off. The former was such a popular direct-to-video rental, that it's sequel actually wound up on the big screen, and how it avoided an NC-17 rating is beyond me. I've seen a ton of Horror movies, it's one of my favorite genres, so I can say, without hesitation that The Collection is one of the creepiest, goriest, and most clever Horror films I have ever seen. This crazed man in a mask is looking to collect certain types of people and if they pass his test, they can join his collection. If they fail, they become experiments in human suffering. In the first film, we see career criminal, Arkin O'Brien, fighting for his life. In the sequel, we see Arkin escape and lead a band of mercenaries back to the Collectors hideout, in order to rescue a captured rich girl. Of course once they get there, they find a maze of terror that rivals any film you've ever seen. I thought some of the machines in the Saw films were clever, but until you see this film, you haven't seen anything yet! How people come up with these things is beyond rational thought. Of all the ways to torture people, to come up with machines and techniques that exceed everything we've seen before is just sick...sick and very cool. The cast is the same as in every Horror movies, a bunch of dumb, no named actors, following a couple of smart people in order to stay alive as long as they can. What's special here is the story, the affects, and the level of depravity. The Collection is one of the most violent and gruesome Horror films to come along in years. It's the first step in the evolution of Horror that fans have been waiting for for years."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "meh I was definatly hoping for this movie to be better thn it was yet it wasn't a total disappointment. It didn't live up to the original in that it had a few unintentionally cheesy moments but it still upped the gore level."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "This movie was different.  If you are expecting a Saw type movie, you will be disappointed.  It does, however, bring that well thought out feeling that you got from the Saw movies.  It is just that the believabliltiy factor is a zero. From hundreds of deaths and kidnappings, you would figure the police might just consider getting involved.  You would think that the one guy who gets away wouldn't be so easily convinced to go back to the hell hole from which he escaped, but he does.  It is at that point where the movie becomes a cliche' horror movie where you see people die one by one until the villian gets his in the end, only to create the possibility for more sequels in the future.  Rent this if Redbox is all out of real movies and you will be entertained, but I wouldn't put this at the top of the list."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I actually liked this movie. It was thrilling, gory and the beginning of the movie was pretty amazing. I haven't watched any horror movies, or gore movies in years now, but  I liked the premise of this one and decided to watch, glad I did. I  would recommend it to others who like movies that are a little bit gory and are more of shock value, then the psychology thrillers (used to be my favorite!)."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The Saw similarities make it nothing new, (it was intended to be a Saw prequel, so, come on) but this film works by keeping the suspense going and making a genuinely creepy character out of the Collector that makes you want to keep watching."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The Collection was an epic film! It is a semi-typical horror film with jump scares, but it differs from other horror films I have seen. This film is definitely a nail-biting, tense film that is easy to enjoy if you love gore and death. This film can be watched numerous times without getting bored. One of my top horror films, and  I believe everyone should see this, despite what they hear."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I am a person who rarely loses words. For this movie I have failed to find words to describe how sadly awful this movie is.Apart form its miraculous predictability; this movie makes no sense. The characters are stupid, the killer is stupid, and there is no story like whatsoever.After starting as a possible good movie, all the potential is lost because of the illogical sequence of events that follow. The team who is supposed to go face the manic killer is composed of 5 people; a sad number against a mass murder who is obviously capable of slaughtering them all. Especially that they went to fight him at his shrine, which would obviously be filled with all kinds of traps.To further exacerbate the situation, the movie comes to an abrupt end without making much sense as to where the actors got their sudden strength and existence of a brain from.Perhaps the only two reasons that made me give this movie a rating of one are first, IMDb doesn't allow for a rating of 0 and second, because of the interesting way that the writers chose to show us that the story hasn't ended yet. Although, to say the least, the lack of any interesting material in this one would probably discourage one from watching the next movie.Save yourself a good hour ans 22 minutes and do something else with your life.I can't believe the writers of saw, who are known for their writing genius, went so low as to write such a sad excuse for a horror film.Bottom line: Do Not Watch This.
