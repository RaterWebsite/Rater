      "text": "In a time of bloodshed and war, Brothers attempts to become an instrumental film conveying the psychological effects of individuals in battle.  In order to do so, director Jim Sheriden employs drama within the film, but unfortunately falls flat until the conclusion occurs. This remake of the critically acclaimed 2004 Danish film, Brodre, is a story of two opposite brothers, Tommy Cahill (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire).  Sam is a marine that is about to embark to Afghanistan leaving his two daughters and his wife Grace (Natalie Portman); While Tommy is on parole adjusting to his former life. When Sam is pronounced dead after a plane crash, Tommy attempts to relieve his brother's grieving wife and care for his two children.  When Sam is rescued from Afghanistan, he comes home truly affected by the war mentally. Confused, he is under the assumption that his brother and wife had a sexual relationship.  This causes bitterness within the family and ultimately showing how this war hero loses his inner self.While the premise possesses an immense amount of potential, it never really reaches a high point until the final moments of the film.  From the previews, I was expecting a love triangle-esque film that would enable many dramatic plot twists. But the relationship between Portman and Gyllenhaal remains neutral throughout the film, leaving the film to seem empty. While the plot does create drama, that simply is the problem, it only creates it.  The film never goes anywhere with it and by doing so exposes its own flaws. Although it does not follow the scheme I was under the assumption of, that does not necessarily mean it's a bad film.  As a melodrama movie, it passes as a sufficient source of entertainment.  While the acting sometimes is inconsistent and unreal, it is excellent for the most part.  Gyllenhaal performs with zeal while Mcguire really puts emotion into his character. Portman executes a cute performance, but does not in all actuality contribute to the film as a whole.  Once again referring to it as a melodrama, its plot moves smoothly and emptily creating tension that never really erupts.  The most thrilling part of the movie is the end where Maguire executes his most emotional performance to date.  This satisfied my want for a dramatic thriller, but sadly the journey to this moment was an entertaining soap opera.Brothers is ultimately an acceptable film, but the audience should expect something different than what the trailers promise.  It is not a romantic thriller that depicts a fierce rivalry between brothers, instead it is a full-length soap with a commendable acting cast and efficient commentary on the psychological state of soldiers."

      "text": "Brothers is an emotionally stirring film that really packs a punch when it comes to its examination of PTSD and war. Certainly not pro-military, Brothers thankfully does not go rah rah when it comes to America, instead showcasing how everyone is not necessarily a hero, because you never know what they went through. Even if you think they are, they may vehemently disagree. It's all relative. As someone who is very skeptical when it comes to the military, I greatly appreciated this element. That said, I am not sure I am buying Tobey Maguire as a tough as nails major with his whiny voice. Fortunately, Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman are good enough to overcome that miscasting and really do fit their roles, but the writing is never quite satisfying. Though the story is well told, the film feels too short and the characters not nearly well fleshed out enough, with very little in the way of character development. Gyllenhaal's character completes a 180 without reason and very little explanation as to how, which is problematic. That said, the film's power and sharp acting performances from Gyllenhaal and Portman elevate Brothers into a more than satisfactory look at the darkside of war."

From one angle it's a well acted family drama about a man coming home from war, but from another angle is a confused film with a story that's completely unfocused, it doesn't know which character it wants to highlight. This confusion makes the story lack the depth that the subject material required. I thought some elements of the story-line were forced without any cause or purpose."

      "text": "While the subject of soldiers' post-traumatic stress is important, the overall story felt incomplete. i was surprised that it was not handled better considering the amount of talent that was a part of it. the problem is the script. it is so uneven. maguire's voice over in the beginning says he would do anything to go back to his family, but there are implications as the film goes on that he feels more comfortable being with his \"men\". did i miss something or did maguire's character kill a fellow soldier because he believed his captors would send him home, or did he do it to keep them from killing him? this was a sticky point for me because either way they would have killed him regardless. the performances on the other hand were very good. i think gyllenhaal gave one of his best performances, as did portman. maguire's nuanced performance of this affable, loving father at the start of the moving to a stoic, emotionless soldier while in captivity and then this quietly broken man once he returns home was truly heart wrenching. still i think what maguire's character went through would have worked better in dreams or flashbacks. it would have impacted me more, but i think how maguire inhabits the character is effective. you can see how his mind is working when he bluntly addresses gyllenhaal about whether he slept with portman. he's eerily pleasant in his tone but you can feel that he is steadily loosing control."

Look at the two brothers, and the crimes they both committed. Murder is worse than robbery. Since the movie leaves you with almost no back story to the younger brother, you have to wonder what made him try to rob the bank. I think it's meant to teach that you have to take life objectively. Everyone has a back story, whether you know it or not, and they must be treated that way. As that hoe the younger brother brought to the dinner table, we are all human. That being said, there was something about the characterization of the two brothers that made it too surreal. You just have to kind of take it that they have a history of friendship and love, even though the father would make you think that there was always turmoil in the family, and that the brothers would be far from best friends. The wife was just a drag, nothing more than an object used to represent family earned, anything outside of blood. She had no personality whatsoever. The father also wasn't fleshed out enough. I think if we saw more strategically placed back story, you could make a stronger statement. The acting was decent otherwise. It was a great movie, just short of magnificent."

Jim Sheridan shows the honesty in his characters and everyone in the cast plays them as if they were your neighbors 2 doors down. After years of being in that spider suit, Tobey Maguire confirms to the world that he is an actor to be reckoned with, he is simply devasting in Brothers, a brilliant performance like his pre-spidey days of The Wonder Boys and Pleasantville. Natalie Portman is simply the best actress of her generation, something we've all known since The Professional. Brothers is a great movie, great in its simplicity and honesty, in its writing and directing and in its powerful perfomances. Most of all, Brothers is well worth seeing."

I'm not sure why Maguire is getting plaudits - he alternates between Peter Parker-style goofiness and anguished thousand-yard stare. He didn't convince me like the other two leads. Then there's the misjudged Afghan side story, which is populated by cartoon characters. It might have worked better had we been kept completely in the dark as to the soldier's fate as well, to be put in the same position as the wife and brother. As it is we are just sitting waiting for his inevitable (rather than hoped-for) return and we know any emotional investment during this buildup will be wasted. It feels almost tacked on - like Maguire demanded to be given more to do?"

      "text": "The raging bull has no proof, just a hunch, that Joey(Joe Pesci) is sleeping with Vickie(Cathy Moriarity) behind his back. Jack LaMotta(Robert DeNiro) may, or may not, be right, because Scorsese lets moviegoers decide for themselves if the boxer's paranoia about possible transgressions between his brother and wife are warranted. It's this same sort of ambiguity that \"Brothers\" needs, as Sam(Tobey Maguire), the feisty spider, notes how Tommy(Jake Gyllenhaal) and Grace(Natalie Portman) carry on like teenagers at the skating rink. But the filmmaker telegraphs their innocence, in a scene where the black sheep brother and wife of a \"dead\" G.I. smoke pot and kiss, but nothing more(even though their love would have been a foregone conclusion had fate not intervened). Since the moviegoer knows the limits to their relationship, Sam's point blank accusation of infidelity sounds like the ravings of a madman, and not the prescience of a dead man walking, who knows his existence is practically irrelevant. This tweak to the film's calibration, in which the intimations of a physical relationship looms like an aura, would have kicked the pathos up a notch, because the moviegoer sees how Sam's death was the best thing that ever happened to Tommy. The drama of \"Brothers\" is at the homefront, not an Afghanistanian hot zone, but Tobey Maguire is too big of a star to be kept in the filmic negative space. When Sam comes home a transformed man, for the worst, Grace doesn't know the root cause of this human alchemy, and neither should we. Sam's unpardonable act could have been taken care of with a simple flashback. \"Brothers\" is a domestic drama that's constantly interrupted by the war, but the moviegoer pardons the interruption. This remake of the 2005 Susanne Bier original(\"Brodre\") had me chained to my seat. The acting is, lights out terrific, perhaps, the best ensemble job in a major studio film this year, so far."
