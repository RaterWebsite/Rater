      "text": "I agree with \"A Movie Critic\" that The Grudge 2 is best understood in context with its American and Japanese predecessors, although in my opinion it's simply not a very good film. The Grudge 2 is indeed more similar to the original Ju-On than to The Grudge 1 in that it constantly shifts between multiple storylines and multiple characters, which leads to more spectacular fright scenes. The nature of J-horror is that it doesn't matter if one is an \"innocent\" or \"evil\" character -- anyone can end up dead. It is the utter randomness of awful deaths that make J-horror so compelling. That said, I actually liked Grudge 1 better than Ju-On because its (more) linear plotline builds both tension and history with each scene. Ju-On, to me, seemed like a pastiche of fright scenes, which may be the point, but it still doesn't do it for me. Grudge 2 is a return to Ju-On's jumpy storylines and inconsequential characters. The acting and the dialogue is worse than ever before. There is some promise of Kyako's back-story, similar to the Ring, but it fails to deliver any greater understanding because it's ridiculous and inconsequential. Basically, nothing really matters in this movie except jumping out of your seat when ghosts appear out of the shadows. That in itself has some value ... but not much."

      "text": "I thought I'd jump in here because these professional reviews pain me to read. What use does anyone have for such a technical and mechanical analysis of a film that is supposed to be fun and enjoyable. They would do better to write about an emotional reaction they had, should it even be a negative one. That said, my emotional reaction is why I love this movie. I'm sure this will upset all the people who hated this film for it's technical flaws, but I love \"The Grudge 2\" for the experience it creates...I think the girl \"Kyako\" is genius, and she scares me, and makes me afraid to turn off the lights at night. I'm 28 years old. Enough said. This film is powerful, fun, and creepy enough to be worth my 9 bucks. Reviewers, I have realized, hate horror movies. Furthermore, they are more concerned with showing how brilliantly they can write than actually giving you something useful to ponder over. Ultimately, if you liked the first Grudge film, see this one...if you didn't, don't. That's my best advice to you."

There is almost no coherent plot. There is no character development. Why should we care that these people are meeting their demise. I had to laugh when the main character goes out into a small town to find out the truth...only to learn nothing new. What a waste of time. I went with a large group of friends and we all came to the same conclusion. This movie is horrible. Two more points. Almost everyone in the audience yelled \"this movie sucked\" when it was over. I don't know the last time I saw that reaction from a movie audience PS...The trailer also reveals a major plot point...what were they thinking when they made the trailer... Go rent a much better horror movie \"The Eye\"... Tom Cruise is producing the American remake...please see the amazing Japanese version before his remake arrives at a town near you. The Grudge is a correct title...we should all have a Grudge with the studio that made this terrible movie called \"The Grudge 2\""

      "text": "The Ju On films were never about storyline, they were more about scaring the audience as much as possible. They are done in episodes, simply going from one character to another to watch their bizarre, scary deaths one after another. I was disappointed with The Grudge, because not only did it lack the suspense and horror of the Japanese original, but they tried too hard to add a plot and romance and it just ended up bogging the movie down. The Grudge 2 is more along the lines of the Japanese versions. There's less plot, and more scares. The scares themselves are also much sharper and less \"PG-13\" (In fact, they really stretch that rating here) than its predecessor. Some scenes are completely scary and really suspenseful. Yet there are lots of jumps as well. If you like the Ju On films better than you liked 2004's Grudge remake, you'll really like The Grudge 2. Fans of the first Grudge may not be as into The Grudge 2, though. Compared to the first Grudge, this one is definitely less of a \"movie.\" Somewhat worse acting, less star power, worse dialogue, less plot and less structure makes it seem more like a \"right to DVD sequel\" at times than something that was made with the same care as its predecessor. But that wasn't the case. The case was simply that they wanted to return this series to its roots of being, primarily, a fright fest. That said, though, due to the need to keep the PG-13 rating, (therefore keeping the ghosts mostly off-screen, unlike the Japanese versions, where these corpses are crawling all over the place,) it's still not as scary or suspenseful as the Japanese versions and unfortunately, the movie's plot twist at the end WILL confuse people who are not aware that the 3 stories each take place years apart from each other. (Something the movie never makes clear.) The Grudge 2 also lacks a huge climactic scene like The Grudge's stair crawl. Still, though, this was a scary movie and a step in the right direction for these remakes, if they choose to continue them. If they do, though, (and I can't stress this enough) they should really go for the R-rating because building suspense by having these ghosts fully onscreen (especially Kayoko, in all her blood-covered glory,) is more effective than simply having these ghosts just jump out and scare you."

Traditionally, however, American horror films are about blood, and jumping out of the shadows and making the audience recoil in its seats. The Grudge 2 had none of this. [***SPOILERS***] I thought watching a girl regurgitate milk into its container to be one of the scariest moments in the film I loved the original Ju-On, which showed character development, and developed sympathy towards Kayako and Toshio, instead of showing them as mindless psychopaths. The movie The Grudge 2 was utterly stupid, and trying to double the fear by having more leap-outs, and two \"grudges: appear near the end of the film. The only people who were freaked out by the movie were the 40 or so pre-teen yuppies who were giggling and \"eek!\"-ing the whole time. They were more engaging than the film I was watching. Save it for video, or not at all. If you want to be scared, watch Ju-On and its sequel."

You are SO much better than this dog feces). THE GRUDGE 2 made the first movie look like CASABLANCA. At one point a kid looks almost directly into the camera and says: \"There's something bad here.\" (Get Out! Ya think?) No truer words were ever spoken."

The sequel gives director Shimizu a chance to abridge his original 4 movie series into two films and except for a few scenes and an ending that's fright, but not right - it's pretty consistent with the original. These movies will only be as memorable as long as the phenomenon of J-horror survives, and that may have pretty well run it's course."

      "text": "This movie is the sequel to \"The Grudge\", an American remake of a Japanese horror film based on the story of a powerful haunt. The first movie is good enough to be worth it but this sequel does not have the same strength and quality. The script is an unlikely story of haunting involving teenagers and the younger sister of the first film protagonist while the curse, almost unbelievably, moves to the United States. The story simply never has the credibility or ability to get us involved, even though there are several scary moments that remind us of the strength of the first movie. Everything always sounds false and forced. Another bad thing is the poor quality of the cast, which doesn't do more than it really has to do. The direction of Takashi Shimizu is relatively acceptable but, from the moment the script was written and developed in a bad and unrealistic way, the film is irreparably damaged. It's a good movie to see if we're able to ignore the lack of logic and coherence of the story and focus on what we're watching, but its far from the first film and probably miles away from the original Japanese."
