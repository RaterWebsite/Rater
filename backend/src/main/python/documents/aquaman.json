      "text": "8.4/10 James Wan has crafted the most visually magnificent and triumphant tale of the DCU, full of heartfelt emotion and genuine fun albeit ridiculous at times. Had someone ever told me I would enjoy an Aquaman film with Jason Momoa more than any film in the DCU, I wouldn't have believed them and laughed. The truth is imho this is the most effectively executed film of the extremely polarizing DCU, and is filled with an array of epic moments throughout, as well as a fantastic portrayal of the comic story. While it might stray away from comics in certain aspects, it thrives with its own distinct identity. The attention to detail from Wan is impeccable as usual and the visuals in this are mind blowing to say the least. The world building through the diversity of colors, environments, creature designs, costume designs, and the overall perspectives are spectacular. The CGI was heavily utilized but never looked cheap or unrefined and is some of the best work I've seen. The characters are all acted well besides Black Manta's character which I thought was a laughably bad performance though maybe it was just how his character was written. Momoa did well enough and was extremely fun to watch, but Patrick Wilson stole the show with an incredible role as King Orm and added a whole different dimension to the majestic story that I did not see coming. It's clear to see why James Wan casts him so much in his great films. I also thought Willem Dafoe did a fantastic job as Vulko and it was cool to see him once again in a comic adaptation. I did think some of the dialogue and forced comedy was hit or miss at times, and bordered on ridiculous to where i laughed in absurdity. There are some really oddly placed songs in the soundtrack that also add some laughable ridiculousness. Luckily the story thrived so much with its triumphantly heartfelt core and exciting high octane action, that some of the more cheesy parts can be overlooked. It's satisfying to see that Wan took the time, effort, and heart and broke away from tired formulas of the DCU for the most part, to procure an epic original adaptation that sets up a bright future. I just hope the Black Manta character/actor will improve, because if he will be the main villain, he will have to be more convincing and slightly better written. Overall this is a fantastic film that needs to be seen in theaters to truly savor the details and grand scapes."

The plot explores well the background of the character, as the story at any time notices become predictable. It has a perfectly balanced tone that does not even saturate. The third act is ascending until it unleashes a climax full of action. Jason Momoa is very charismatic as Aquaman and imposing, makes us interested in his asomobroso trip. One of the best points of this film is the villain Orm, Patrick Wilson delivers a decent villain for the franchise, perhaps one of the best villains of this type of film in the last 6 years and surpassing all the ones seen until now. DCEU.Aquaman exploits very well all the potential it has, from the visuals to the most outstanding performances."

Best DCEU movie, and an extraordinary superhero movie! You must see it on the big screen! If it was a Marvel movie, than would be 80 points or higher!This movie is truly a masterpiece in the superhero genre, the cinematography and visuals are breathtaking, simply beautiful to look at. James Wan probably did one of the best directing job in 2018 as everything was just perfect, nailed everything perfectly, catching the heart of the characters and story and also the whole atmosphere and tone of the movie, making everything believable. Its actually really close to the New 52 comic book run that was written by Geoff Johns, it made me as a fan really happy, seeing the villains and all the culture and people done right. Making the costumes for especially Orm, Mera and Aquaman's final suit absolute true to their comic book counterpart. It was also great cast, having a well known ensemble with names like Amber Heard, Willem Defoe, Dolph Lundgren, Patrick Wilson and Nicole Kidman that all portray their characters in a accurate and great way. Jason Momoa blew me away, he's actually a believable Arthur Curry except for the long brown hair and beard. My favorite characters have to be Aquaman and Mera like they were in the graphic novel, great duo and amazing characters!Something that kept me interested at all times were the action sequences and plot, making it flow together nicely. The Sicily sequence and the final battle being my favorites, making this movie rewatchable more than the great characters and actors they have in store! It's epic and has a lot of heart, thanks to James Wan and everyone else that helped make the movie."

Did I say script was horrific, generic predictable-dialog was childish,-I could see the actors reading the script off the page, is that directors fault. They spent so much time of the CG that they didn\u2019t pay attention how horrible the script was2. CG was bad, cartoonish, very video game...not believable. I can see the green screen!!!!!!3. Poor costumes and wigs, I can tell amber is wearing a lace front wig. And under water creatures wearing s shoes!!! Yup Nichole Kidman had shoes on when she came out of the water!! And a suit that the necktie was loose!! Isn\u2019t she supposed to be from under water? What happened to blending the neckline into her skin? Just baaad. Ruined it from minute one3. Over the to sound effects, just not believable . Daggers sound like swords ...just bad3..  now Nichole Kidman was is  baaaaad Casting ! She was awful, I did not even believe her acting! The fight scene she did in the beginning is comical4. Even thought the music was cheesy!!! It had potential but it was one cheesy line after another and very predictable. Even the music was cheesy. Drove me crazy. And the ending.......ugh, couldn\u2019t watch! And...they kept it open for a second one."

That's why I take so long to do it.Aquaman is a film that feels exactly like what Batman V Superman and Justice League wanted to be. A film too big and ambitious for its own good in order to try to reach the size of what Marvel achieved with more time and in more elaborate order, but I must say that it had a little more success in trying to channel that ambition.Not only happy with almost erasing the events of Justice League, Aquaman tries to cover too much and even with the inclusion of his two most famous villains it shows how desperate the studio was to achieve something big, noisy and sufficiently full of CGI action in order to attract the masses. Let's be honest, if this film had failed at the box office, that would have been the end of the DC film universe.I will not deny that it manages to entertain, but it's devastatingly unforgettable.Jason Momoa overacts too much and the truth is that you can tell he's trying too hard. Charisma must be natural and in him it doesn't feel that way at all.Personally, this film did nothing for me.But I have to say it and just as a small note because I don't usually comment on this but Amber Heard, Jesus **** Christ!!!!"

While Wonder Women would be a better action movie than Aquaman, Aquaman does a good job while bringing elements the other films lacked. It has great and cheesy humor, brings the science fiction to the screen more than just a comic book Esq way, and it takes itself less seriously while still bringing the notion that everything is on the line in a more marvel fashion. Huge fan of Jason Momoa and thought he did a fantastic job portraying the underrated superhero and Amber Heard exceeded my expectations too. I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys superhero films and I personally was happy to pay to see it."
