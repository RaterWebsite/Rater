The real idea is that there are worse things you can do than spend time in the presence of such luminaries as Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Anthony Hopkins, David Thewlis, and Brian Cox, as they goof around with this sort of material. The first Red had the same basic idea, too. But it also had a jaunty energy and some surprising visual flair, probably courtesy of director Robert Schwentke, an underrated stylist. Now with comedy veteran Dean Parisot (Galaxy Quest, Fun with Dick and Jane) at the helm, the new one is more about the jokes. It\u2019s funnier than its predecessor, but also less human. Willis and Parker, who had some decent chemistry in the earlier film, are blander this time around. The script doesn\u2019t give them much to do with one another besides bicker; otherwise, they seem to just be along for the ride. But there are some nice touches, too. As before, Malkovich makes for excellent comic relief, and there\u2019s a mildly adorable ongoing romance between Mirren\u2019s British assassin and Brian Cox\u2019s ex-Russian secret agent. (Also, Dame Helen looks awfully fetching in camouflage.) But no movie with this much ass-kicking should feel so lifeless. Nothing in Red 2 is actively offensive, but for the most part, it\u2019s hard to really care for anything that\u2019s happening to these characters. The compositions are so drab that when the onscreen transitions come  in which the action freezes into a comic-book frame and then swishes toward whatever foreign destination our characters are headed next   the movie seems to be commenting on its own visual flatness.

All this is the director's fault, of course; this is the same guy that directed \"Galaxy Quest\" where the comedy did work because it was in the film's dna as a parody but this film is supposed to be action-drama, not a parody. And I'll call out Mary-Louise Parker for most disdainment since she showed no acting talent and couldn't even emote for what must be botoxed facial paralysis.

It was a waste of time watching this, just another formulaic action movie without any real moral or objective plot line.\r The worst part for me was seeing the supposedly \"best assassin in the world\" miss over and over, and then finally switch sides in the end. WHY WOULD THEY SWITCH SIDES? WHY WOULD THEY TRY TO KILL YOU TO BEGIN WITH IF THE MONEY WASN'T WORTH IT? They tried to explain this with the guilt trip that the main protagonist comes up with, the \"we need to save millions of lives\" routine, but is someone who kills for a living actually going to have the morality to not kill for the 20 million just to save lives?

A solid blend of action and comedic moments. While Willis was good enough in his own right Malkovich, Mirrem, Hopkins and Lee stole the show every time they were on screen. Lee was especially great, not only with his martial arts but with his comedic delivery ... which caught me off guard and was a pleasant surprise. At it's core, it is an interesting story that kept you guessing.\r The Bad: It did go a little over the top on the action a few times and watching Willis survive crashes in numerous vehicles and a deluge of bullets got old. I understand that he is supposed to be good at what he does, but he can't defy physics and is not bulletproof. Mary-Louise Parker was up and down with a few great lines but then some awkward ones that weren't really very funny.

It was a fun silly movie, with way better writing (and acting) than I expected, and several twists and turns. It was also really fun to see how much older actors, believably, could be badasses in their golden years. I mean, the oldest ones do less kungfu stuff and more intimidation or just practice their skills  like a 30th level arch-assassin.

The movie isn't meant to be taken anymore seriously than something like Under Siege, but hey both were really fun to watch."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "I found this to be much better than the first movie, which I didn't enjoy. Just like the first I find the humor to be much better than the action, so the much improved jokes are greatly appreciated.

The plot is slightly confusing, familiar, and ends up going nowhere. The action is tolerable but nothing spectacular. All in all it's a decent action flick that surpasses it's predecessor, but fails to leave a lasting impression.

Red 2 feels like phase two, a film that benefits from both a good story and some strong direction by Dean Parisot. When Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) gets dragged back into his past CIA life yet again when Marvin (John Malkovich) asks for his help. It isn't long before Frank and his girlfriend Sarah (Mary Louise Parker) are thrown back into the thick of it. Brimming with plenty of comedy, both loud and quiet, Red 2 is a fast paced action thrill ride with a good sense of self and a cast of actors who are clearly loving the experience. Willis leads a cast who have a good grasp of the inherent comedy in the films plot. Malkovich who was the highlight of the original shines yet again, mainly thanks to a costume department who dress Marvin in some of the most inventive and ridiculous outfits you can possibly imagine. A globe trotting adventure film as well as a comedy conspiracy film, all wrapped up into one excellent picture. Smartly written by Jon and Erich Hoeber, Red 2 is a wonderful treat but it does rely on crazy twists that are all too simple in their execution making for a rather dull and predictable final act that does make you laugh (one moment had the whole cinema in fits of laughter) but doesn't amaze due to the predictable conclusion. It's all good fun but it isn't quite the finished product, even if its an improvement on the first."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Red 2 continues to be the romp that began with the original Red, with the incomparable Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Mary-Louise Parker\u2014and with this second round, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Anthony Hopkins. The plot is convoluted and a little confusing, but there is a weapon of mass destruction out there called Nightshade, and the CIA wants to kill its very own Frank Moses (Willis) and his cohorts because they were vaguely associated with the secret project. The inventor of the secret bomb is a slightly senile professor named Bailey (Hopkins) who has been kept safely locked up in a sanitarium for over thirty years, Stalin-style, until he is rescued by the aging agents Moses and Victoria (Mirren). Although the ex-agents try to pretend they are retired, you can't keep a good spy down, and when called, they serve. And they serve with skill, talent, and dry humor in spite of their gray hair (or no hair) and wrinkles. They're more fun than James Bond.\r Frank Moses' best friend Marvin Boggs (Malkovich) stages his own death in the beginning but resurrects himself just in time to save his friend. Malkovich struts through the film with his signature blase attitude, his Zen-like calm, and that mesmerizing lilt in his voice. Frank Moses has already rebelled against his age by taking on a new girlfriend, Sarah Ross (Parker), who wants to be an agent just like her boyfriend Frank, but he only wants to protect Sarah from herself, for he is convinced that she's too weak and vulnerable to be a real player. Not since Diane Keaton la-dee-dahed us in Annie Hall have we seen such charming naivete and spontaneity in the archetypal role of the presumably helpless girlfriend. Parker as Sarah Ross is 49 but looks like she's 29, so she may appear to be a midlife crisis for boyfriend Frank, but she is in fact age-appropriate.\r The dynamic pack of senior spies have to face impossible obstacles, such as rescuing Bailey from the asylum for the criminally insane, which looks like a fortress, and then having to penetrate the Kremlin, which is truly a fortress. The plot would not be a comic book (the film is not trying to be overly realistic) if there were not an evil Asian contract killer (Lee Byung-hun) who has sworn to kill Moses. And then Moses's ex-girlfriend Katya (Zeta-Jones) appears, and she is a suave, sophisticated Russian KGB type who is also after Nightshade, and she teams up with her former beau Frank while swapping mild insults with his girlfriend Sarah, who is slightly threatened by Katya's charisma. \u201cShe's cute,\u201d says Katya to Moses while glancing over at Sarah. \u201cWhere did you find her...Nebraska?\u201d she asks. \u201cKansas,\u201d chirps Sarah who is listening in with interest. Katya is described as \u201cFrank Moses's kryptonite,\u201d and Zeta-Jones delivers the goods in the role of an exquisite rhymes-with-rich. Willis does a variation of his unperturbed yippee-ki-yay character from Die Hard but with a new sense of resignation and eternal patience that only a senior citizen could have. Mirren continues to play the role of an omnipotent spy-genius\u2014there is nothing she cannot do while making caustic remarks through it all. Hopkins fools us by playing a role within a role, as he pretends to be the bumbling and harmless professor.\r Although completely zany and unrealistic, the film is irresistibly beguiling because of the megawatts of charm generated by the actors. The theme is perhaps not quite as fresh as it was in the first Red, but hopefully there will be a Red 3 where the producers will work a little harder on the plot."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Somewhat entertaining but mostly very unoriginal and not funny enough. Acting is okay."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Although not as well constructed as the prequel, these senior action heroes still have gleeful somewhat appealing spy adventure. Like all the movies with collection of stars, RED 2 adds some familiar faces into the mix. Anthony Hopkins and Lee Byung-Hun are nice inclusion, they bring some novelty with nice acting and stunts. The story is far from impeccable, it's a bit rushed, contains too many half-baked plan of infiltration and relies more on firepower than the previous title. However, it is still decent and fun to watch as the cast seem to enjoy the mash, especially towards the end.\r Story revolves around the usual conspiracy, framed heroes and zealous contract killers. It passes some points with little explanations, these scenes occasionally turn silly, not in the witty parody of spy flick, but simply ridiculously mindless. Bruce Willis has decent performance, although sometimes he looks overly joking, or just sleepy, and can't be taken seriously. John Malkovich is good, he provides strange nuance as if he's funny with that little grim side tucked away. These two and Mary Louise-Parker seem to be enjoying their roles and it gives the movie a lighter tone, almost comedic even.\r Anthony Hopkins is suavely convincing, his voice exudes sophistication although he appears slightly frail from his age. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the femme fatale from the past, but she's trapped in a generic role and her rivalry with jealous main character is very silly. The martial artist Lee Byung-Hun completes the cast as it's almost mandatory to have an Asian to do all the fight stunts. Surprisingly, he has fairly amount of humor part as well, it won't be a surprise to see him more often in Hollywood movies.\r While the cast does possess weighty names, the script is rather weak. Jokes are stale, with only a few of them able to force chuckle. Screenplay also isn't executed neatly as in the first, half of it is predictably sluggish. It picks up the pace towards the end and ultimately ends up passable. More explosives and bullets are utilized, although they are dull and have less impact than they are meant to be. Aside from the occasion tussle and despite the soundtracks' fervent attempt to fire up the audience, the action is only average.\r RED 2 has some merits, it's fairly enjoyable, but it's arguably inferior to the first. It is less charming, not as clever and not an appealing case for another sequel, which is a shame since RED has potential to be a smarter version of Expendables."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "In 2010, DC Comics introduced the world to one of it's lesser known series, R.E.D. (Retired Extremely Dangerous). What I loved about that film was that it took old school action stars and put them into a modern action movie. The expectations for action movies are much higher today, no longer are they just chases, explosions, and gun fights. Today, people expect action films to have some kind of story, characters with personality, and even some humor. RED delivered all that and more and so does it sequel. Even though there are some bigger names in RED's second installment, the humor didn't play as big a role as it did previously and the story moved a lot faster. To some, this may have been a good thing, but for me, too much happened too quickly. I liked it better when we didn't know the characters or what to expect from them, when things were explained, and not just delved into. The first film made RED seem very original, but it's sequel really does play like a story that was adapted from a comic. Don't get me wrong though, while the second film doesn't compare to the first, it is still far better than some of the other action films released lately. You really can't go wrong in having an action film that stars Bruce Willis and John Malkovich, they seem to just be oblivious to the signs of aging and are as believable today as they were in their prime. Alone, this pair would have been terrific, but you add true legends of the screen like Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirran to the cast, and honestly, I don't see how any movie fan would want to miss that!

With bigger and sillier action scenes, more interesting characters and a more out there plot, if you were a fan of the first, you will enjoy this sequel."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Bottom line: I didn\u2019t expect much from Red 2 and I wasn\u2019t disappointed; it is funny at times and is, overall, a pleasant enough movie.\r I didn\u2019t see Red because I was never the biggest fan of movies where the kick is that older people are doing things typically associated with younger people. I will say that I would rather see old people in a film than children. Both groups make snarky comments but I feel like once you reach a certain age, it is fine. I was pleasantly surprised by Red 2. It\u2019s funny here and there and it isn\u2019t really trying to be anything more than a comic book movie. It isn\u2019t too stylized but it isn\u2019t too realistic. \u201cStylized,\u201d mind you, isn\u2019t inherently bad but is when executed poorly. I suppose anything could be bad but it\u2019s the difference between Kill Bill and Baytown Outlaws.\r Red 2 is about a bunch of retired CIA (MI6, KGB, etc.) agents going back into action to track down a missing Cold War super-weapon before it falls into villainous hands. I liked each of the characters. I was a little wary of Mary-Louise Parker. She teetered on annoying but she was sympathetic enough to not make me hate her.\r The humor in Red 2 is a lot like the following joke:\rTwo hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses. He doesn't seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed. The other guy whips out his phone and calls the emergency services. He gasps, \"My friend is dead! What can I do?\" The operator says \"Calm down. I can help. First, let's make sure he's dead.\" There is a silence, then a gun shot is heard. Back on the phone, the guy says \"OK, now what?\"\r There is something matter-of-fact about the violence which intertwines with the humor. \u201cIt\u2019s been months since you\u2019ve killed anyone, Frank,\u201d says Marvin (Malkovich). \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing, Marvin,\u201d Frank responds.\r One thing I thought was kinda funny was the word choice. If you recall Live Free or Die Hard using \u2018technical buzzwords\u2019 like \u201cdownload\u201d, Red 2 uses the word \u201cInternet\u201d: \u201cEver since that document was put on the Internet....\u201d and \u201cThere\u2019s no way to take down the list after it was posted on Wikileaks on the Internet.\u201d\r A driving subplot is the relationship between Willis and Louis-Parker. He is a former operative and she is a former phone operator for the Social Security Administration office. Much like the rest of the movie, it isn\u2019t tense or drawn out. It provides opportunity for quick little jokes such as the scene where John Malkovich (another retired CIA hitman) and Byung Hun Lee (the world\u2019s best hitman) give relationship advice to Bruce Willis. I can imagine how having three hitmen talk about feelings might not seem worth a sequel, but it is. Instead of adding stupid jokes Red 2 let\u2019s silly little situations speak for themselves. This is to say that Red 2 generally shows restraint, which I appreciate.\r Overall, I\u2019d recommend Red 2 for a Sunday matinee kind of thing. It could make for a cute date movie. It isn\u2019t the best movie ever in any respect but it was good enough for me to want to see the original some time."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This is a typical example why the so called \"critics\" and the official score at Metacritic sucks.This is simply a greatly entertaining movie."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This is an action packed film, much as the original ('RED') film was and so I'd categorise it as a comedy action film, as there are some scenes that are a bit ludicrous and I found myself laughing at them. I suppose it'd also be fair to call it an action parody as well.Generally there is more in the way of gun fights, moderate violence and some special effects than there is in the way of plot, which again is similar to the original film. That aside, its quite entertaining, quite comical by way of the over the top characters (in terms of their capacity to hold their own and survive all the situations their presented with) and there is some witty comedic dialogue present, so I enjoyed it. Thankfully, unlike other film sequels, this features an equally impressive cast, including Bruce Willis and Helen Mirren in the same roles as before. Bruce plays the main character, Frank Moses, who, in the beginning of the film, is revelling in his retired status (but, of course, that isn't the case for long). He plays no-nonsense Frank much as you'd expect, given that he tends to specialise in action films. Meanwhile, Helen Mirren returns as the sassy, equally no-nonsense MI6 agent Victoria. I liked her character in the first film and I did again in this sequel, in as much as I find it admirable to see an assertive and independent women who isn't afraid to stand her ground t- all of which applies to Victoria. I can't say I'd ever imagined seeing Helen Mirren in such a role before these films were made but I like it!. Other cast members include John Malkovich, Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Brian Cox and Neal McDonough. Evidently its not short of a big name or two and generally the cast do a good job of portraying their characters as somewhat hum-drum people trying to accomplish their goals and get on with their lives. It is a bit ludicrous but then thats kind of the charm of films like this.So, as I say the story is rather incredulous and it has a comic book style or tone to it, which is visually represented by some of the title shots and moments before the start of a new scebe, in which characters are depicted as cartoon-esque drawings.This film features some quite futuristic sounding music, or muzack? which helps add to the fast pace. The camera work may not appeal to anyone who suffers from motion sickness or anything similar, as scenes are frantically shot involving multiple different angles etc., to add to the sense of action. I particularly enjoyed one scene with a car chase involving two characters in an old Citroen (2CV or similar?) car across Paris. If I were to compare this film to others in general, as far as the cinematography is concerned, the first franchise to come to mind would be the Bourne films.Some of the comedy is a bit childish, such as one character 'flipping the bird' when the others become trapped while chasing him but its certainly not meant to be a film thats taken seriously - heck, the film title alone should be a clue to that (RED being an acronym, which is as follows - Retired and Extremely Dangerous).Content wise, unsurprisingly this film features some mild to moderate violence (nothing especially graphic), some strong language and drug references. Due to this, its been given a 12 certificate. I imagine this film would appeal more to adults than a younger audience, due to the cast, seeing the numerous a listers and b listers in a more exaggerated, somehow unrealistic film - ultimately having fun playing super heroes.One other thing I should perhaps mention is that there are a few (though not many) scenes which include subtitles, as characters speak in non-English languages. I think it was just in German but there may have been another, I can't remember for certain.Yes, I'd happily recommend this film. The plot is a bit thin and it isn't entirely believable but then I suppose it isn't supposed to be. Its very watchable, it features a big cast with some enjoyable performances and there is some witty and amusing dialogue, adding a comedic element to it. The camera shots may be off putting to anyone with motion sickness, or similar conditions but otherwise I reckon its well worth a watch."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Way better then the first.
