Like yeah, it's loud, stupid, and nothing makes sense. But that's what you expect by now if you've been following the series. It's simple entertainment and the film dose it's job well of doing just that. For me, it was a blast to watch and it had me smiling.I always enjoy the energy and the ridiculousness of these movies. Really pushing how far you can take this series. You've been with these characters for so long, the crew really do feel like family.Can I just say that the scenes between Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham are the highlight of the film. The back & forward insults are so silly, but amazing to watch. I heard that a possible spin-off is in the works just with those two. I actually want to see that.But if I have to be critical, I will gladly do so. Because while I had fun with the movie, but I can't bring myself to call it a good film. The acting and the line delivery from everyone is really awful (expect for Dwayne, Statham, and Tyrese). Every time the movie gets serious, it's painful to watch. I don't mind where the series is going at this point, but I kinda feel like the last one (Furious 7) would've been the perfect ending. That's just me.Overall rating: FAMILY!"

      "text": "What a mess this film was. For me, the most weakest instalment thus far. The villain was hardly memorable and her motives were for the most part, vague. There were numerous moments that didn't connect with each other well at all. The entire plot felt baseless and pulled out of nowhere a lot of the time. However, because it is Fast & Furious, it doesn't necessarily need to. There were obviously enjoyable moments behind these dumb segments. Though the action sequences as a whole weren't much of an improvement on the previous instalment, I still found them pretty good and the comedic value is still rich. Dwayne, Jason and Tyrese notably did pretty good jobs at exactly that.When it comes to this franchise, I expect great action and great comedy. It's peculiar in the sense that the action was alright and the comedy skits were very good, but the overall foundation of the film is incredibly poor to the extent that it stands out now unlike its predecessors. It just weighs everything else down. It has certainly faltered in quality. All I got from this film was the feeling of a franchise being dragged on for too long. I feel as though they should have left it after Paul Walker sadly passed away. It would have been the perfect and most appropriate swansong. Now it just feels like it's just dragging itself to the finish line in the longest way imaginable. But I'm still gonna see them - what's 2 more gonna do after I've seen this and the last 7?"

On the bad side, with the unfortunate passing of Paul Walker, Vin Diesel's character has moved to \"God\" level similar to the XXX series (which I don't like at all). Nevertheless, crazy stunts, some good funny lines, nice cars, explosions, and all around fun makes this an enjoyable ride all with the 50-60 times the word family comes around. If you are a fan, you probably have already seen this. If you hate dumb actiones movies, avoid but for a fun popcorn night, this definately works."

      "text": "\u2026 Aaaand we\u2019re back in the magical land of Vin Diesel, where the family always come first, the cup is always full, the national sport is grabbing life by the balls, and everybody and everything is at the very height of its powers, or ready to get annihilated.Thus far promoted mostly as \u201eThe Fate of the Furious\u201c, there\u2019s actually nothing ultimate or definitive about this eighth installment of loved larger-than-life action series.Just business as usual although there's nothing wrong with having some of the \"good old\" if it comes in such a spectacular package.Part 8 doesn\u2019t disappoint here. There\u2019s a lot of beauty on show \u2013 may it come in the form of people, cars, locales or physical laws defying action.Most of the setpieces are so cool that you just have to wonder at the amount of work all this must have required, done digitally or in real life \u2013 from the starting race in Cuba to the prison riot to the zombie car army to attacking the Arctic military base, or pretty much everything in-between.The Arctic part itself is so huge that it should have been saved for another movie, perhaps \u201eFF9\u201c. In current form it\u2019s like a last dish in the end of the big feast: one could enjoy it more if the belly was not so full already. Also, it could benefit from having more breathing room. The events are so cramped together and the heroes get already comically lucky here, that it loses some of desired impact.In the competence porn subgenre, \"FF\" is still one of the big ones, alongside \"Mission: Impossible\" and James Bond. I wouldn\u2019t call the new one also the new king but it\u2019s good enough to satisfy the hunger for another slice of truly over the top action that Vin Diesel seems to have dedicated his career to. Not to forget, he appeared in another episode of \u201exXx\u201c earlier this year also.The cast is cool as always. We have:* most of the main crew (Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Dwayne Johnson, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris),* expected side crew (Kurt Russell, Jason Statham, Luke Evans, Nathalie Emmanuel)* and some promising fresh faces (Charlize Theron as the main baddie, Helen Mirren, also Celestino Cornielle and Kristofer Hivju in small but very intriguing parts). I hope some of the new ones figure heavily in future sequel(s) because they have not enough room to shine here.We have also Scott \u201eson of Clint\u201c Eastwood who\u2019s bit of surprising addition, lacking the screen charm or physicality of every other star here. I hope they are not considering making him a regular.Speaking of the future, I would be excited to see the \"FF\" series seriously considering the hard mission that it has usually avoided so far, part 7 maybe excluded.Namely, the original movie is not just about grabbing life by the balls, or beautiful girls and cars. It\u2019s about staying true to family and building better life for them. It exhibits a strong sense of place and community; a world which is attractive already by itself, where the audience would like to stay in \u2013 not that often seen in movies, action or otherwise.I secretly believe that this hidden depth is a part of the reason the first \u201eFF\u201c was able to birth this mega franchise we still get to enjoy all these years later. And this is where the series should head back to.Because let\u2019s be honest, the action can\u2019t get much more spectacular and over-the-top than we\u2019ve seen so far \u2013 without doing Bollywood, at least. And the movies about having heart could actually do with having a bit more depth and heart.Two sequels have already been promised, in April 2019 and April 2021 respectively, and I am sure they will find ways to outshine (at least some of the) massive action setpieces seen so far. They always do, although it always seems kind of impossible having just finished watching the latest. But seriously, how about going back to the roots?The title abbreviation \u201eFF8\u201c reminds me of the function key F8, commonly used in desktop computers to access Windows Safe Mode. Playing it safe is exactly the movie\u2019s only downfall.The real drama is promised but ultimately missing, although the promise is great, with the central hero getting caught up with some demons and Diesel proving he has enough acting chops to play it out convincingly."

These films aren't about storyline or film craft, they are about explosions piled on top of fisticuffs with a layer of destruction derby and a sprinkling of absurdism; this latest offering delivers on all of these elements. The performances are hammy, though Theron does manage a few chilling moments, and the cinematography is the standout aspect of the film, with some brilliant sequences handled expertly. An utterly ludicrous film that revels in its own joie de vivre. 6.83/10"

The interactions between the cast members doesn't feel the same without him and it did hurt my enjoyment of the film as a whole.

The film starts out well and it has a few novel ideas but its mostly just packed out with so many special effects they end up being not special at all, car crash after car crash, explosion after explosion, after a while it all just gets boring. Most of the film is facepalm worthy, but the hacking sequences take the absurdity of the franchise to new lows.The plot is dumb as dumb can be and you can see the \"twists\" coming from a mile away. Hollywood think their audience is so thick they even spell out the plot in the simplest terms via dialogue, and flashback cutscenes, when its blatantly obvious already whats going on. The actors do a good job with the lack of script they were given and characters with the depth of a piece of paper.Switch your brain off, feel your IQ dropping by the minute its so dumb, and a few hours pass by.Apart from one original, fun, sequence near the end its all been done better before."

      "text": "If you're the type of person who watches a Fast and the Furious movie and criticizes the realism and physics of the driving, well... I don't know how you watch any movie.  The Mythbusters have made multiple specials showing how all movies get ALL of it wrong; guys don't fly back when you shoot them, cars don't blow up like that, etc.  So criticize this franchise when you're willing to criticize your beloved (insert title here).  Having said that... I felt that the series got off the rails with the last movie (7), where they tried to contain a movie about fast cars primarily to a building.  Then I saw the trailers for this sequel, and I was furious (pun not intended); the entire series is predicated upon Dom Toretto caring more about family than anything else... how are they going to pull of him betraying family?  I was worried that the series had run out of ideas, and had to resort to the cliche of having protagonist turn antagonist.  I went through scenarios in my mind, wondering what they could try to make this feasible without ruining Dom as a character.  Don't make him a cliched \"agent gone rogue\"... Jack Bauer would go roque temporarily for the greater good; that's his job, he's a secret agent.  Dom Toretto wouldn't.  He would choose family.  He always chooses family.  So I actually went to see this movie to hate it.  I was sure they'd run out of ideas, and I was going to see what stupid thing they did to put out another sequel to make more money.Boy was I wrong!  I think this might be the best film of the franchise.  The earlier films had more personal connections; loyalties, betrayals, reasons characters felt strongly about things and would die for them.  The later sequels had more and better action as the bigger budgets were allotted due to the franchises success.  This takes elements from both of those and turns it up to 11!  For the first time in a long time I had a reason to feel really strongly personally invested in the characters, in their success or failure, and not just so they pull off a heist and get more money.  Real, human personal reasons.  And after the skyscraper jumping antics of the last movie, thankfully they decided to take this film back outside... and boy did they ever!  The scale and technical execution of this film is by far the most ambitious, and quite grandiose in its execution.  Sure, it takes a little dismissal of reality, don't think too hard about the physics, but if you can do that, if you'll grant these guys the same suspension of belief you give the Avengers (and that comparison is really not far off; in this movie, the Rock is pretty much a super hero) you are in for one of the best action movies to hit theaters in a while.  There are wow moments everywhere you look, and whether they make you laugh or drop your jaw in awe, they're immensely entertaining.  I don't know why all the bad or mediocre reviews of this film.  The people suggesting it \"jumps the shark\" don't seem to understand what that phrase means.  And the \"ridiculousness\" seems to be toward the fantastical elements; these are the same people who said Dark Knight was amazing even though almost physical stunt that happened in that movie was just as ridiculous.  And a lack of plot?  That's just blatantly false.  There is a tight, well constructed action movie plot, with a twist that's quite good.  Like I said, I have no idea what they're talking about.  This is fast car, lots of explosions, over the top action for the whole family.  With characters we already love and a new reason to root for them.  Best of the series if you ask me."

The idea seems to be just keep getting bigger and bigger to ensure the entertainment continues on. For the most part it works. You get explosions, shootouts, cartoonish fisticuffs, and of course high-speed car chases and other forms of vehicular mayhem. The big set-pieces are fun, but what really is going to keep the fans happy is that once again we get to spend time with characters we've grown to love.Every character still active in the Dom family hijinks returns. Same for a few familiar villains too. This allows for a lot of great banter when they rag on each other or dole out threats. The dialog can be truly hilarious. Charlize Theron is the big new addition as the mysterious villain who is seemingly able to pull Dom over to the dark side. She's pretty cool, but some of her overly serious monologues can be a touch too boring for a movie such as this. At least her inclusion and swaying of the series lead makes for a nice new twist in terms of what gets the character motivated to take her down, even if the plot ends up following the same order of events in terms of narrative structure as the last two F&F films. It's all about fun, fast cars, and a group of people who came together to form a family. While things get dumber and more nonsensical than ever here, the series hasn't quite jumped the shark yet. If you've enjoyed the previous movies you'll enjoy this one as well. It's largely more of the same, but we get some of the biggest action scenes yet. That proves to be enough for now."

However, that doesn't mean that it wasn't completely over-the-top and ridiculous as expected, the only difference with this one being that it was taken to a whole new level of ridiculous that even I couldn't handle. The cast does a fine job of keeping it fun and light-hearted like always\u200b. On the other hand, I found Charlize Theron to be a rather weak villain with unbelievably wooden dialogue. The story, or what little of it there was, especially with these movies, wasn't very well thought out either in my opinion. Overall, it's stupid fun entertainment just like all the other installments, and the cast remains likable for the most part. But in terms of new or innovative ideas for the franchise, it comes up unbelievably short. Definitely one of the weaker entries in this franchise thus far, with only Tokyo Drift still remaining the worst."

I walked into this not expecting much, I figured this movie would likely flop the minute it was announced but I found myself pleasantly surprised by how good this was. Performances, acting-wise were more on point with Tyrese Gibson, Michelle Rodriguez and especially Jason Statham each stepping up their game for this one. Make no mistake though, Vin Diesel and The Rock make these movies and this one is no different. These movies know what they are, theyre not like the Transformers movies where Michael Bay tries to make them something that they're not. This movie is mindless fun and action, like most of its predecessors but this one also brings to the table a mich more serious element that includes morals, humor, and over the alot of over the top action."

Yes, the story is ridiculous (like everyone in the movie is a genius), but it hooked me with all the excitement. The last 45 minutes is just pure awesomeness of adrenalin rush. And Charlize Theron is just fantastic as any villain she plays. Hats off to F. Gary Gray for directing a great looking movie!"

El d\u00fao \"the Rock\" - Statham, no puede molar m\u00e1s. Y es ah\u00ed, donde reside el mayor fallo en que no salgan m\u00e1s en pantalla. Y por contrapunto, el personaje de Toretto, que ya empieza a cansar muuuuuucho. El t\u00edpico sentimentalista que se toma en serio toda la pel\u00edcula y hace que no mole nada, en ese sentido. El resto de personajes est\u00e1 en su l\u00ednea, destacando a Roman y Ludacris que sus chistes siguen funcionando como el primer d\u00eda.El gui\u00f3n no hay por donde cogerle, es malo, est\u00e1 hecho por gente muy cafre, pero es que es tan rid\u00edculo que mola, no puedes decir que es aburrido. Aunque algunas resoluciones de conflicto... mejor tom\u00e1rselo a chiste.En conclusi\u00f3n, lo mismo que los guardianes, si buscas una pel\u00edcula divertida, no pienses m\u00e1s esta es tu peli. Si te importan las cosas que ves, con esta (como con el resto de la saga, te vas a enfadar) Yo se lo que voy a ver, y por lo tanto, me encanta, y la valoro como una pel\u00edcula de entretenimiento, y pocas me entretienen m\u00e1s que esta franquicia. La doy un 9."

If you want to watch this movie with beer, some nachos, and girlfriend under your arm, its great, but if you expect some mind blowing lines,good written script and amazing acting, then get the f... out!"

      "text": "The Fast & The Furiocho (spanish pun there jeje)I will start by saying that EVERYONE that will see o want to see the movie, know EXACTLY what kind of movie it is.  DO NOT expect a very intriguing story or something very ground to the ground.  This movie is just pure fast adrenaline and over the top events one after another (it does topped the box office record on opening day btw, beating none other than the Force Awakens)And what can you expect of this movie?  Hot gals, fast beautiful cars, crazy action sequences and a good time if you are in for it.It have some good laughs and the action if very cool. The action sequences are very inventive, most likely not possible in real life but fun as hell. the fighting is great thanks to a badass jason statham and a hulking The Rock.Everybody's acting is what you could expect from the characters they are playing so it fine, they are all Special forces, street racing, rebel underground super agents that are also normal family people that just wanna have barbecue on a perfect rooftop in NY.Who doesn't want that??"

The action and comedy flows pretty well, a lot of people seem to be hurt by the fact that it is not accurate to what standards? I ask, sure it's not Louis the XVI Coachella party as promised but it's an awesome film that's quite enjoyable as long as no one lets the stick they have poke them too hard."
