Tom Holland is great and the way that he is handled in this film is spot on.  All the other cast is solid and adds depth to Parker's High School experience.  Marisa Tomei is good as Aunt May and Robert Downey Jr. is great as always as Peter's role models.  Michael Keaton is good as Vulture and they do a good job of flushing out his motivations.  I don't think we got the most impactful fight scenes we could have gotten but it was overall fine.  Overall I thought this was a great come back for the character and I'm excited to see where they take him.  A- (Isn't it stunning these are the same writers who wrote Vacation.)"

The appearances of Robert Downey felt forced just to amp up the movie a little more, the movie seemed a bit too teeny bopper for the avengers universe. they could have done without the whole high school backstory. I really had high hopes for this movie. However, I do believe that the younger fan base will enjoy this movie a bit more than the older fan base. We get it, its a younger, immature spiderman that still needs to get used to his abilities and what not. However, going a little overboard to a point where it was just plain old annoying to watch. I hate to say it, but Tobey Maguire and his many faces was less annoying to watch. They really should have stuck with Andrew Garfield."

      "text": "The enduring presence of Spiderman on the big screen over the past fifteen years presumably caused a little fatigue once news spread of the third depiction of the crime-fighting hero. However, Spiderman: Homecoming fails to induce such feelings as the exuberant Tom Holland masters the role as Peter Parker in almost every way. After seeing him briefly in Captain America: Civil War and now under the wings of Marvel Studios, the introduction of Spiderman into the ever-expanding MCU proves to be an incredibly entertaining ride.Spiderman: Homecoming is a very well directed film, as Jon Watts gives us a joyful adventure of the teenager Peter Parker who troubles to find the balance between his personal and superhero life. Still consumed by the actions he took against the likes of Captain America in Civil War, Peter Parker becomes a desperate man, hoping to join the Avengers and impress Tony Stark aka Iron Man, who acts as his mentor. It is with this mentality that he becomes entrenched into the Spiderman persona that has severe ramifications on his social life, both at home and at school. And as the nerdy and unpopular teenager, he uses his hidden persona to define his own sense of duty and morals. As seen in one of the trailers, Tony Stark chastises Peter, quoting, \"If your nothing without this suit, you shouldn't have it\". Tom Holland develops great chemistry with Robert Downey Jr in all their scenes, however, Tony Starks appearance doesn't shy away from the fact that this is a Spiderman film. This is a film that is grounded to Spiderman, and Spiderman only.His high school story was very intriguing to watch, as we meet Ned (Jacob Batalon) who aids Peter Parker as his nerdy and funny best friend, Michelle (Zendaya) as the quirky, yet the lonely student who stands in the background, and Liz (Laura Harrier), Peter's accessible love interest. With Spiderman, Peter becomes less involved with the school, causing dysfunctional relationships to occur between him and many other students. Likewise at home with Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), who we see Peter become more distant with her as his agendas begin to take over.The main villain, the Vulture, is unlike many of Marvel's villains, in that he is the most human out of all of them. He despises the rich and the powerful messing up the lives of those below them, in this case, Tony Stark and he cares deeply about his family, wanting to do everything in his power to keep them safe and happy. His backstory, seen in the opening of the film, and the effects of his actions proves that Adrian Toomes (his hidden persona) has more redeeming qualities than one might expect of a villain. Michael Keaton brilliantly plays the role, adding hidden depths rarely seen in a Superhero villain.Overall, the action was solid, yet the film serves better as a character-driven story rather than the usual action we tend to see in other Marvel movies which may disappoint some fans. However, comic book films are about the characters and Spiderman: Homecoming accomplishes that extremely well. Tom Hollands gifts us with a great performance of the crime-fighting, friendly neighborhood Spiderman, accompanied by a great villain acted superbly by Michael Keaton, and a host of secondary characters that really complete a very well written film."

      "text": "This guy doesn't behave like Spider-Man. No wisecracks. And he has no spider sense! The movie lacks nearly all of Spider-Man's supporting characters: no Gwen Stacy, no Harry Osborn, no J. Jonah Jameson, no Robbie Robertson, no Betty Brant, no Mary Jane Watson - though inexplicably there is a character named Michelle who goes by the nickname, MJ. And Aunt May is 30 years too young, not the feeble woman who fills Peter with such a sense of responsibility. Those supporting players created the dynamic that made Spider-Man interesting. Add to this all the hyperactive Tony Stark tech and this movie just isn't Spider-Man, not to this longtime reader of the comics. And the film is politically preachy. I gave it 3 stars rather than 0 for Michael Keaton's dialog with Peter Parker when Peter goes to pick up his date. That scene was the only worthwhile moment in the movie."

      "text": "For years, fans of the web-slinging character wanted to see him join the MCU, so when Sony and Marvel decided to share rights to the character, this is the result we get. A fun, colorful and energetic superhero movie that feels rather fresh. 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is one of the best \"Spider-Man\" movies in a while, just a step below 'Spider-Man 2' (2004) and 'Spider-Man' (2002). What makes this movie work is Tom Holland's young and cheeky performance we see as the teenage hero of whom we got a glimpse of when he debuted in 'Captain America: Civil War' (2016), and now here he is, leading his own battle. We see that he faces the challenge of trying to live a normal, teenage, high school life, while at the same time, coping with being a street-level superhero, especially since Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is his mentor. He waits and waits for Tony to notify him for a mission so that he can become an avenger, but time passes, and not a single ring on his phone. He lives quietly with Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), who has no idea that he is Spider-Man, and hangs out at school with his rather dimwitted friend, Ned (Jacob Batalon), who, if you saw the trailer, you'll know that he finds out that he is Spider-Man... it even happens early on in the film, so it's not really a spoiler. The movie's main villain is Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton), who becomes the \"Vulture\". Keaton is fantastic as the main villain, and is probably the most memorable Marvel villain since Loki and/or Ultron. Watching Peter living the double life of trying to be a hero and being a teenager is something we haven't seen since 'Spider-Man 2' (2004), the idea that he has to juggle and balance his life out so things could work, but nothing goes according to plan. This is something we need to see more of, as that is what his character is about. Nobody knows his identity, and he needs to remain level-headed since he's so young. Many may be concerned that Robert Downey Jr's \"Iron Man\" character is involved too much in the film, as the trailers and promotional marketing will show, all I can say without spoiling too much is that there is no reason to fear. Downey has about as much impact on this movie as Jared Leto did in 'Suicide Squad' (2016), but if you want my advice, do not watch all the trailers if you haven't already. There are some key cameos that are spoiled, and maybe on or two plot details. The cameos by other actors are funny though, if you don't see them coming. I will admit that there are too many references to the MCU, as obviously, this movie is trying to state that this is the MCU's version of Spider-Man, and not another stand-alone reboot. At times, the references can bog the movie down a little, as it seems it cannot stand on its own. I thought Zendaya's character was rather pointless as she is only in it for about a total of 10 minutes, and her character is rather bland and not so memorable. Other than that, I had a blast with this movie. I think that director Jon Watts did a capable job of crafting some really good action sequences, and that it shows that this is where the character belongs. However, with some things, you can tell that this is a product of two different studios, it's clear that producers Kevin Feige and Amy Pascal had different ideas that both tried to get in this movie. At times it worked, and then, it didn't. Go and have fun with this movie... it is the \"Spider-Man\" movie Marvel fans have been waiting for."

      "text": "A fun time, no doubt about it. To start out, I really enjoyed Michael Keaton's adaption of The Vulture, he plays the character so well and so brilliantly as he goes from psychotic madman to sympathetic father. Tom Holland was solid if not okay, thought i still prefer Andrew Garfield's adaption to his I found his performance as Peter/Spider-Man to be commendable. Nothing against Holland but with Holland's adaption we return to the wide eyed Tobey Maguire-ish days of Spider-Man as opposed to Garfield's version which can best be described as whip-smart and likably cheeky, with an undercurrent of teenage angst as well as a sense of arrogance which gave those movies a unique, restless, reckless energy and a welcome sense of danger. Holland's interpretation also feels too relying upon Tony Stark and almost feels like an Iron-Spider-Man than actual Spider-Man. Its the same sense that people take with Christain Bale and his interpretation of Batman. Bale's batman didn't feel as \"Batman\" enough to some fans, to which I agree but I got that same feeling with Holland here. Though like Bale, Holland did a fine job in the role and its not really a knock on him as much as it is a knock on the script. That being said, I did enjoy it's lighthearted tone to go along with its likable cast with Keaton, Downey Jr, Marissa Tomei and Zendaya being the standouts here. The movie is a good time nontheless, some of my main gripes with this movie is that I felt the movie was trying too hard to be something different when it didn't need to do that, it made no mention of Uncle Ben which to some can be good but Uncle Ben is an core part of what makes Peter who he is. They didn't need to show him getting shot but him going completely unacknowledged throughout the movie bothered me. With that being said, the direction is solid but the script fails it at times but the way that it undercuts some of those small, heartfelt moments for a cheap laugh just came across to me as needless. Overall grade: B"

It\u2019s been 15 years and although there were some good times more recently it\u2019s more bad than good. I guess you\u2019ve just changed so much and honestly I can\u2019t take it anymore and I\u2019d like to move on with my life. So by all means make your sequels, sell yourself to the MCU and down the line I\u2019m sure yet another reboot is on the cards but I won\u2019t be there to see it. I\u2019m done.It\u2019s not that Spiderman Homecoming is terrible and it\u2019s definitely not the worst Spiderman movie you could watch. Aside from all the high school scenes, there are some redeeming moments, most of which feature Michael Keaton. Let\u2019s face it, he makes a good villain but it\u2019s hardly a memorable performance. Tom Holland do I like you as Spiderman? No I don\u2019t. You\u2019re annoying and you have no off switch but I understand that this reinvention of the character is not aimed at me. So bring your kids to this overly long, generic Iron Man movie featuring Spiderman. It\u2019s got the action, the endless references to the Avengers but it never gripped me. The jokes were constant and too many fell flat, the story was a drag and unfocused. I was never on the edge of my seat. There was no amazing story, no soaring score, nothing that stands out. I forgot I was supposed to be watching a Spiderman movie and I was relieved when it finally ended. So relieved I didn\u2019t even stay for the two post credit scenes. Recommended for the fanboys, as for everyone else just skip it. Goodbye Spiderman."

      "text": "It was okay to good, I guess. Tom Holland was surprising for me not expecting too much of him. I like Andrew Garfield more as Spider-Man and Tobey Maguire over Andrew Garfield but Tom Holland himself did a solid job. He was a bit too young as Spider-Man for my taste but that was not the problem. Certain things in the movie felt very forced and that is never a good thing for me in games or movies, no matter the direction, whether its \"forcing to meet expectations\" or \"forcing to do something exactly different\". At times it worked, and sometimes it just felt weird in the movie. Yes, Peter is in this incarnation also a troubled teen and he has to \"find himself\" to see that HE is Spider-Man already and yet, even if he has to find that out, Spider-Man seems TOO incompetent here. Where is his spider sense? If it is in the movie then it definitely was not shown well. And overall his abilities. Or him being afraid of a certain height being reached. It should not matter if \"that is his first time\". He is this guy who should not even care about such a thing. So what if he falls? He should have no problem swinging back. Same for his strength. This is kind of touched in the end \"when he finds the strength after finding his inner Spider-Man\" but still. He seemed like an RPG Spider-Man that was on Level 1. And it is a bit weird because I know Spider-Man, even relatively unexperienced still as ridiculously good enough simply because that is what those comic heroes are. However - it was fine. Michael Keaton as Vulture was probably the best thing of the entire movie, so was Peter's AI Lady friend \"Karen\". Now here's the thing: \"MJ\" is re-introduced. Yes, I know it is said \"she is not Mary Jane\" and \"there are other people in Peter's life\", however, well ... she is still Mary Jane. She does not like her. She does not have the same name. But of course there will not be a second character named \"MJ\" introduced just so we have a literally named Mary Jane Watson with read hair as romance for Peter. We already have an \"MJ\" who is a female \"not yet but somewhat love interest\". This is really nothing but another interpretation of Mary Jane after reducing her to her nickname and \"potential romance\". The most literal way to bring in \"Mary Jane\" without bringing in Mary Jane - as that will surely not happen; it would be awkward to have two Mary Janes. I guess the point can be quite gotten. Mary Jane lives on in this character. And that is just another one of these things that \"are just different\". I am not sure how much I like this or a very young Peter, a Flash that reminds me nothing of flash or an Aunt May that gets younger and more attractive in every movie incarnation she appears but as mentioned before, it was okay nonetheless. It was entertaining and I would say with that it did what it should do. But I would definitely want one of the other two Spider-Man incarnations as part of this Marcel CU canonicity. Still great respect to all people working on this movie."

There were something about the way it was marketed that turned a lot of people off, including me. With Tony Stark taking over half of your movie poster is pretty bad and made me worried that the movie isn't going to be all that focus. And the fact this is the third reboot of the character. I don't know why Marvel always hire indie film markers to direct these type of big budget films after one or two hits. However, after seeing John Watts previous work with \"Cop Car\" and \"Clown\", I was slightly interested.Luckily, my fears didn't come true.What could have been a stale and boring, since this is the third reboot, but surprising turned out to be a breath of fresh air with the new direction it took. \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\" is more of a comedy than anything else. It took things and toned down in terms of it trying to be cinematic. I love how small the scale is. The world isn't at strike and not every superhero story needs to have a scenario where the world will literally end if the heroes don't stop it.Tom Holland (as for right now) might be the best on-screen version of Spider-Man I've ever seen. Holland performance sells the awkward and the nerdy side to Peter. He makes mistakes and only wants to do good, so he must literally become the Spider-Man. Just to be clear, it's not doing the origin again, but taking this character in a direction that I've never seen in the other adaptations.Michael Keaton as the Vulture was by far a much better villain compared to the previous ones. It also helped that Keaton performance was pretty terrific and the scene when he threatens Peter was pretty intense. Like, you understand his character and most of the time he isn't even in the Vulture suit. He's isn't out for revenge, just a businessman dealing with weapons and Spider-Man keeps getting in the way.Without spoiling anything, but there's a twist in the movie that I thought was so brilliant and the way it was executed was superb. It actually did shock me and added more conflict to Peters life. How I didn't see it coming was beyond me.The weakest elements of the film are the same with other Marvel movies, which is characters (mostly one of the Avengers) showing up for the soul purpose of setting up upcoming movies. Feels more shoehorned in than having these characters not have a presence to the story. Good thing Tony Stark and Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) have characters to them and didn't drag the film down. However it still feels shoehorned in.Just like in \"Civil War\", it isn't visual pleasing when it comes to cinematography and color.The movie was hilarious for the most part, although some humor was trying a little too hard for a laugh. I couldn't take the movie serious when it needed it to be.Overall Rating: While \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\" is missing the heart and soul of the Raimi films, but stands on it's own as a fresh start. The writing was great, the performances from everyone was great, and did things that actually surprised me."

Tom Holland makes the character even more likeable than Tobey maguire and Andrew Garfield, but that doesn\u00b4t compensates that the movie has its flaws. First, the movie has action scenes, of course is a superheroe movie so it has to have action scenes, but this ones (except of one in the climax of the movie) are forgettable. They should have been like two or three and be awsome and unforgettable, that the movie be identify with that action scene, to be the best moments of the movie, but the best moments are with Peter Parker being a normal kid, and have teen issues. Peter\u00b4s friend is a good character, it makes you laugh for the way the character is, not because suddenly it has to be funny, is the essence of the character. Also Aunt May and Michelle are funny in the same way as Peter\u00b4s friend. The movie has great jokes but, as in all of Marvel movies, it has some moments when it wasn\u00b4t nessesary. Michael Keaton is great in this movie, his villan is understandable, but i wish i could have seen more of him. In the end, this new spiderman movie is entertaining, funny and charming at times, but it\u00b4s not the best of the character movies (the best is 2002 spiderman 2) but you could have a great time. If you\u00b4re a true Marvel and comic fan you have to stay to the post-credicts scenes, if you just like this movies but not loved them at an insane level or just want to have a good time don\u00b4t stay."

Disons le tout de suite, ce nouveau reboot de la franchise du tisseur de toile plaira aux adolescents, aux fans de l'araign\u00e9e au cin\u00e9ma et en dessin anim\u00e9... mais pas aux fans des comics et fans hardcore. L'univers n'est pas respect\u00e9 et cela peut choquer certains fans de la premi\u00e8re heure.Peter Parker y apparait comme un adolescent en seconde ann\u00e9e de lyc\u00e9e, accro \u00e0 la plus belle fille de l'\u00e9cole, et tortur\u00e9 entre son envie de faire ses preuves \u00e0 son mentor Tony Stark, et son envie de reconnaissance. Ce qui est cens\u00e9 \u00eatre une pr\u00e9sentation du personnage dans un film lambda s'\u00e9tale dans un film long de 2h14. C'est long, tr\u00e8s long pour un teenage movie.Le costume est un peu trop \"Starkis\u00e9\" avec son HUD et son intelligence artificielle, trop de gadgets pour \u00eatre un vrai Spidey \u00e0 mon gout. Le Vautour quand \u00e0 lui est plut\u00f4t original, avec des ailes volantes assez ing\u00e9nieuses qui, il faut l'avouer, \u00e9taient un peu obligatoire pour rendre le personnage cr\u00e9dible \u00e0 notre \u00e9poque, rappelons que \"Vulture\" est \u00e0 l'origine un retrait\u00e9 chauve en body vert avec de la fourrure autour du cou et des ailes m\u00e9talliques. Shocker apparait d\u00e9pourvu de costume et cantonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la place de second villain, tout comme Scorpion que l'on voit quelques secondes sous les traits du talentueux Michael Mando (Le m\u00e9chant Vaas de Far Cry 3 pour les fans du FPS).Certains personnages secondaires font tache comme Flash Thompson qui apparait comme un fils \u00e0 papa blind\u00e9 plut\u00f4t qu'un sportif \u00e9cervel\u00e9 (on voit mal Tony Revolori devenir Venom par la suite). De m\u00eame pour tante May qui apparait comme une quinqua-cougar, loin de la grand-m\u00e8re d\u00e9pendante de Peter Parker. Tony Stark fait juste le raccord entre le MCU et Homecoming. Les cam\u00e9os sont plut\u00f4t sympathiques avec l'habituel Stan Lee, Captain America et une Pepper Potts qui serait apparemment de retour avec Tony Stark (Le couple \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 \u00eatre s\u00e9par\u00e9 dans Captain America: Civil War).C\u00f4t\u00e9 effet visuel, la qualit\u00e9 film est irr\u00e9prochable mis \u00e0 part quelques sc\u00e8nes un peu fouillis notamment la sc\u00e8ne finale (no spoil). Les effets sp\u00e9ciaux sont assez impressionnants et collent bien \u00e0 l'univers.Pour conclure, Spider-Man: Homecoming est un bon film d'\u00e9t\u00e9, amusant et rafraichissant mais il n'arrive pas aux chevilles des sagas de Sam Raimi et de Marc Webb. Homecoming est une vision adolescente d'un h\u00e9ros que les fans du comic-book ne reconnaitront pas. Le film est clairement destin\u00e9 \u00e0 un jeune public. Coup de chapeau sp\u00e9cial \u00e0 la sc\u00e8ne post-g\u00e9n\u00e9rique qui est tout simplement \u00e9pique."

However I believe this film is highly overrated and is not worthy of 90+ percent on Rotten Tomatoes due to the fact that it is just the same basic hero Vs villain as it is in every Spider-Man film. The high school parts of this film were very entertaining though and is not a huge disappointment."

Even if this isn't your favorite Spider-Man movie you can deny that it is still a really fun and entertaining movie and by no means deserves a 0. It has great action, comedy, story, and tie-ins to the MCU. The introduction of the superhero clean up organization, Damage Control, was also great. It finally explains who is responsible for cleaning up after all these amazing superhero fights and where all of the debris goes. Overall I had an awesome time at the theater watching this and so did everyone I went with. I highly recommend."

Tom Holland does an extremely good job at portraying the comical and nerdy side of Peter Parker. The movie has a way of making you feel as if your discovering Spiderman all of again due to his new suit and gadgets, friends, and also his placement in this new universe. If you're one of those people pissed off that Tony Stark is in the movie and afraid that hell take the shine away from Spiderman, don't. Stark makes brief but necessary appearances. He's mostly like a guru to Peter. Michael Keaton brings a humanity to the vulture which makes him a more complex character. And big praise to Ned and Michelle (played by Zendaya and Jacob Batalon) who provides most of the movie unexpected comical relief."

This reboot does not even mind the character's identity, it's no longer necessary.

Gone are many of the trademark characteristics that make spider-man interesting, like his trademark sarcasm, the personality contrasts between Peter and his alter ego, and his overriding sense of purpose based on the murder of his uncle.  Instead we get goofy over-earnestness, no interesting character conflicts, and a single-minded drive to become an Avenger.  Really?  This combination for me at least just didn't work."

It's an uninspired, juvenile, scattered, weakly plotted, unsuccessful attempt at humor, typical way over-the-top action, annoyingly pc mess.  The Peter Parker character was always supposed to be a teen.  Tobey Maguire, the man boy, was just right to walk the line between that and also be believable and worthy as a superhero.  The new actor is young and underwhelming, and the title should be \"Spider-Boy\". It's so very stale of Marvel to be relying on the same computerized suit shtick as Iron Man not to mention Downey Jr. yet again playing that character in a movie falsely titled Spider-Man whatever.  And contrary to jackass opinion it's not so clever tying all these superheroes together and Marvel has become sickeningly contrived bending over backwards to do so with any ties to reality and plausibility increasingly disregarded.  Silly s---!"
