      "text": "I see the third movie as improvement and the best sequel in the franchise. Almost everyone from the first movie returns together with the newcomers from the sequel. It is an enjoyable experience full of great humor with the charming cast that fully delivers. The story starts with budget cuts by the state government. Because they wont afford 2 different police academy's anymore they want to close one. This will be done via competition. An impartial committee will evaluate both academies simultaneously and declare the winner. Commandant Lassard calls back his best recruits to help him to win the competition by training the recruits. This is the start of a humorous attack on your risible muscles. The story is pretty good and also realistic. So much budget was cut for the police in real life that they are barely functional (Valid for a lot of countries not only the USA). Back to the movie. What makes it interesting is that the other academy's leader is Ernie Mauser who worked his way up there from Police Academy 2. He is far better prepared as it seems the lowered standards for recruits only apply to the other academy's city (This was the beginning plot point of the first movie). He only took the best recruits. Of cause he is supported by his right hand man Carl Proctor. I fell full nostalgia at writing this. It has great humor throughout the whole movie. Again the use of stereotypes, pranks, word puns, parody and charming quirky characters work so well. We got the team back in action with Steve Guttenberg as Carey Mahoney, David Graf as Eugene Tackleberry, Michael Winslow as Larvell Jones, Bubba Smith as Moses Hightower, Marion Ramsey as Laverne Hooks and Bruce Mahler as Douglas Fackler. Leslie Easterbrook returns as Debbie Callahan and George Gaynes get a bigger role as Eric Lassard. These are an awesome cast and were iconic for the time. The new recruits are good too. We got the return of characters from Police Academy 2. Zed McGlunk played by Bobcat Goldwait joins the academy. He is accompanied by Carl Sweetchuck played by Tim Kazurinsky. These 2 are a great addition. New are Brian Tochi as Tomoko Nogato and Debralee Scott as Violet Fackler (Yes, she is Douglas wife). Like I already said for the antagonist we got Art Metrano as Ernie Mauser and Lance Kinsey as Carl proctor. Both are so enjoyable. The cast is the strength of the movie as they enhance the humor and whole experience. I give here my nostalgia warning as the franchise is full of childhood memories.  However I think it is still a good comedy for its time and an improvement from Police Academy 2. Overall I say this is the best sequel in the franchise. Non of the following movies reaches this level again."
