Curse of Chucky is a soft reboot of the franchise, Bringing Chucky back to his roots with a revamped look. And with a solid supporting cast helping along the way, Curse of Chucky reminds us all of why we loved the franchise (and Chucky) so much.

After back to back disappointing sequels, this part revived the franchise. It is totally dark, horror, slasher movie for which this franchise is known. This movie didn't contain unnecessary humour like last three parts.Movie is properly made. The old concept is revived beautifully. There are plenty of shocks and scares, pretty good acting and lots of violence. The direction and editing work is done beautifully. The pacing is so much good that you might not know when the movie is over.Overall, this movie is treat for horror and Child's Play fans. You are gonna love it, for sure."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "After her mother's mysterious death, Nica begins to suspect that the talking, red-haired doll her visiting niece has been playing with may be the key to recent bloodshed and chaos.
