      "rating": "7",
      "text": "All Saints pushes itself a little too hard to make people actually love it, but they, at least, have done things correctly even if the pressure to making people love the film couldn't work. It makes up what seems to be an impressing film and that's what it is actually."

      "rating": "4",
      "text": "All of the acting is good, I love John Corbett, and I was educated about and saddened by the suffering of the Karen people. Unfortunately the ending is so depressing that I believe that this movie should not have been made about this situation."
