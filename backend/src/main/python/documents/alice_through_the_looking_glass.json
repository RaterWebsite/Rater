The film's screenplay is great, the cast is more committed, and the visual effects are more alive and less monotonous. The film is an inspiring work, however, for a released six years later sequence, there are many details that may go unnoticed if you do not remember Alice in Wonderland.\r The farewell Alice was fast and made me want more. I managed to hold on to the story even if not a fan, just hope it's not a failure at the box office."

Alice Through the Looking Glass deliveries a rich story, which may look silly at first, but it represents the impossible, which is a great subject of the film. The characters are richer than in the original and the visuals are different, but still equally appealing. The story is a symbolism for a lot of things, which is one of the greatest things of the movie. It talks indirectly about sexism, depression and most important: it has a message, it makes you think and it makes you believe, just like every fairytale should be. Incredible, you should definitely watch and think deeply of the meaning this movie has. Also great messages about family and dreams. Different from the first one, but still gorgeous."

Perhaps the characters could have explored their roles more to make it interesting and different. I am mostly impressed with Alice in this movie, Mia Wasikowska has greatly improved in her acting.

Some incredible acting takes place in this movie, all except for Johnny Depp's portrayal of the Mad Hatter, which is absolutely ear wrenching and makes every second of this movie worse. Director James Bobin essentially takes his formula he used on The Muppets: Most Wanted and rehashes it into an absolute snore fest from beginning to end."

      "text": "This movie really surprised me, especially because I didn't really like the first one. Visually this movie is a real treat. I enjoyed the lighthearted performances, especially Mia Wasikowska as the plucky Alice, and of course I fell hard for the visual effects, Dan Hennah's production design, and Colleen Atwood's costume designs. Sadly, all the world-building that was set up in the first film took forever to manifest into a sequel, and so when we get answers to certain questions posed by the first film as well as the Caroll lore, they don't feel revelatory so much as just \"oh, so that's why such-and-such\".\r Still, I think the wait was worth it. This time around, it actually feels like there's a heart beating at the center of all the eye candy. Last time, the story was so straightforward and predictable the visuals were the only thing holding the film together. Now, the themes are more clearly presented and Alice's adventure in Underland is more of an inner journey. Underneath all the shiny gloss, this movie actually has strong personal growth messages and deals with difficult topics such as loss and acceptance. As someone who has lost someone precious recently, at the end of the film I came out feeling inspired.\r The filmmakers tap into both the darkness and the lightheartedness of Carroll's world in broad strokes, even if they don't really get or even attempt to do justice to the deeper social allegories. Linda Woolverton's script is more blunt and brute force than it is subversive, but the film's feminist touches are thankfully not as ham-fisted as they were in the first film. Wasikowska is wonderful, Depp is... well, Depp, Hathaway is pleasingly fairy-like and subdued, and Carter continues to chew scenery. But the real MVP here is Sasha Baron Cohen, whose portrayal of Time is an obvious highlight.\r Little bits and pieces of Carrollian lore are much appreciated. Humpty Dumpty as well as the large talking chess pieces make a brief appearance, and the fish and frog people are more prominent. Some of Carroll's trademark words and phrases appear especially early on, but the world-building doesn't get too in-depth beyond that. We see the origin of the rivalry between the White Queen and the Red Queen, as well as the reason why it's always one minute to teatime at the Mad Hatter's table when Alice first arrives in Underland.\r I can see why this film might not cast its spell on everyone because it's so fast-paced and often feels like a movie for kids rather than for those well-versed in this universe. But if you're on the fence, you may end up liking or even loving it! There's more to the story and themes than what's just on the surface. I wasn't at all disappointed and will watch this again in the future."

      "text": "\"Alice Through the Looking Glass\" Is Shamelessly Worse Than Its Predecessor\r \"Alice in Wonderland\" directed by Tim Burton was a flawless success at the box office in 2010, and with just reasons, the colorful and gothic style of the team managed to give them two Academy Awards (for Art Direction and Costume Design) . Lewis Carroll's classics have been adapted to the big screen eleven times, and apparently it is feasible creation of other few. The scarcity of the sequel is Burton, his absence is irrefutable and although works as executive producer, his imagination and taste cries out for the reins of the film. This time, James Bobin (The Muppets) is director, his vision is broad and great-looking, but comparisons with Burton make presence on each frame evidenced. It seems that Disney forgets that it is better win a victory that a failure because of the ambition.\r From a screenplay written by Linda Woolverton, adapted to the books of Lewis Carroll, \"Alice Through the Looking Glass\" presents to an Alice (Mia Wasikowska) a little more older - really - returning of offshore after three years, preserving the illusion of return to sea. But her hopes are frustrated when her former aspiring boyfriend, Hamish (obnoxious and pretentious played by Leo Bill) takes over the boat her father and her house, inciting her to sell the important boat, stay with the house and with a humiliating and discriminatory work. Alice's problems do not stop there, the blue caterpillar (Alan Rickman, deceased and respected actor) visits her to seduce her to resolve certain matters of her interest in the Wonderland.\rAfter an characteristic entrance of the Carroll books, Alice faces a terrible - and stupid, excuse the expression - news, her friend, the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) is slowly dying. The only solution to restore the vitality of the eccentric young is go back in time and help to recover his family apparently dead, experiencing millions of adventures and eccentricities, accompanied by spectacular landscapes and performances for nothing unpleasant. A small sub-plot is seen to involved in the story of Alice, the truth behind the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and her sister, the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), an interesting addition to the footage.\r The story is one of the fundamental obstacles, lack of a strong and wide idea, makes that the 113 minutes of duration becomes tedious, stressful and the worst soporific, making viewers to cover their mouths, but not of amazement, of boredom. It seemed as if Disney had chosen to adapt the drafts of the wastepaper basket of Carroll, yeah, they wanted that Hatter had importance in the plot, but the magic disappeared. A work of such magnitude should be edited precisely, but this time, they exaggerated.\r Fantasy and adventure sequences are indeed impressive, accompanied by an exaggerated, but required use of visual effects, minor or equivalent to the of its predecessor. However, the lush visual effects aren't the sufficiently skilled to hide a slow pace, an inconsistent script and a pale and slight story.\r Characters are distorted and dispel - some - of its strict behavior in books, however, Alice, Mad Hatter and the Red Queen steal all eyes. I'm in total disagreement that the role played by Mia Wasikowska is uniform, awkward and boring, not alluding to books and hampering adaptation, I believe that she is the precise woman for the role and if at some point has failed is the fault of the scriptwriters. Our  blue caterpillar performed by professional and king of the acting ,Alan Rickman, was spectacular, serene and substantial, worthy of a so complete and amazing career of a man and an actor who will always be in the heart of the world, rest in peace, Alan.\r This is the first time that Disney surprises, and not in the way that everyone thinks. With a clear influence of female discrimination in Hollywood and the capacity to decide, Bobin and Woolverton had to leave their idea, just like that, an idea. Slow, lacking of the energy, palpitating continuity and charisma of its predecessor, \"Alice Through the Looking Glass\" offers a visually majestic spectacle, however, they confused the audience with babies, we are not stupid, so many colors and singularities lack narrative imagination, I think that the 'Wonder' disappeared."

      "text": "After the failings of Burton's rendition of Wonderland I was going into this film expecting to hate it. However I was surprised that it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. There are some notable improvements over the original film for example Wonderland is actually bright and colorful as opposed to the previous film with a dull color palate. The lead actress actually tries to stay invested this time and gives an attempt to give an emotional performance. Sacha Baron Coen pays as Time and he is fun to watch since he is aware that he is in a mediocre film and decides to just do whatever he wanted with his performance. The same can be applied to Helen Bahm Carter as well. Unfortunately the main problem with the first film is still present in this one. Said problem is that the script tries to add logic to a source material that is supposed to be the absence of logic. When they try to add logic to it, the problems with the film start to show. The time travel was easy to follow but it costed the characterization of the Red Queen since it was reveled that she became a mad tyrant after loosing the crown to her sister. This misses the point of the original source material since the appeal of the character is that she is really a child an adult's body and as a critique on the monarchy of Britain, In this case though the film tries to give her a tragic backstory but it falls flat since it was also revlead that she was responsible for kidnapping the Mad Matter's family and burned his village down. It is considered difficult to sympathize with her since she is responsible for so much death just because of a simple sibling rivalry. The Chesire Cat lost his charm even more when it shows that he is a child hood friend of the Mad Hatter because he was always the trickster character. by giving him an allegiance to his friends it ruins the mystery of the original character. There is a noticeable emphasis on the Mad Hatter due to the fact that he is played by Johnny Depp and is the loner which is present in a lot of Burton's films. Burton may not have directed this film but it does have his blue prints around it. It tries to be dark but it doesn't go far enough like it's predecessor. There is a scene with Alice being in an Asylum which doesn't really go anywhere after Alice escapes making the whole subplot pointless. To the film's credit it tries to have a moral and an admirable one at that which is that time does take away but it also gives and people should value what it gives. The fact that Alice wanted to give up her ship to help her mother get out of dept would have signified her finally letting go of her past but the lesson wasn't ;earned though because her mother rips the contract anyway. In conclusion this film would have been better if was an original family film if it didn't have the likeness of the Lewis Carrol novels."

But, it has cringe-worthy time puns that make no sense, annnoying side characters, a hateable villan ( Red Queen) and more. It isnt bad, but its not good either. I give Alice Through The looking Glass a 6/10"

While I know that movies never follow the book exactly, this movie seemed to be created by sombody who did not even read the book. While the movie was o.k. I belive that they should have given it a title that better fits the movie."

      "text": "This whimsical sequel is rather boring and the plot is full of holes. It is rather bland but if you loved the first one you will like this one.  Johnny Depp reprises his role as The Mad Hatter except this time it is stupider and he isn't really ever happy.  He isn't happy because he found a piece of his hat that was ruined and he decided that  because of finding a small piece of his hat that he wanted his family back.  Alice somehow does not agree and then when the Hatter becomes upset she agrees.  In order to get his family back Alice must defeat Time played by Sacha Baron Cohen.  Time is the best part of the movie and he is still pretty annoying.  Alan Rickman reprises his role so since he's dead this may make you want to see the movie.\rOverall, a bland/boring film not directed by Tim Burton."
