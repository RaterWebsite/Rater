I love Olivia Wilde, especially her performance in Drinking Buddies.  I was really hopeful about her directorial debut.  This comedy is not funny.  There is no timing, no flow.  The base premise, that these nerds want to party when they realize everyone else in their high school also got into amazing colleges while partying and screwing off, is silly, of course.  But the flimsiness of it, especially because of no follow up, was sad.  We kept waiting to laugh, but every performance was so stilted and every character so stereotyped (the over-the-top, effeminate gay theater boys, come on), we chuckled mildly once.  After an hour, we walked out.  We don't do that.  It also made me think it may be a generational thing.  But I really don't think so. We love these coming-of-age stories, from Superbad, American Pie, Clueless, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, even American Graffiti.

El problema es que el gui\u00f3n asume que \"pertenecer\" es diversi\u00f3n, alegr\u00eda y festejo, y lanza a sus actrices a una aventura que, en vez de disfrutar, las convierte en pat\u00e9ticos intentos de retroceder a una actitud primitiva. Asimismo promueve la actitud del exceso, el ceder a los impulsos sexuales y mentales, la desconfianza social y \"soluciona\" la idea de \"comprar amigos\" con romance. Aunque hay una secuencia de animaci\u00f3n (que se puede quitar sin da\u00f1o alguno), la escena que le da valor a la pel\u00edcula (e, ir\u00f3nicamente, se enmudece) es un conflicto verbal que muestra el talento actoral de las protagonistas.A pesar de que el film tiene la oportunidad de exponer un drama socio-cultural, prefiere optar por el camino c\u00f3mico e inconsciente de su misma cultura. \"Booksmart\" es peligrosa y me causa pavor imaginar cuantos j\u00f3venes pueden verla y querer crecer igualmente solo porque es \"cool\". No lo es, hay diferentes tipos de diversi\u00f3n, y entregarse a los impulsos es la forma m\u00e1s irresponsable de vivir.-The youth that the actress and director Olivia Wilde shows in \"Booksmart\" is full of ignorant privileges and celebrates the most incorrect values that the youth needs to overcome and change. The Pop culture has produced films about young rebellion, energy, and wildness that, along with films like \"Superbad\" (2007) and \"Project X\" (2012), just reinforces the american stereotype that youthhood has won: a society of waste and useless, irresponsible consumerism.  Amy and Molly (Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein), are about to graduate from high school when they realize how foolish they were by studying and not going out to parties at the same time, therefore they decide to make their last night of high school, the most adventurous and crazy. It is not that hard to identify yourself with this youth, we all have been young and, at least a little, have felt the privileges of belonging and the fears of being an outcast. The problem is that the script assumes that \"belonging\" is fun, joy, and celebration, and throws their cast to an adventure that, instead of enjoying, it makes of them pathetic attempts of behaving in a primitive way. Likewise, it promotes excess behavior, giving in to the sexual and mental impulses, the social distrust and \"resolves\" the idea of \"buying friends\" with romance. Even though there\u2019s an animation sequence (that can be taken out with no harm), the scene that gives some value to the movie (and, ironically, is muted) is a verbal conflict that shows the acting talent of the main cast. Despite the film has the opportunity of exposing a social-cultural drama, it prefers to take the comical and unconscious path of the same culture. \"Booksmart\" is dangerous and it makes me dread to imagine how many young people can see this and would want to grow up just like that because it's \"cool\". It's not, there are different types of fun and giving in to the impulses is the most irresponsible way of living."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "It is like a bland version of Superbad.

But other than that, It's neither funny nor original. I have seen quite few films with this theme, or that are classified under this sub-genre (I haven't even seen Superbad), but I already found everything here quite familiar. The plot itself is clich\u00e9d, insipid, formulaic, and oversimplified. And you can clearly notice that at every single turning point in the story. And there are a lot in the second half, for it's very overstuffed, messy, and muddled. And that, of course, caused a lot of tonal imbalances.I'm really frustrated because I thought I would see something like Lady Bird, Greta Gerwig's fantastic and highly auspicious directorial debut. But Booksmart seems to think it is much smarter then it actually is. I have to give Olivia Wilde points for making such an energetic and colorful film, though. Also, these flashes of wit I've mentioned above are all due to Wilde's direction. I do think she has a quite promising directorial career.(5.5/10)"}, {"rating": "0", "text": "This is truly an awful film. I can only imagine the writers concocting this story with one message in mind: make these characters quirky and also one dimensional. 'Quirky' is all they have going for them which makes them boring. Sure, there are messages of female empowerment yet it does nothing to propel a meaningful story. Tell a story. Come on. Here, each character broadcasts an over the top persona that is difficult to relate to. Initially, I liked that the one girl had a crush on a skater girl. Yet, we know nothing about her within the first forty minutes of the film. All we know of these highly educated outsiders is they are outsiders. That's it. Each scene only fosters a certain stereotype that is exagerated to the point of dullness. Slut girl acts like a slut. Dumb guy acts dumb. Rich kid acts rich. And the two friends are just two friends who find out the people they looked down on are actually goinst to prestigious schools. Wow, twist... So what is their motivation? To party. That's it? That's it. The whole wants vs. needs of screenplay writing 101 does not even happen here. They want to prove to people they don't care about that they can party as well. I mean, if the beginning of the film sets these two up as individuals who could care less about what others think of them, why would this matter? Their only character trait is they are indifferent to the opinions of others. And that is shattered because the movie needs to happen. These are screenplay ideas running around as supposed characters and nothing else. And on their journey they meet other purposelessy strange characters. There have been wonderful female friendship films with fleshed-out, wonderful and quirky characters. Think Romy and Michele's High School Reunion. If you want female empowerment and self-awareness, look no further than the seminal Thelma and Louise. I have loved three seasons of Glow on Netflix mainly because the writers care to build on the dynamics and relationship of the characters. But I could not make it through this forced and over the top film. I didn't laugh. I rolled my eyes as it felt like this film had the concept of something interesting and fun without actually following through on it."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Booksmart tries it's best to be this generation's Fast Times and Ridgemont High or Super Bad, but ultimately fails in it's execution."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "I really looked forward to seeing this movie and really wanted to love it.

That is, until the third act, when we learn everybody's really a nice person. Oh, and it ends at an airport, which I've never seen a movie do before.

Well in a way it is because she chose that script to debut as a director but the rest is the fault of the writers because they were the ones who implemented this story but analyzing it, you will realize that you're practically watching the same film. The only difference is that the main characters in this case are women and they don't have a third character to finish the jokes like Fogell.Although what interested the guys in Superbad was to get laid, the only difference with these girls is that they try to have fun considering that they apparently think they wasted their time in high school studying to the fullest trying to enter a good college.Because apparently studying hard and not living at parties with drugs and alcohol is only a crime of the nerds. What a cliche isn't?But it doesn't stop there. Once the story makes clear where is going, the path that follows is saturated with clich\u00e9s until the ending.I don't understand in what way anyone would tell me this is a fresh film, that it reinvents the genre, that it brings something new to the table because I didn't see it anywhere.Does that mean it's a bad film? Actually bad wouldn't be the word I would chose but irrelevant.I cannot deny in any way that more stories are needed with female characters, which obviously need more films directed by women.That the voices of these women should be delivering strong stories and in general terms Booksmart has some of those things I mention.The director is a woman, the main characters and screenwriters too and I applauded they have that opportunity and that they have the forum for people to see and hear their work but don't disguise the importance of that proposal with the results delivered because I personally think that Booksmart has nothing original or new and that isn't necessarily a bad thing because how many film exists that repeat thematics?

The best high school film hands down and I\u2019m a 34 yr old woman."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "In 2007, a little coming of age-high school comedy, with a very modest budget of $20 million took the coming of age, modern high-school comedy canon by storm, and has yet to be trumped in over a decade. That little movie that could was Superbad, a film that was written by real-life best friend Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who, went on to becoming two of the most successful and prominent comedy writers of our generation. Generating real-life stories based on what happened to them, including the infamous period-blood dance scene, the cocaine-karaoke scene and other incredibly funny scenarios that we thought could ever happen in a million years, the two writers have a knack of garnering insatiable laughs with well-received, cortically and commercially successful films. Luckily for us, Superbad was a film that starred two breakout stars in Michael Cera and Jonah Hill, who would go on to becoming staples in the comedy world as well as the Seth Rogen\u2019s comedy empire. But like all good things in this world, change is upon us. With the recent influx of female voices being heard and stories being told, we fast forward twelve years, and finally have our very own, female-centric Superbad with Booksmart. And as if destiny would have it, ironically enough, this kick-ass female story of missed opportunities and revelations delivers endless laughs, sometimes cries and funny enough, stars Jonah Hill\u2019s little sister Beanie Feldstein. How\u2019s that for a coincidence?Directed by OIivia Wilde; yup, the actress of Tron, her and Drinking Buddies tackles directing duties and nails her debut feature film with so much heart, love and authenticity that Booksmart feels like a veteran comedy with constant one/two punch laughs, confidence and endless emotion. Stylistically relevant, adapting much of the real-life comedy that made the Rogen/Apatow comedies of the 2000s so successful, Wilde directs a script that has been in development for over a decade to reflect so many of the many truths of high-school youth today. Making the film contemporary with scenes including Uber, social media and of course implementing characters that aren\u2019t only heterosexual, allows the film\u2019s fresh vibes to come naturally off the screen, even if Amy and Molly\u2019s (Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein) cool personalities don\u2019t.Booksmart is a movie that we have been waiting for, for a long time. The film\u2019s hook may be a completely authentic female take on the high school experience, produced by Annapurna Pictures, headed by Megan Ellison, directed by a woman, starring two promising young female actresses, written entirely by women and edited by a woman, but I can assure you, these highly feminine factors are not the only reason to visit your multiplex this summer. Aside from being a female-centric comedy, after everything is said and done, it is a comedy, and I am here to attest to the fact that, it is really funny. Aside from the star-making performances of actresses Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever, writers Susanna Fogel, Emily Halpern, Sarah Haskins and Katie Silberman, deliver quippy, snappy and hilarious dialogue that highlights the very different, yet strikingly similar high school personalities of their characters, without making them caricatures of figures we have come to expect from the high school comedy genre. Each character depicted in Booksmart are culminations of so many different personalities; mixing gender, sexuality, religions, class and cultures into real life characters that not only become relatable, but also become memorable. Booksmart highlights that jocks JUST aren\u2019t jocks, and the gay students JUST aren\u2019t gay. Every person depicted in the film is a version of someone we all knew or currently know in real life.Although there is an array of comedy from supporting characters, the majority of the laughs stems from the bond and chemistry between our two amazing leads. While Dever and Feldstein bring true laughs to their characters Amy and Molly, unfortunately, both Amy and Molly feel like they have been missing out on their high school shenanigans. So, on the last day of high school before their graduation, Amy and Molly decide to go for it, and indulge in all the craziness that is high school, in one night. As expected, hilarity, craziness and debauchery ensues, and the two bets friends find themselves in very different places by the end of the night.Booksmart is easily the funniest and smartest comedy of 2019.Raunchy and totally inappropriate in so many scenes, Wilde\u2019s Booksmart is a winning combination of American expectations for comedy films with many social expectations and commentary. Even though Amy and Molly got into their desired schools, working and studying their butts off for the whole course of high school, when Molly finds out that the slutty cheerleader archetype, the stoner and the jock all got into the same schools, becomes a little bit of a bittersweet realization."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Best movie I have seen in years.
