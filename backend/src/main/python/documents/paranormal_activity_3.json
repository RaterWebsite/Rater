      "text": "The movie started off pretty good, with a clip somewhat, but not quite, \"explaining\" the break in at Kristie's house that prompted them to install the security cams that recorded the majority of the events in PA2 (even though in PA2 they claim that the only thing stolen was a necklace, and in this one it was the old VHS tapes from when the girls were little that were the only things missing). Then the movie switches to the clips from the \"missing tapes\" without any explanation about where the tapes were found. I know it seems like nit-picking, but you knew that the footage shown in PA1 was found when the police showed up and found Micah and thus the video footage on the computer, the footage shown in PA2 was found when the police showed up after the murders of Kristie and Dan... but where were these \"missing tape \"found\"? it seems like they could have at least explained that the tapes had been found in the attic of Katie and Micah's house like the burnt picture had been... something would have been better than nothing.The first part of the Old footage was pretty good if watched by itself, but as a part of the series there were some inconsistencies, such as the Demon being \"attached\" to Kristie, yet in PA1 Katie states that the Demon had been attached to her and that Kristie had simply \"seen it too\". Also, the fact that the demon was given a name as sinister and frightening as TOBY did a lot to take away from the scare factor. on top of that it just seemed like Toby just had a thing for little girls.Also there were some scenes in the previews that simply weren't in the movie such as the two girls playing Bloody Mary, one of the girls walking off of the second floor balcony, \"the knocking game\", the medium getting smashed into the table by an unseen force, the kid throwing water in the demon and things flying around the room, the mom getting pulled into the room and pinned to the bed, and... THE FIRE that was talked about so much in PA1! all of these were in \"official previews\" yet weren't in the movie. instead we got a cult of angry old women?I was expecting A LOT better and a movie that fit in with the whole back story from the first two movies and help tie them all in together. Also, where was the Epilogue? Like, \"Lois' house was sold in 2005 following her death, It was destroyed in a fire in October of 2006. The Bodies of Julie and Dennis have never been found\". Anything? Nothing? Some sort of follow up on what we had just seen like in the first two movies?"

The \"video\" quality is way too good to be VHS filmed in the 80's and stored for 23 years or so.  Also, the acting seemed like... well, acting!  In my opinion, there wasnt enough scare or creepy factor.  Too much just day to day activities going on and it was all just a little too cheesy.  However, it did keep my attention for the full movie and I am shocked in myself for wanting a 4th movie... maybe in hopes they can recapture what the first two movies had or just to find out what happened to that baby from the 2nd movie."

There is nothing original in this movie, which is to be expected considering the concept has a very limited framework (family sets up camera, things happen, someone believes it, someone doesn't believe it, someone dies). This one waits over an hour to have anything happen, has one of the worst set designer/wardrobe combinations ever, (wasn't it supposed to be in the 80's?), and moves into ridiculous territory for it's ending. Typical of Hollywood's \"drive a good idea into the ground then kick it a few times\" philosophy of late. Save yourself the time and money."

When i walked into the theater there was about 7 people including me.I thought i was early,when the movie started i turned around and there was the same people,and in the middle and end.I bet if you put all the scary parts together its about a 3 min. movie.In the end (when the credits started playing) everyone in the theater(including me) thought half way through they were going to scare you or ther was more.There wasn't.So me and everyone in the theater(7 people) wasted about 5 or 6 min. watching the credits and by the end we all felt like fools. My over all thoughts are that it sucked and me or any one besides ariel schulman could make a better movie."

      "text": "Okay, so normally i liked the first 2 Paranormal Activity movies. A bit boring, but still pretty great horror movies. Now, we got Paranormal Activity 3. It follows the story of Katie and Kristi when they were kids and how did the demon first started terrorizing them. Plot's pretty predictable, the acting was fine but i expected more. The one and big problem for it is that there's a lotta cool and scary moments in the trailer, but they're NOT actually in the movie. I saw the movie and i was like \"Where are the best parts from the trailer? This kinda feels really boring!\" That's the number 1 fail in this movie, that's the thing that totally let the movie down. And what's weird is that after the movie was done, i went home and slept like a baby. Seriously, this time it felt less scary and more boring than the other movies. So, overall the acting was fine, but they should've put the best parts from the trailer in the movie to make it less boring and more exciting and creepy. But, they didn't, and that totally sucks. Paranormal Activity 3, it's alright but you'll forget it in 2 hours. That's what happen, i went home and in 2 hours, i couldn't remember it at all. So, if you wanna see it, then go ahead. But if you wanna see good found-footage horror movie, then save your money and skip this."

I'm sorry. It's 1988. And the sisters, Katie (Katie Featherston in PA1) and Kristi (Sprague Grayden in PA2), are just pre-teeners, played respectively by Chloe Csengery and Jessica Tyler Brown. Kristi talks a lot to Toby, her \"imaginary\" friend.  Mom Julie (Lauren Bittner) is concerned, but stepdad Dennis (Chris Smith) is a wedding videographer so he knows how to set up cameras around their SoCal house to catch any mischievous ghosts in action. If you can't fill in the rest of the plot, you haven't  seen the first Paranormal Activity or any movie at all. PA3 is shoddy goods with any hint of orginality sucked out of it. Have something pop out in the dark. Wait for a scream. Then drag out the next surprise for an eternity. Repeat cycle. I expected better from directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, who scored so high with Catfish last year. But one of their gimmicks is a doozy: Stepdad straps one camera to a slowly moving fan, which will have audiences craning their necks while producing a meager payoff. I fully expect Paranormal Activity 3 to be box office gold. But it's barely worth two stars, let alone two cents. As for future followups, I offer this plea: STOP!"

      "text": "This film followed the success of the first two and works as a prequel to both. However, I felt it was much weaker, as the recipe that made success at first is already worn out.The script takes up the story of sisters Katie and Kristi but goes back to their childhood to give us an understanding of the source of the problem they both had with evil entities. Child actresses are good enough for what they are asked to do. Katie Featherston is just as good as in the first two films, but only enters in the initial scenes. Lauren Bittner is never as good or convincing as she was and Christopher Smith never shows talent because he plays an idiot, who acts in a seemingly random way. Interestingly, both he and his daughters' future husbands share the same strange fetish for home camcorders.As in the first film, there are no initial credits and the final credits have been reduced to what is required by law. There is also no soundtrack and most of the filming was done with a handheld camera or amateur cameras on tripods. The focus on making the film seemingly genuine remains and works. However, there is little new or different in this film, other than explaining the first two. Special effects are much more imaginative and lose some credibility, creating situations of illogic. The film is very slow and there are a lot of dead moments that seemed unnecessary. The first half of the film, in particular, is slow, tiring and has little to give us that is interesting. The ending is a little imaginative.After two good films, the third film in this franchise turned out to be much weaker, in part by betting on giving us more of the same and by abandoning improvisation in favor of more elaborate scenes and scares and, therefore, much less credible. . It is a pity."

I am not lying people when I say the scariest scenes are in the TRAILER and not the MOVIE. The movie is missing approx 7-8 scenes.

The Paranormal Activity series has taken the low-tech \"bump in the night\" approach and made it work for three films.  While I enjoyed it, I believe this is the weakest of the three.  While it is gifted at building tension it doesn't provide as satisfying a payoff as the two previous films.  The story also gives very little attention to the reason behind the mayhem.  I would have preferred a more complete explanation for all the bumps in the night.  Even with these complaints, Paranormal Activity 3 is far better than any of the Saw films and 99 percent of all the other so-called horror flicks.  That's why I gave it a 7."

      "text": "Before I get to the substance of my review, I have to describe a fairly shocking incident that occurred in my theater just a little while ago - the first Thursday night, 10pm showing in Santa Monica. And this no B.S.  About 30 minutes into the film, just after the subtitles read \"Night 13\", a young guy sitting 2 rows in front of me started groaning/yelling.  He was in a group of six - looked like a triple date - and they had been fairly squirrely up to that point, so I assumed he was just playing up the tension as people are prone to do in horror movies - testing each other and themselves. I suppose it's easier to laugh than to give in to the fear. Turns out it was the onset of a full-blown seizure.  People started bounding over rows to help the guy brace himself and the lights came up - he didn't stop shaking for about a minute.  He apparently had no history of seizures - which is what he told the firemen after he came to.  His friends were blown away, and the packed out theater couldn't believe it. Could the tension from the film have caused or contribute to it? I have no idea.  The firemen were asking a lot of questions about drug use - the friends were confident in ruling it out. (Personally, he didn't seem like the type, but what do I know?) It made the rest of the film a little creepier knowing it could have a physical effect on someone... So after a 20 minute break in the action, they started the film again (and gave us all free tickets for another show). There was some good-natured daring of each other to sit in that kid's seat for the rest of the movie - no takers. So, was the movie as good as the first two?  I'd say no, but it certainly was able to construct an entirely new sort of tension. The late-80s VHS feel to the thing was refreshing  My heart was racing for most of the last 15 minutes or so.  I'd give the \"experience\" of the evening about a 9, but the movie?  About a 6."

Theyve cut off most of the movie and the best parts. This is very frustrating and annoying, this movie couldve been a thousand times better. There was yet another abrupt ending that made no sense. Seems as thoughtheres alot of plot holes. They didnt explain very much of what katy and christie said in the first 2 movies.

      "text": "I must say. It was a challenge to make a new & refreshing formula boring at the end of its third installment. While the first sequel covered some new ground, the third does nothing new. I admit it, I was curious about the way all of this started. The problem I have with PE3 is that it focused on the same plain dumb moments during the movie, when they stop watching the footage and argue (watch it! no! it's stupid, there's nothing to talk about. there are no ghost. stop the cameras!).Doing that once is okay - people are people and I can understand such behavior. But 3 times in a row? Please...The actors do their job well, the visuals are on par, but the story doesn't catch up. As stated before, the whole explanation (if you could call it that) took no more than a minute and was really shallow. I guess now we can expect part 4, which will concentrate on the actions from the movies finale.To wrap things up - if you are new to the series, give it a shot. It would be actually easier to watch the trilogy from the end. If you've seen the first two movies, you'll probably end up dissapointed with the movie and plot as a whole. There are some moments worth seeing. It's just a bit sad, that they don't get enough attention from the plot."

It implored some good scare tactics, and at points it's scary as hell, but not as good as the first two.

      "text": "Paranormal Activity started the phenomenon of films that are shot on camcorder. At the time, it was considered to be revolutionary, but at this point it's getting a little old. How many of these camcorder films have actually been successful? ...and don't you get just the slightest bit nauseated by the constant movement of the camera? I guess that's for you to decide, back to the film. In the third installment of Paranormal Activity, we learn what happened to Katie and her sister when they were little. To be honest with you, I was pretty into this film until the last twenty minutes or so. Without spoiling it for ya, lets just say the story takes a dramatic turn away from the storyline. The result of this is that the overall story isn't as creepy and really doesn't make as much sense as it should. Paranormal Activity was never that scary to begin with, the film plays on the audience by having things suddenly jump out at them, but the story itself has gotten far less creepier as the series has gone on. Part 3 and 4 do have different writer/directors and that may be part of the problem. The first one freaked me out, the second one was a little slow, but also did the trick, and this one really didn't scare me. They relied much more on making the audience jump than they did on scaring them with the actual story. Number three didn't stick with me for days afterward, the way one and two did. As for the cast, they were all newcomers and the little girls were absolutely terrific! This series has a way of finding newcomers who seem like they've been acting for decades. Paranormal Activity 3 is good for a few cheap jumps and laughs, but the ending was really disappointing, leading me to think less of this film than I do of the other two."

I'll not drone on about camera technique, nor the type of medium used,(tho I will say the acting and direction of the two lil starlets in this piece was great :-D ). As most know this story chronicles the \"other worldly\" lives of two sisters but in reverse, the latest film being them as children. I did enjoy the first two,seeing them on DVD, but was hesitant to spend money at a large theater filled with whispers and cell phones when in a couple months I could watch it for half the price in the comfort of my home.My niece , however, also a fan of the scream screen, was desperate to the point of, \"I'll die if i can't see it opening night at midnight!!\", and it being R rated...I couldn't give her money and toss her at the mall while pausing in front of the doors, and go to Applebee's for a couple **** while I waited. So, being the dutiful Uncle I am, I grudgingly relaxed a little after work and grumbled up to the theater so she could see the premier. Once seated in the theater, the previews included a trailer of  a P.A. (Paranormal Activity) type movie involving a mental hospital and exorcisms with some very good special affects were played, adding to the normal tension associated with horror flicks in the the theater. The film began with no hoopla or credits, it was just there and playing. I could feel the anxiey n the place rise like a presence to a point where allmost all \"surprise\" in the film caused shrieks and giggles and I was bored already, but very soon...I developed a wickid lil grin. This was the best of the three, the screams from the audience were nearly defening and even young men were clenching so fast they came out of their seats and trashed anybravado they had shown coming in, while I was trying hard to watch the entire screen so I wouldn't miss any of the lil \"creepys\" that popped up. My 12 year old niece in the mean time went from a state of interest, to fasination, to mild fear up to an occation \"freak-out\", (baring in mind she' a BIG fan of \"the Grudge\" tp the point of knowing all the characters and watching the japanese version \"Ju-on\" as well as \"The Ring\" and the \"Saws\" franchise)but thats the point of going to these things in the first place. I was her age when the original \"exorcist\" came out and, like her, I was looking in the shadows and searched every room when I got homeand even having the light on was only minor comfort,( noooo Im NOT mean...she wants to see it again by the way) Long story short, ( to late),this is a must see film worth admissionlike a good roller coaster it should make you walk out going \"HOLY CRAP\" or it's just another day. ;-P......P.S.

It creates a great sense of dread without the impassable drudging through night after night of nothingness like in the second film.

Until the ghost started to terrorize the entire family, while their dad tape record the entire house. We can tell that it has the same thing all over again, but in the different way. Also, we have new characters to tell back were they started. Here we have Katie and Kristi and they did pretty well. The parents are bit okay, but sometimes they're stupid at the same time. Finally, the scenes are very scary that I got chills while watching at it. They do boogie sounds, they do noises, and they haunted everywhere. In my conclusion, this movie is far scary than the second and the first one does more scare and third gets more chill to see."

Dragged across the floor check, thrown furniture check, moving lights check.  On the bright side it has a lot more laughs than the first two and definately adds to the story allowing a follow up."

Now basing it on experience in a theater and having an great night out with my wife watching this suspenseful comedy movie (because it is nothing more than comedy) I give it a 10 for the heartbeats it delivers. As for the movie itself if I was to watch it at home (like I did with Paranormal Activity 1), it will bore you to tears and make you want to die from boredom which may be then considered paranormal on the part of others speculating the cause of your death.This movie was much better than the first one though."

This is one of the few scary movies I've watched by myself at 2 AM (I'm 34 by the way) that didn't scare me. Well it did at times, but I didn't feel the dread I shoul feel during a scary movie. Okay it's worth the 5-6 bucks, but you won't be sleeping with your parents after this one (what?)."

      "text": "As horror movies go, PA3 is great, containing clever ways to shock viewers. But as PA movies go, it shows that the current series as it stands is beginning to show its age. PA3 does have more creative events then PA2 (which was really just more of the exact same from PA1). Even so, I have become trained enough by the first two movies that when I saw this one I already knew exactly when surprises would occur, which goes to show that PA3 really should have done even more to differentiate itself from its predecessors. It tries to explain some of the backstory to give a reason behind everything that happens in the first two movies. However, it only goes so far in this as to allude to a witches coven, which is a disappointingly flat and uncreative twist that failed to serve the atmosphere of the series, and made me wish that the writers had just left it unexplained, because the PA series is one that thrives on the unknown in the first place. But even with these misgivings, PA3 is still a hell of a lot more effective then basically all other modern horror movies. If you have never seen a PA movie before, I do recommend this one (the plots of the three movies are independent enough of each other that they can be watched in any order) because it at least understands how to go about scaring someone, which cannot be said for any other series, and that alone warrants a score above average."

They are saving it for the unrated DVD version. Which is really annoying considering that would be like a toatal of 20 min of footage taken out."

The young child actors were the best actors of the movie. The simple and effective scares work well and are more interesting and effective than many big budget horror movies. I would have liked it better if they answered more questions to who, what, why at the end but I enjoyed nonetheless. Recommended"

This was not a problem in PA3.  I do not scare easy but over and over my hair was up on end.  There were plenty of thrills and I left entertained.  Isn't that the whole point of a movie,  to be entertained?  Overall I enjoyed the movie."
