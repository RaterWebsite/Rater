But overall a good adaptation, especially the equipment was top."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Based on the novel by Alexandre Dumas, this is the story of revenge Edmond Dantes, a man betrayed by his friends and imprisoned for a crime he did not commit. Directed by Kevin Reynolds, has a screenplay adapted by Jay Wolpert and has Jim Caviezel in the title role.This story is well known and is very good in film. Its an appealing story, with romance, good arguments for action and all that general public tends to like. Nevertheless, its not an action film, but a drama, focused on the destroyed life of a man and his thirst for revenge. The script is not brilliant, nor can we be tempted to compare it with the original book. But it does a competent job and transpose to the screen most of the major aspects of the novel, while adapting some points and bringing some new features that don't appear in the book, for dramatic purposes. In my opinion, the greatest sin of this script is the too much focus on Mondego, so that the revenge Dant\u00e9s exerts on other three conspirators is hardly explained (one of Them ends up not even appear in the film).The main actors are Jim Caviezel and Guy Pearce, respectively in the role of protagonist and the main villain. Both are good investments: Pearce can be annoying with his arrogant attitude and Caviezel gives his character a certain hardness, without losing kindness and sense of justice. But this is not one of the best films of the two actors. It was shot at very attractive locations, from a visual point of view, and has good visual effects and costumes.In short: it's a good movie, which easily appeals to everyone and fulfills its role to entertain and tell a story.

Both friends but opposed to each other. The following events are susteined and justified by the personalities and the occasion the characters are on.

Indeed, it's Alexandre Dumas's masterfully staged tale of retribution and duplicity that helps keep the audience on the edges of their seats, but credit should be given to the screenwriter for compressing a thousand-page book into a single, coherent, cinematic narrative. The solid direction from Kevin Reynolds also helps anchor some of the larger set pieces and action sequences down to a consistently impressive level of realism. It also helps that you have Guy Pearce playing on of the douchiest characters in literary history - Count Fernand Mondego. Pretty solid flick overall."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "While the scriptwriters took some liberties with the Dumas classic (and keeping in mind that no novel can translate perfectly to film), this version does an excellent job of telling a story that honors the original while making it accessible to younger audiences.
