      "text": "A character study of the most socially well-adjusted subject, with both short-term and long-term memory loss.The stylistic choice of editing the film in reverse, to help the audience relate and understand the character of Leonard (as well as his condition), is a stroke of genius for director Christopher Nolan and film editor Dody Dorn. It is a rarity to find a film that makes an effort to convey how a character perceives the world around them.Obviously, there is a lot more detail to pick up on with multiple viewings of this film, and it is quite sound in the psychology department - as far as how damage to the hippocampus affects memory at least. Which adds to the effect of having the film's events play out in way that feels all too real.The acting is also quite the accomplishment, there is not a single weak performance from anyone in the film. There really isn\u2019t much more I can add to the discussion about how good Guy Pearce\u2019s performance was. He really does embody someone obsessed with the notion of how justice needs only a person's own perceived facts, no discussion or critic necessary. In many ways this film parables the folly of Egocentrism; in that how many people are unable to fit new information into their own personal perception of the world.If you are looking for a film tells an interesting story both contextually and narratively, then I would highly recommend Memento."

There is such deep thought put into this film. I also read the story his brother wrote as inspiration for the film, and liked it as well. Of course the film instantly grabs your attention with a gory photo of a man covered in blood, but the film also keeps you engaged, as every scene is shot to perfection. Perfect cast, excellent acting. Even the 'sick and twisted' ending, I would not change, its just extra flare, like a cherry on top. This film oozzes EXCELLENCE on all levels."

      "text": "If I could remember it, I'd call it the most malleable mythology I ever faced.MementoNolan's career defining and signature marking neo noir film is a bold statement on not just filmmaking but entertainment industry too. And he does it by raising a simple question. How far should you go as a storyteller to express yourself and communicate coherently to your viewers? In this case, it is evidently reported for 8 years to put all this puzzled work in one big crime scene. Leanord (Guy Pearce) is suffering from short term memory loss and for a guy who can barely survive going through his own routine, he has embarked himself to cross a big revengeful mountain.To be honest, the film does most of its magic on paper. What's to wonder about is, Nolan who used props and elements for the style in Following, has now cornered himself into being obliged to use those same props. But this is Nolan, he doesn't bow down to such limitations in the script. He has simply jumbled up the events for some levity and uses it to give you enough reason to hang on to this trippy ride. Once again, the editing gets a shout out, But I'd also like to mention Nolan's choice of picturization of those abstract yet contextual repetitive part of the act. He hides the facts by acknowledging the fact that he is hiding it. Nolan has confessed that he loved using the similar picturization of both the flashbacks and real time screenplay that he learned from Terrence Malick's style, especially from The Thin Red Line.Let's follow the lead character Leonard and Pearce embodying a tattooed (scarred) personality as such. The bluff of Nolan is how to make him sympathetic that goes unnoticed in the film. His handicapped part of the personality is abused over and over by the other characters that actually mirrors their own figure, and as a result you are worried sick and exhausted by this experience. And Pearce plays it simply as Nolan reveals it in the \"guilty\" section of the storytelling, later in the film. The assumption is what leads us into this misunderstanding. Not the props, not the Memento."

I have to believe that when my eyes are closed, the world's still there. Do I believe the world's still there? Is it still out there?... Yeah. We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are. I'm no different.\"Christopher Nolan once again creates one of the most mind bending and thrilling movie that has to be one of the greatest experiance you will have on film history. Memento is a confusing but a clever and unique movie that will blow your mind just by a few minutes into the movie. This Movie also relates to Insomnia and Inception, meaning the filming (using random flashbacks and using some sort of strange vision, like filming backwards or extreme close-ups).Christopher Nolan also brings back the looks and characters to his later movies, Like the name Kobb from Followin, might refer to Dom \"Cobb\" from Inception and the looks of Teddy and Catherine from Memento to Gordon (Batman Begins and Dark Knight) and Maul (Inception). Memento is based on the short story, Memento Mori, witch Guy Pearce Dominates in this classic thriller playing Leonard, a man with short-term memory loss that wakes up in a random room, not knowing what's going on, until looking at his body. tattoos fill up his chest with one saying \"JOHN G. RAPED AND MURDERED MY WIFE\", and the rest saying facts leading up to the murderer. He also finds his Polaroid pictures, one with a guy with glasses and a mustache, named Teddy, and other pictures of information. Everyday he has to go through the same thing, so you gotta feel bad for the guy. For the rest, you probably have to find out the stuff yourself. I love how Nolan takes control of his movies like this, I guess he wants everything to be good, and he did a pretty good job doing so. He creates the most innovated dramas that nobody can miss, and thats why he goes right up to one of my favorite directors. Thuis movie is also filmed in different time periods like Following, except playing the parts of the movie backwards, making the beginning actually the ending. If this movie is too confusing for you, the ending will sum it all up for you, then you can watch it the second time to try to pick up info, like I did, and boy was I confused."

      "text": "The movie \"Memento\" is one bizarre illustration of a rape story and its later consequences. It sets off with a murder from the look of which, the protagonist of the movie kills the guy who's raped and got it over with his wife. The look of satisfaction and enthusiasm on his face implies that he's gotten his revenge and will live relieved after this, but you can never say that as there is no afterward events; the story enjoys a reverse chronology. In a story employing this technique, the first scene shown is actually the conclusion to the plot. Once that scene ends, the penultimate scene is shown, and so on, so that the final scene the viewer sees is the first chronologically.\rThis 2000 Christopher Nolan movie which is made well before Batman trilogy, The Prestige, and Inception, is based on a short story from Johnathan Nolan, the outstanding director\u2019s brother who has been the co-screenwriter for Nolan\u2019s other great works as well. All the first scenes are happening after the next one and just come to an end when the other one starts which is as strange on paper as it looks on the screen! Nonetheless, this is not the most moving factor in the movie as it is about to get even creepier. The main character of the story, Leonard Shelby [personalized by Guy Pearce] has lost his short memory in the unfortunate incident in a fight with the jerk raping his love. He would only keep the stuff going around him in his recollection for less than ten minutes. To remember things by, he has developed this taking pictures plus adding notes under them method. He usually carries a camera around and takes pictures from the people and places to have in his pocket which will be his only tool to judge people on their good and bad nature. It does not often pay off as the man would choose to write notes about people at the wrong time.\rBesides, Lenny has developed the habit of getting tattoos on his body about very important facts and information. The numbers of tattoos increase constantly, but never stop. The main character, who remembers to be a psychologist, usually talks of a Sammy Jackson which the viewer can never be certain of its existence which is the most terrifying fact.\rThe movie leaves the viewer holding the bag and awing at the heaviness of a 2-hour backward story. It educates you that you can never judge people based on one situation, teaches you that even short term memory is a full blessing, and shows you that everything could start only when you think they've come to a bitter end.\rThere it is: Christopher Nolan's weirdly overwhelming haunting movie that will make your jaw drop and leave you asking \"what did I just watch?\""

What's very interesting is how you have to think for a while then you get it. Spoilers ahead stop reading if you haven't seen it yet! You have the movie starting with him shooting Teddy, and then how he got there in the next scene, but what's funny is you think it's leading up to (or I guess leading down to) how he's going to reveal that Teddy is the bad guy. He is not! He's a cop, a not crooked one but a cop all the same, that's using a guy with no short-term memory to kill off drug dealers. Then you have Natalie, who seems nice but is ripping him off just the same and is using him to kill drug dealers that are competition and to get the cop off of the streets. You have him being used by everyone around to fit their purpose, turning him from a man on a revenged quest to basically a serial killer. They make him kill who they want as long as they justify it will help him. It's very well told and really makes you mad that the guy you're rotting for is a killer that's been duped. Nobody is a good guy. There is no hero. And why is it good then? It plays with your mind so well, you walk away and contemplate on it forever. Great movie, one of Nolan's best ever."
