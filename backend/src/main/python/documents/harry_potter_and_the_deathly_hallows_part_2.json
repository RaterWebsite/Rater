I remember the pride I felt the first time they sat in my lap reading the big potter book to me.  Soon enough they both finished the first book and declared they were ready for the movie.  There was rhythm as the kids devoured the books and demanded the movies.  Their reading out paced the production and have waited with the rest of the world for the movies to come.  Something is lost as the series ends.  The first big books they ever read, and the first big kid movies they ever watched.  The movie is wonderful.  The series is wonderful.  Watching my children experience both has been a joy of fatherhood."

Many people grew up reading and watching the Harry Potter story, and this final movie reaches the peak of maturity in subject matter. It deals with honor, death, love, and sacrifice. Thank you Ms. Rowling for teaching our younger generation these important values."

However, I have watched every film so I've managed to keep up with the series.  As a result, I will rate this AS A FILM rather than a book adaptation.  As a film, this is fantastic on every front.  Splitting the film into two parts was the best thing they could've done.  I felt the first part had a couple of pacing issues, but was still pretty great.  This one is perfectly paced.  I was gripped constantly.  A fantastic balance of story and action.  Every character was excellent portrayed and I really felt that each one of them had a good level of depth. The script was also fantastic.  It never felt clich\u00c3\u00a9, the amount of humour was just right and it's just overall very well written.  The action, the story, the character development, the romance, the humour.  It's all so perfectly balanced.  Nothing ever felt forced.  Overall this is a phenomenal film.  Every Harry Potter fan should see this, and even if you aren't a fan, watch it because it's a GOOD film (though I would recommend at least watching a couple of the previous films beforehand to have some sort of an idea of what's going on)."

I think it was just a show of special effects that I should say where really good but I prefer a ugly movie with a good plot before pretty movie without one. Also I think the movie is a shame for those who read the book, and even more for those who don\u00e2"

      "text": "I am convinced that the critics who have raved about this movie and have given it such positive reviews haven't actually read the books. This movie diverges from the actual book way more than I could appreciate as a HP fan. The Hogwarts battle scenes seem to be the director's own version of the events rather than a recreation of the book (if you've seen the trailers, you would have suspected as much). Unfortunately, while the first four movies brilliantly followed the books (given the time constraints of a movie), ever since director David Yates got involved, the movies have moved away from the books (Half Blood Prince being a great example of Yates doing his own thing). Deathly Hallows 2 in my view does an even poorer job of visually recreating the book than Half Blood Prince did. In summary a most disappointing end to the Harry Potter years"

      "text": "Figuring out how to appropriately explain this film in a fair light is impossible.  Without reading the books I can't say how much was left out.  But what I can say is that, while the books are incredible (from what I hear), most movies are not true screen adaptations that capture everything that might be important or wonderful from the text.  Yates did a wonderful job wrapping up the series.  Deathly Hallows Part 2 comes off as more engaging and more fun than Part 1 as a movie, given that there is a lot more going on, and ultimately ends up being one of the most enjoyable Harry Potter films of the whole series.  I would have gladly given another 20 minutes for Yates & crew to explain and appropriately tie up the entire story as many fans (both those who enjoyed and were disappointed) have commented on.  But what's done is done.  It's not quite perfect, but it's a wonderful and successful ending to what has been one of the most important adaptations ever.  I'll certainly miss seeing the world and characters of Harry Potter in new ways, but at least there were so many films to give breath visually to a series JK Rowling created... and in the scope of a childrens novel.  The movie is great, and it leaves you wanting more as it makes an exit in \"styyyle\"."

      "text": "It seems a lot of Potter fans are so lost and deluded in their love of the source material that they forget that the films here actually need to be films and not primarily a soulless copycat of the novels. This isn't perfectly judged but the vast majority of it has been and it is an exceptionally well made blockbuster with enough soul to match the heavy effects that feature this time. However what is really testament to the success of not just this film but also of the whole series, is that the quieter and more character drive moments really outshine the action and spectacle. Exceptional performances from the whole cast and it has a rousing and satisfying conclusion. It's a shame not all the secondary characters get the send off most would have liked but it is a minor quibble. A powerful end to a mighty series."

Though it may be difficult to watch for some fans of the book (like me) without being slightly disappointed with all of the things left out of the movies, but it stands very well on its own.  The best part of the movie for me were the performances of Alan Rickman as Snape (especially during the scene in the Pensive) and Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort which were both perfect.  There were also great visual effects and a beautiful score by Alexandre Desplat though the epilogue was pretty terrible in my opinion.  Still, it was a satisfying, and well made conclusion to the phenomenon that my entire generation has grown up reading and loving."

The film was both breathtakingly epic and breathtakingly emotional, to the nth degree. Although not done by John Williams, the film score is excellent and speaks so much without words. Snape's flashbacks were brilliantly done, and this time, every departure from the book only makes the impact greater. And at the very end, the film wraps back around in mood to the warm, enchanting feel of the first film by using John Williams's original movie score, invoking both nostalgia and satisfaction. Everyone is sad to see Harry Potter go and the director knows it, and he pulls out all the stops to tease the viewers' tear ducts. A wonderful conclusion to a wonderful series."

      "text": "\"It All Ends\" is the slogan for the ultimate finale that is 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2', a riveting, exciting and fast-paced finale filled with nothing more than emotional satisfaction. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is back, along with his best friends; Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint), after escaping the Malfoy's house and moving on from the tragic death of Dobby in the hands of Bellatrix (Helena Bonham Carter), the search for the remaining horcruxes continue.As their search for the last few horcruxes continue, Harry discovers that Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is closer to him than he thinks, when they need to get back to Hogwarts to find the remaining horcruxes, they meet a mysterious man who goes by the name Aberforth Dumbledore (Ciaran Hinds), Albus' brother. Aberforth, as it seems, was not very close to his late brother, and raises the suspicion that Albus (Michael Gambon) was not to be trusted as he has kept many secret things from Harry. But Harry claims that he trusted the man he knew. On their way back to Hogwarts, Neville (Matthew Lewis) leads them back, and it seems that the school has become a war zone. Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) has become the headmaster since he killed Dumbledore, and informs the students that if they know Harry's whereabouts and even attempts to help him, they will be punished. Then the war begins, Harry destroys as many of the last remaining horcruxes that he could find, he discovers the truth about one particular Hogwarts professor, and he finally comes face to face with his nemesis, Voldemort. 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2' is a worthy finale to a long running franchise. Director, David Yates has crafted the most exciting movie in the chapter, the most exciting since 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' (2005), and the events unfold in a clean and fast-paced fashion. Fans of the franchise will love what they see. No finale has truly felt more dramatic and emotionally satisfying at the same time... this is the winner of all finales."

There are parts that I liked a lot and there are also parts that I disliked. I liked almost every scene but Snape stood out. Snape was wonderful in this film, his story, his scenes and the acting was brilliant. Voldemort was also great in this film. Everyone acted well so I won't be complaining about bad acting. Now to the parts that I didn't really like. Fred Weasley and Lupin's death.They died in a very anticlimactic way. It wasn't as sad as it was supposed to be. These two are important characters. They just showed their dead bodies and that's it. Another thing is that Malfoy, Hagrid and other supporting characters didn't appear that much. The epilogue is something that I have mixed feelings about. It was in the book and I think it gave the film makers a hard time. The cool thing about the epilogue is seeing how the characters grew and seeing their children going to their same school. The not-so-good thing is that the actors looked silly. The boys (Harry, Ron and Malfoy) looked like normal adults but the girls looked almost the same. Hermione looks like she didn't even age. But the epilogue and other minor bad things didn't ruin the film for me. Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows Part 2 is great film and a good and satisfying conclusion to the series."

The main reason being that, given the movie was split into two films for the purpose of staying true to the book, there was still many variations to Rowling's text in Hallows Part 2. These variations however, proved to make the movie more action orientated, cinematic and easy to understand for fans of the movies and not the books. I am only disappointed at the fact that because of past movies, Hallows Part 2 needed to tie loose ends in accordance with what was seen on screen and not in the books. As an adaptation, I feel somewhat cheated, due to the fact that the text was so rich with detail that went unseen in the film. As an action film however, Hallows Part 2 does extremely well. The main plot-line is still there, and I am pleased that Yates really delivered in the final battle. (In the book, the final battle is not as tense nor engaging and I commend Yates for his work). Soundtrack was magnificent, which really added to certain scenes in the film, especially 'Snapes Memories' and the scene where Harry  knew he was going to die. These amendments all add to the missing scenes from the text, which makes this film a fitting finale."

      "text": "It all has to end, every single minute of the 18 hour-long Harry Potter movies preceding this one have been leading up to this moment. There was incredible hype for The Deathly Hallows Part 2 ever since the final scenes of the DH 1, and it has the impossible task of meeting the expectations that it has set for itself which is incredibly high. This is the perfect way to end the best movie franchise ever made. It's amazing to actually take a step back and look at all of the 8 movies, it never drops in quality and the shifts in the tone of the movies is just bloody awesome from the Sorcerer's Stone's light, funny, cheerful tone to the very dark and serious tone of the Half-Blood Prince, and Deathly Hallows 1 and 2. As always Mr Yates gets into the thick of the action and assumes that the audience knows everything and literally picks up where DH1 ended. Hogwarts surrounded by hovering Dementors and a despondent-looking new headmaster Severus Snape, cue the title sequence. You know you're in good hands. For the fans who did not like the DH1 citing a lack of action sequences and a slow dragging story (I really enjoyed DH1) will be satisfied with this one. Almost immediately it starts with a break-in into Gringotts bank with Harry and a creepy looking goblin on his back under the invisibility cloak, Ron wearing a goatee and Hermione taking the form of Bellatrix Lestrange via the polyjuice potion. Helena Bonham Carter was absolutely amusing impersonating Emma Watson's character impersonating her. Searching for a horcrux, followed swiftly by an abrupt escape plan with the trio holding on for dear life on a dragon. Action sequence junkies you'll love this movie. The special effects in this one is great, amazing looking wand duels, knights, trolls and everything in between as Hogwarts is turned into a battlefield not dissimilar to the Lord of the Rings' movies. The calm before the storm is very similar to The Two Towers when they're preparing for the arrival of Voldermort and his posse, everything is so well-paced and the story just flows effortlessly. But even with all that in abundance, the heart of the movie will always be in the close intimate scenes, the CGI effects will never upstage the emotional core of the movie, two life-long friends finally share a tender moment, a boy circled by his deceased family and his reunion with the man he so much admired and so much more. There are a lot of deaths and I'm quite surprised that a fair amount of them occurs off screen, probably it's supposed to give a much stronger impact but I really wanted to see the demise of some of them. All in all the story was very solid and so unbelievably satisfying. Desplat's score, hauntingly magnificent. Truly beautiful and laced with bits from John Williams' and Nicholas Hooper's pieces, reminding us of much simpler and happy times and when everything came crashing down respectively. Eduardo Serra's cinematography is phenomenal, really capturing the look and feel of the movie as he did in part 1, you really feel that death is coming for Hogwarts. The stand-out performance for DH 1 was Emma Watson, DH 2 is where Daniel Radcliffe really shines. Harry Potter is no longer just the boy who lived, he's grown into a man on a mission, now equipped with a sense of authority and no one really questions him anymore, it's best to let him do what needs to be done. The negotiation scene with the goblin and with Mr. Ollivander was just so intense and delicately captured on screen showcasing a different side to Mr. Radcliffe. He was given a lot of dramatic and emotionally-heavy scenes and he really delivered, this was his movie along with Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, who have been in their roles for 10 years now, their casting really made the movie what it is. And let's not forget the most impressive supporting cast ever assembled with a slew of great British actors, you know who they are. Ralph Fiennes is menacing as the immortal Lord Voldermort but every time a Horcrux is destroyed he gets progressively weaker and Mr Fiennes' performance is very delicate showing the Dark Lord's vulnerability. Then there was the half-blood prince's revelatory piece which almost reduced me to tears. That was a heart-breaking montage of Snape's agendas and his sacrifices. Alan Rickman was outstanding showing the deeper, more emotional side of Severus Snape, give the man an Oscar already. For those that have been following ever since the first movie, the reward here is extremely gratifying. The epilogue of the movie which was set 19 years later was very bittersweet, did'tt want it to end. The final few moments before the screen faded to black, and before the sun sets on the best franchise ever made I also felt that the sun was setting on my childhood, saw the first movie when I was 10 years old, and it ended with the end of my teen years. I grew up with the movies. What a ride it has been, goodbye Harry Potter.."

Along the way, he met Ron Weasley and Hermonie Granger, who became his party companions as he quested to learn more about himself and come closer to his ultimate destiny; to kill Lord Voldemort.This one was a very emotional, but beautiful ending to a series that a majority of people my age grew up with, and it added more to its grand power by great direction, an excellent scrript, and powerful acting (especially from Alan Rickman, who really impressed me with his performance in both parts. I actually began to sympathize with Professor Snape when they showed his backstory from his last tear, as it almost made me cry), along with top-notch visual effects and a grand score.I can easily call this the best movie of the year, and I hope that people don't miss their last chance to see the boy wizard (unless they decide to reboot the series 20 years from now, which will anger a lot of people, including myself).So, in total, if I give this one 5 stars and the first part a 4-star rating, that would make the 2 parts together a 4.5 out of 5, which is solid for a Harry Potter film considering all the others except the 4th (never watched Azkaban) were not all that great.Harry had a good run, quite an impressive one at that.Part 1: B+Part 2: ATogether: A-"

I also thought that Part 2 was overall a very good and enjoyable movie with some phenomenal effects and several outstanding performances. That said, I am in utter shock at the overwhelmingly positive reviews here and particularly at Rotten Tomatoes. The movie was quite good, but it nonetheless had some glaring flaws. The pacing was off throughout the movie, the attempts at humor were mostly complete failures, and some of the changes made from the books were poorly considered. ***SPOILER ALERT***Positives: Helena Botham Carter as Hermione - best performance of the movie, with the right type of humor; the dragon escape from Gringots - brilliant effects and understated emotional and thematic elements; Alan Rickman - no more need be said; Warwick Davis - his biggest role in the movies yet, and he's great. The stone knights of Hogwarts, and all of the other visual effects.Negatives: Gringots was rushed, sense of danger too understated. How/why did Luna end up back at Hogwarts? Attempts at humor that distracted from the tone of the movie. Humor in a movie like this needs to shake one slightly out of their funk, laugh inside, and slingshot back into the dark mood with a reminder of the lightness that might yet be, not make a crowd laugh out loud or giggle (for examples, see almost anything done by Joss Whedon, or in the HP books themselves). Molly Weasley first being timid when approaching Bellatrix, then smiling after killing her just for a crowd-pleasing \"yay\" moment - not in character or tone. Finally, the last battle was too scattered and not nearly as good as in the book. Why not take advantage of a brilliantly written scene in which Neville is being burned under the sorting hat, with the rapid and dramatic change when he takes it off in defiance and removes the sword unexpectedly? Why send Ron and Hermione to try to kill Nagini when the surprise and shock of Neville killing her right in front of Voldemort would have been wonderful? This scene was drawn out by being stuffed with action, when it could have been paced properly to stress the emotions of the characters and the stakes instead. Instead of honest moments of triumph, we get false and contrived feeling moments.Final positive: The epilogue - recaptured the spirit of innocence and magic, bringing the story full-circle. This was the one part of the story I felt was delivered better in the movie than in the book."

The film overall is an epic film to cap off an epic series, although the ending is too cheesy for a series of this popularity. Very good 8/10."

Don't be surprised if Ralph Fiennes gets an Oscar nom-nod. And film might just make its way into the Academy's top 10 this year as well."

Alan Rickman as snape delivers  the most memorable sequence in the entire 8 film series that is saddening. Daniel Radcliffe steps  it up and is solid in this movie. For once i did not have to question whether or not he could act or not.\r One note: If you havnt at least seen part 1 you should catch up before seeing this one as it will be hard to understand otherwise."

The visuals are phenomenal, it's obvious that the filmmakers waited until the last film to give the visuals their all. The story is faithful enough to the book! Overall, I'm sad that the franchise has to end, but we'll always enjoy the series \"until the end\"."

      "text": "This is a fantastic closer, both as a film as and an adaptation, because the two go hand in hand. To all the fans who are upset about the ways the film divulges from the book, these changes were made with enormous respect to the source material and with the intention of making it a better MOVIE - more fast-paced, and with a more satisfying, suspenseful climax. The last book was one of my favorites, largely for the dense plot and character nuance that was (not entirely, but somewhat) absent from the film, but I can say that this is one of those rare cases where the changes made were almost entirely for the better. The parts that felt awkward, overly-complex, or overly-convenient in the book are reworked in a way that flows organically, without sacrificing the emotional impact. Almost every character has their moment to shine, and the most heartbreaking scenes from the book are played to perfection (Alan Rickman is outstanding) - it's intense, scary, funny, sad, and above all, satisfying to the people who have spent their childhoods with Harry. Well done!"

It's obvious that the source material has been treated with great care, and although the adaptation is not perfect, there are far more things done well, and exceeding expectations, than factors that disappointed. The acting, especially by Daniel Radcliffe, Alan Rickman and Ralph Fiennes, was wonderful. It was also pleasing to see almost all of the characters that we've seen throughout the series return for the final installment, and many of them are given moments to shine, as in the novel. What's most impressive is the staging of the epic action sequences which are both thrilling and suspenseful, and you feel feel a real sense that there is so much at stake. The pacing of the film is spot-on, not too rushed but not too slow, and by the final coda fans of the series, and even filmgoers simply seeing the film for entertainment should certainly be satisfied. 'Deathly Hallows Part 2' is not just the best film in the series, but ranks as one of the best action films of all time, and certainly the best film of 2011 this far. It's an excellent way to finish off such a monumental series."

The main logo of the movie very simple that the victory of good over evil but this simple thing is shown in such a way that you will find yourself in the war itself. David Yates has done a great job he has given his 100% to finish the Harry Potter series with an mind blowing end. The whole star cast has given their 100% as well. I suggest all of you to go and watch the movie in 2D because the theme of the movie is very dark so for better visuals go for 2D not for 3D. Everybody living in this planet should definitely watch this movie if you are a fan of Harry Potter then don't dare to miss this film. Full marks to this one. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2  will be the great legendary film for centuries."

Sadly, it does all come to an end but the Harry Potter franchise surpasses every expectation and delivers a grandstand finale of epic proportion in what is an unmissable and unforgettable film experiences of all time. With all the high expectations heading into The Deathly Hallows Part 2 it seemed impossible that this film could end up doing what does. Picking up from the tragic ending of Part 1 the film with Harry, Ron and Hermione searching for the remaining Horcruxes to destory Voldemort and Yates sets the tone very early on with an all out action raid on Gringotts bank. The only minor issue that I had with Part 1 was the pacing but this film runs at a very smooth and fast pace. One of the elements Yates displays very convincingly is the transformation in the atmosphere and feeling for the film. Long gone are the happy times of Quidditch, instead you now have the dark, gloomy skies, dragons, death-eaters and the Dark Lord himself. This works a treat because it not only emphasizes that this is the finale to this spectacular series but it makes it much more serious. There light-hearted moments but their timed to perfection and the focus is purely on the the final battle. And that is were this film excels overwhelmingly! The battle scenes were just extraordinary. Visually its encapsulating and mezmerising and once again gets across the epicness of this film. Its been compared to the LotR battle and rightly so its simply oustanding. The story was very well written, Yates manages to combine the story, the pace, the action and the acting incredibly well. One standout, as per usual, is Alan Rickman arguably the greatest performance of the Potter franchise as Severus Snape, he is magic as Snape as his true motives are revealed in what has to be some of the most emotional and poignant scenes of the movie but Daniel Radcliffe has his moment and delivers his best performance saving his best for last, he takes centre stage in the final third and is actually magestic. And there is plenty of emotion as expected after all this is it, the final Potter outing! There are sacrifices, deaths of much loved and maligned faces who we have come to love as well as the romance as Ron and Hermione share that much anticapted kiss. All this leading to the epic showdown between Harry Potter, the boy wonder, and Lord Voldemort. The epilogue in closing the film is very bittersweet seeing each character 19 years down the line was very moving as they sent their kids to Hogwarts but it brought this amazing series of films to a fantastic finish. In closing, I urge any film fan to see this movie. It is utterly essential to see the ending to this epic series. They have certainly saved the best for last and ensure that the greatest film franchise of all time ends in spectular and spell binding style! This film has everything a finale should have and will be remembered for years to come. Having grown up with the series since I was a little kid its sad to bid Harry and co farewell but Im left fully fulfilled and admiring the achievement they have delivered in this epic franchise. Mischief managed Harry, it was magic from start to finish!"

Starting off in with an eerie feeling of terror, as the menacing Snape overlooks a Nazi-esque Hogwarts. You start to wonder what has become of the wonderful magical world you fell inlove with 10 years ago. The mood quickly changes as you enter once again the life of Harry Potter. This movie will blow you away with incredible special effects, and superb acting, that in the end leaves you in tears when you realize that everyone, although a wizard, is truly human. You will exit the theatre overwhelmed and satisfied that you could bare witness to one of the most spectacular movies of our time"

I cannot say I have grown up with Harry Potter as when it was first released (Chamber of secrets) I had little interest in what I thought was going to be a kids movie, oh how I was wrong. I think the problem with the Harry Potter series is just how a lot of people overlook the sometimes subtle, sometimes painfully obvious undertones and hidden meanings of the scenes and characters. The dementors sucking life out of people like depression for example. I do genuinely believe JK Rowling to be an incredible writer with such an amazing imagination, anyway back to DH2. From the start scene to the end you will be gripped by a fast but well paced action/realistic depiction of war. Even more realistic than most war films out there. The number of casualties, the damage, the destruction and the bravery and terror. If you want to go and watch a film where you will find yourself upset one moment followed closely by a sense of joy then this is definitely the movie for you. How many times I must have been on the verge of crying followed shortly by a one liner that simply picked me up. I do not want to give anything away for those of you out there who do not know how this ends. All I can say is ignore any negative reviews go out and see it for yourself, you will be left amazed. After 10 years of waiting and 18 hours of watching Harry and friends grow up I think its time we owed it to ourselves to say our goodbyes and DH2 does this in style. A brilliant movie with fantastic cast, visuals and pace. Do yourself a favour book tickets now as I have a feeling this one will be around in cinemas across the UK for a while to come :). Enjoy."
