      "text": "I've loved this movie since I first saw it in theaters. It came out a little after the chainsaw remake and didn't receive a big release or a lot of publicity. Which is sad because it could have been a hit. It was also the last movie Stan Winston would do before passing. It centers on a young man trying to make an interview and a group of friends who have an accident because of a razor wire trap left in the road. Before you know it they are being hunted by three cannibalistic, inbred brothers who are superhuman, brutal, efficient and very hungry. The film is an electrifying combination of action, horror and sweaty palm inducing suspense. Eliza Dushku is always sultry in the lead, hottie is Desmond Harrington makes for a fine hero and Emmanuel Chirqui and Jeremy Sisto are engaging as a young engaged couple. Kevin Zegers and Lindsay Wallace of the dawn remake also star as a horny couple. The movie is directed confidently by Rob Schmidt of crime and punishment in suburbia and has some of the best, most creative kills of the decade. The cinematography is impressive as well both claustrophobic, innovative and sweeping when it comes to capturing the West Virginia wilderness.Budget: $12.6MBox Office: $28.7M9/10"

      "text": "Yet another generic white-trash slasher flick from the early 2000's- Wrong Turn proves to be nothing short of a Texas Chainsaw rip off- except with slightly more plot and far less style. It's easy to say I did not enjoy watching this movie. I try to keep an open mind on horror films in general, as many can be quite panned for silly reasons, but honestly I think this one deserves far more crap than it receives. The only good thing I can say about this film is that lead actor and Dexter star Desmond Harrington tries his best in his role. His lines can be written horribly and his character quite generic, but he does truly try throughout the film despite his inescapable character flaws- and is easily the best actor in the films entirety. The other actors vary from being the stereotypical horror cast members and characters we always see, to being annoying little turds that truly just got lucky to be in a film at all. So much of this film is just tedious nonsense, that it was honestly quite hard to sit through. The dialogue is repetitive, each scene is one stupid game of cat and mouse after the next, and none of it is interesting. The cinematography is done incredibly poorly, the look of the film as bland as can be, and the story is almost non-existent. None of it is frightening, very very little of it is amusing, and it's honestly a dud all the way through. It may not be the worst horror movie i've seen, but it is up there."
