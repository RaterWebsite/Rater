      "text": "Now this is the kind of breathtaking adventure that keeps me entertained all the way. Distributed by Disney and Pixar, Director Andrew Stanton has produced an incredible movie about the underwater sea life. It tells the story of a Clown fish called Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), who is very protective over his son Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould) after the loss of his family. Nemo grows increasingly tired of his Dad worrying all the time that on his first day of school, he disobeys his father and swims up to touch a speed boat. He then gets captured by a scuba diver. Marlin swims after him, but is too late and he quickly sets off on his speed boat. Marlin, swimming as fast as he can, soon bumps into a royal blue tang fish called Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres), who suffers from short term memory loss. The two then decide to work together and try and rescue Nemo (which from this point on is like going through this difficult quest - being chased by a shark, tackling jellyfish and swallowed by a whale) before it is too late. What I liked most about this movie was the jaw binding special effects. The CGI of the underwater oceans surroundings are breathtaking, and the designs of the fishes are nicely done, although a bit fake in the eyes I would say (don't recall there being fish eyes the size of a grapefruit). Of course the film wouldn't be as good without any good comedy performances from voice acting, and Finding Nemo managed to conquer that. All the actors/actresses played a good voice part, but I have to give full credit to Ellen DeGeneres. Her performance as Dory is absolutely brilliant, honestly she really plays the character so well and will provide audiences from 5 to 50 with great laughter, especially the one where she is trying to speak whale. I actually don't think they could have found another person to better Dory. What I like most about Pixar films is that they try to capture the audience to imagine what the character (whether it's a toy, an insect or a fish) inside is feeling, and what your reactions would be if you were the character. As well as joy and laughter, there's a real heart to this film. Finding Nemo is a truly epic masterpiece, filled with action/adventure and characters and emotions."

Plus, the animation is outstanding making you feel like you are underwater. Ten years later the animation has not aged a bit.

      "text": "The more things change, the more they stay the same. As we enter the summer of 2003, Walt Disney Pictures reigns supreme as the distributor of the best animated fare. Yet, less than a dozen years after Beauty and the Beast became the first (and thus far only) animated film nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, Disney's in-house animated division has degraded to the point where it's a pale shadow of its former self. However, by acquiring the exclusive North American distribution rights for the films of Japanese master Hayao Miyazaki and by entering into a partnership with Pixar Films, Disney has managed to maintain its position atop the mountain, despite furious challenges from Dreamworks and Fox. Without either of those deals \u2013 especially the Pixar one \u2013 Disney's once unassailable position might have been lost.\r The movies of the Pixar canon \u2013 Toy Story and its sequel, A Bug's Life, Monsters Inc. \u2013 have all been critical and box office successes. There is no reason to believe things will change with Finding Nemo. Visually, the film is just as jaw-dropping as its predecessors (if not more so). From a narrative standpoint, it's not quite as ambitious as some of the earlier movies, but it has enough juice to keep things moving for 100 minutes. And, as always, the voice casting is perfect. Throw in a moral, and some nice touches of technical accuracy (that fish keepers will appreciate), and the movie represents the best family film to-date of 2003.\r Pixar films always contain thematic content, and this one is no different. It touches on the issues of how a parent's natural protective instincts can drive away a child, and how children, no matter how desperately they crave independence, still need their families. None of this is presented in a heavy-handed manner. Instead, it's offered in such a way that even the younger members of the audience will understand what the film is saying without feeling like they're being subjected to a sermon. There's also a message about the importance of diversity and harmony, as a wide variety of animal species band together to help Marlin as he searches for his lost son.\r Finding Nemo is every bit as humorous as Monsters Inc., although some of the comedy is more low-key. Having experienced comedians like Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres as the lead voices helps immeasurably. Brooks, as is his forte, makes Marlin sound constantly beleaguered. DeGeneres is a hoot as the tang with no short term memory. Willem Defoe brings an initial whiff of the sinister to his part as Nemo's older, larger tankmate. Other voices include Alison Janney, Austin Pendleton, and Geoffrey Rush as a helpful pelican.\r Director Andrew Stanton has opted to animate some of the fish realistically, while using artistic license with others. The clownfish and hippo tang, for example, look almost identical to their real-life counterparts. The sea horses and turtles, however, have some of their rough edges smoothed out, making them cuter and more child-friendly. Overall, Finding Nemo is a treasure trove of visual splendor. From the opening scenes on the coral reef with Marlin taking up residence in his new anemone to the cheesy insides of Nemo's aquarium cage, the film is colorful and amazingly detailed. Every time I view a Pixar film, I am stunned at how much there is to see. Finding Nemo proves that the computer animators can do as much under water as above it.\r I wonder if Finding Nemo will fuel an upsurge in interest in salt water aquariums. To be sure, clowns are interesting fish to keep, but only for those with a little patience. Children expecting their pets to exhibit the characteristics of Marlin and Nemo will likely be disappointed. Nevertheless, ecological considerations aside, there's nothing to gripe about where Finding Nemo is concerned. Pixar has done it again, and, in the process, managed to salvage Disney's reputation \u2013 at least for a little longer."

      "text": "Wasn't it Disney which once claimed that life can be \"better down where it's wetter\" during The Little Mermaid's ocean-floor showtune `Under The Sea'? Well, that's certainly proved to be true. After all, Mermaid was the feature-'toon that shoved the Mouse House back on track, while Pixar's latest, a subaquatic epic which casts fish as its heroes, smashed box-office records Stateside to surpass The Lion King as America's biggest-ever animated feature.\r Conceived, co-written and directed by A Bug's Life helmer Andrew Stanton, Nemo doesn't take long to reveal why: it's a sparkling treasure trove of snappy comedy, smart characterisation, lush visuals and breakneck action.\r This fish's tale follows Marlin (Albert Brooks), a neurotic clownfish who's afraid to let his vulnerable son, Nemo (Alexander Gould), out of his sight lest he be gobbled up by one of the Great Barrier Reef's multitudinous predators. Understandable really, especially considering a harrowing face-slap of an opening that reveals how Marlin's wife and brood were massacred by a barracuda. During a school trip, however, Nemo is netted by a diver and whisked away from his ocean home. The distraught Marlin immediately goes in pursuit, reluctantly enlisting the help of Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a fish who suffers from short-term memory loss...\r It's become somewhat fashionable to praise family entertainment for being `dark'. After all, if it's `dark', then it must be okay for adults to like it. And Finding Nemo has its fair share of `dark' moments (one minute, Bruce, a vegetarian Great White, sobs that he never knew his father; the next, he's going wild at the scent of blood and launching himself at Marlin and Dory), but to describe it as such is missing the point. The reason why Finding Nemo is such a success is because it's layered.\r While Marlin and Dory take the episodic adventure route, Nemo is dropped into an aquarium in a dentist's office, where he encounters a collection of barely sane inmates, led by a fish named Gill (Willem Dafoe) who's obsessed with returning to the Big Blue. So Marlin's journey of self-discovery, in which he encounters monsters, turtles, jellyfish and the like, runs parallel to Nemo's coming of age under Gill's (mis)guidance as he takes part in a One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest-flavoured asylum-break.\r The moral message is satisfying and schmaltz-free and, as you'd expect from Pixar, the comedy is sharper than a swordfish's nose. Then there's the astounding visualisation of the undersea world, so breathtakingly detailed it could empty a scuba diver's airtank in a matter of seconds. But the loudest praise should go to DeGeneres, who makes the forgetful Dory a laugh-a-minute comedy sidekick, her quips timed to perfection. As Bruce the vegetarian shark's mantra goes, \"Fish are our friends.\" And Finding Nemo certainly makes sure we realise that.\r A spectacular comedy-adventure that's never less than totally immersive. The first TRUE Pixar masterpiece. Go fish!"

Plus, Thomas Newman's music score always knows how to pull on my heartstrings.\r Albert Brooks, from 'Taxi Driver' (1976), does some amazing vocal work as a concerned father looking for his missing son, Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould).
