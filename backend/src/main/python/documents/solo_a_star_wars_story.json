It wasn't a dramatic masterpiece but I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish. While Force Awakens and Last Jedi were far more polished, I had much bigger narrative and directorial issues with both than I did Solo. I thought the fan service peppered throughout was handled impeccably, Alden Ehrenreich did an uncanny job capturing young Harrison Ford's mannerisms as Solo, and Glover was superb as Lando. If you're a fan of the original trilogy do not let the polarizing views dissuade you from seeing this on a big screen and judge for yourself."

This movie is one of the best Star Wars films I've seen in a long while. I enjoyed it more than Rogue One (For real, it was a downer). In fact, the past three SW movies have been complete downers as we've seen characters killed off one-by-one, again and again. It's been pretty depressing.I think we needed this movie. It was fun. It was thrilling. It had that classic SW feel, and man, the aliens were incredibly well done as well as the sets and the effects.The cast is spot-on as well, and although I never thought anybody else could be Han, Alden Ehrenreich did a dang good job. Lando? Okay, Glover was chanelling Billy Dee pretty much. Chewie was finally more than just big hairy window dressing, and the rest of the characters did a bang up job with their respective roles.Man. I just cannot explain how happy I was walking out of the theater. And that reveal at the end?  I can't wait for the sequel.Do yourself a favor if you're a SW fan and ignore the fan hate.

Yeah, Aldenreich is no Ford, but he is a likable lead. The best part is the relationship between him and Chewie, totally natural. Also, this is probably the first time Chewbacca has been fully utilized. As practically everyone else has said, Glover is a terrific Lando Calrissian. The younger version of him is even more delightuflly egotistical. The MVP of new characters is Han's robot co-pilot. I won't spoil too much about her, but she may the most unique droid in Star Wars.I liked this but I do rank it behind the other recent SW films. (Though definitely leaps above the prequel trilogy.) The film does contain an overglut of characters and set changes. The ending is a bit subdued, too. There is one part of this film that will confuse those who never watched the Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels cartoon series. I mean I give the writers credit for maintaining the continuity of the canon, but it is at the disadvantage of the casual viewer. Lastly, the biggest problem of the film is how darkly shot most of the film is. The lighting doesn't even match the tone."

But if I'm to punish movies I don't like then its only fair I praise movies I do like. And I did have a really great time with this flick.It really is a Heist/Gangster film in a Space Opera setting. We see brilliant shots of the Corellian Slums, a muddy warzone on Mimban, and some really excellent sequences of the Falcon in space.The humor was much more subtle and appropriate than anything from the sequel films. The characters, though a little one-dimensional at times make much more sense. The empire is portrayed as vast and intimidating whilst also not having infinite reach. Callbacks and references to the other films and to the EU (surprisingly enough) occur often but they rarely stand out as forced.While the future of the franchise is pretty much a lost cause post-Endor, both of the side-stories have managed to seriously impress me despite extremely low expectations. If you're boycotting Disney for the travesties they've committed with Episodes 7 & 8 then I can understand not wanting to see another Disney-produced film. This idea cuts both ways however, if Lucasfilm start making Star Wars movies you actually like and you don't see them, it'll send the message that people really do want the adventures of MaRey Sue vs Cry-lo Ren and the Hitler Youth repeated every year for all time. Be consistent, or you'll never get the Star Wars universe you want to see."

      "text": "You are here probably wondering if Han Solo got emasculated and ruined as a character even more. The answer is a resounding yes. His name now has a origin that is lamer than anything you could imagine. He is alone when he signs up for the Empire, says his name is Han so the Empire names him Han Solo. He gets bossed around most of the movie by women, there is a disturbing dong to dong shower scene with Han and Chewbacca (no I 'm not kidding). The new droid  is a fem1nist from hell and the most annoying thing ever seen in Star Wars and Lando who gets more feminine throughout the movie loves it. Basically this is just another Kathleen Kennedy propaganda film where they strategically try to remove any masculinity from legacy characters. All women in the movie are more masculine than Han. They are all more intelligent and more confident than Han. Oh and yes there is a Darth Maul cameo that has no resolution and it's comical when he fired up a lightsaber for no reason. Enfys Nest is a 16 year old girl rebel who is basically Rey without the force, so even more ridiculous. Avoid if you liked Star Wars. Go see if you hate men and hated the original Star Wars and are glad to endorse the destruction of the franchise. Also highly recommended for kids if you want to damage your son and give him low self esteem. The only reason I didn't rate it a zero is most of these review sites consider scores like that \"trolling\". It deserves a 0 though. Star Wars is simply dead. Read the Thrawn Trilogy instead and just give up on Disney Star Wars."

      "text": "(87/100)Wow, I've never seen a fanbase THIS toxic. Not a single review that is under a 6 has valid arguments to why this movie was ''bad''. The only thing I'm seeing is: Kathleen Kennedy ruined Star Wars, SJW Propaganda and Disney ruining Star Wars. So lets get to why I liked it. Solo: A Star Wars Story is something new and refreshing. It's so much better than I expected. The story is amazing, Jon and Lawrence Kasdan have done an amazing job. Despite the movie having a directorial change it still feels very coherent and well put together. The movie was great fun all around. SPOILERS AHEAD. The reveal of Darth Maul (Sam Witwer/Ray Park) was surprising and it felt right. He fits right into the story and I really want to see those other 2 Solo movies to find out what happens next with the Crimson Dawn. The surprises of Beckett (Woody Harrelson) and Qi'ra (Emilia Clarke) turning on Han (Alden Ehrenreich) was an amazing twist. Alden Ehrenreich (Han Solo) is not what I expected, I expected it to be bad. He was great in the role as Han Solo and Lando was also excellently played by Donald Glover. Overall I was less divisive about Solo: A Star Wars Story than The Last Jedi and it was a very fun movie in general. Score by John Powell was also great, especially Enfys Nest's/the Savareen's theme."

I didn't watch any of the Solo trailers and I didn't read any news about the movie beforehand. This movie was made for the existing Star Wars fanbase and I enjoyed it because of that. I felt like TLJ was made to gather a new Star Wars fanbase while letting the past die, killing it if it has to.I have always had a difficult time figuring out exactly what it is about Star Wars that I love so much. There are so many elements to the movies, I'm not sure I can put my finger on just one of them. If I had to choose, I would say the movie's ability to take me to a galaxy far, far away is the core element. The Last Jedi didn't do that for me, but Solo did. I love the feeling of wonder and fantasy. The \"lived in\" environment, full of used machinery and living spaces, is ever present. We get a better feel for how the Empire has truly permeated its presence throughout the galaxy. We get to see how lawlessness reigns in some galactic territories. We get to see new and familiar alien species. We get to see planets that are mentioned in previous Star Wars films, but not seen in a movie until now. For the most part, I felt like I was in the Star Wars universe throughout this film. No, the film isn't perfect, but that's true of all the previous Star Wars films so far. I didn't feel like this movie was trashing Star Wars, it was merely building on what already exists. Considering the setbacks Lucasfilm faced during production, I think this movie turned out quite well. I never really wanted a movie about Han Solo, but I'm happy with what we got."

Han has none of the edgy cool that made people love him in 1977, he spends most of the movie being bullied by shrill women. Lando swishes and sashays through every scene, totally unlike the cool dude from Empire Strikes Back. The Kessel Run story gets wrecked too through the use of a lame \"shortcut\".

Emilia Clark is good in the role and Paul Bettany is good as the villain (even though he isn't in the movie for a majority of the runtime). Donald Glover is the most memorable out of the entire cast and steals the show in every scene. There is one big surprise in this film but unfortunately it feels like a setup for another film or a sequel. In any case, the surprise was amazing and I can't wait to see what they do next.

The humor was decent and did not always work, the fan service and the easter eggs were well dosed. The emotional moments usually do not work, because one is missing the reference to the figures. In addition, the film lacks tension, but that's the problem with a prequel. We know who will survive in any case. The supporting roles were very well staffed, especially Donald Glover stands out. I just had a problem with Emilia Clarke - she works in GoT, but here she did not make a good impression. For me, there was only one really disturbing and completely unnecessary scene - how Han Solo got its name. Facepalm.

The Star Wars hallmark of strange, humorous aliens in hilarious situations is intact.Of Alden Ehrenreich, well, he is not Harrison Ford any more than Roger Moore was Sean Connery.  He does a fine job, and that, more than anything, is the issue.  The role demands something very special, and Ehrenreich only hits that mark occasionally.  But to say that his performance ruins the film is hyperbole in the extreme.  Just more hater talk. And Emilia Clarke???  WOW...She is fantastic.  Thandie Newton is under utilized in the extreme but in a way that only makes sense if you really pay attention later in the film.  Pay attention to dialogue...In the end, Solo is solid.

For someone to say this movie is rotten is just laughable to me.  The look of the movie alone is worth the price of admission.  Fortunately you get so much more.  This is the funniest Star Wars movie, but still a very action packed movie.  I\u2019ve heard some people say it had \u201cslow\u201d parts.  I guess, but I think some of my favorite moments were just hanging out on the Falcon, shooting the breeze for a few minutes with these characters I love.  The moments where i could just be allowed to float in this world without the story being crammed at me like sometimes it is in blockbuster movies, were wonderful.  The beginning is a little rocky, but 15 mins in and it starts to find its footing.  Halfway through the second act I felt like I was inside an expanded universe comic.  It was really a fun time.  I think this movie is going to age really well. It has some scenes in it which are the best of any SW movie, even the original trilogy.  Don\u2019t listen to the haters.  This is a quality adventure that was really needed.  I haven't had this much fun in a movie in a long time.  One of my favorites immediately and it expands the universe in great ways."

Boredom begone!(I'm not a huge fan of Star Wars)Other Star Wars films typically become extremely boring with just explosions and lasers filling the screen. If more Star Wars films contained more smaller scaled emotionally charged battles between characters (like VaderVsLuke, Obi-WanVsAnakin), I could get behind more of them. Solo: A Star Wars Story brings the franchise a step closer to the best aspects of Star Wars. Now my rankings for the films are: EmpireSB > RevengeotS > SOLO. BOOYAH."

(and to give CinemaSins a run for their buck)\u201dThis is how most of this so called \u201cFanbase\u201d works,whenever one of these movies comes out (*POP* I liked Last Jedi).But when we talk about Solo A Star Wars Story,I can say that it was a fun ride,aside from the Development Hell this movie went through. Going into it,I was expecting a Heist Movie with the same veins of a Steven Soderbergh one,and it was that,with some haunting places,a John Powell score that never disappoints and (almost) great casting.You may want to cool down your expectations if you want to see a good story with the big spectacle we usually expect from a franchise like Star Wars.From beginning to end,it just felt like a great big action sequence (of 2h15) that takes place in several places with a story that's easy enough to follow,given that the movie doesn't know when to spend its time on either the friendship between Solo and Chewie or the big heist with Woody Harrelson as Beckett.Speaking of the actors,I thought Alden Ehrenrich could have been good as Solo...If the script didn't give him some of the most cringey Fanbase moments of all time.\u201cI hate you\u201d \u201cI know\u201dAlthough the secondary cast was a better ensemble than I thought it was going to be.Emilia Clarke as Qi\u2019 Ra? Good!Jon Favreau as Rio? Kind of annoying,but still good.Paul Bettany as Evil Vision? Boy...But Childish Gambino AKA Donald Glover as Lando Carlissian STEALS the movie.Not only that,but also the massive wonderment of a score by John Powell that, just like Ice Age The Meltdown and Robots,makes it for another standout that carries the movie,accompanied by a courageous theme by John Williams.Oh,and big special effects and one of the greatest title card appearances of all-time (Thor Ragnarok and Guardians Of The Galaxy BEWARE).You can call this the \u201cFun Star Wars\u201d if you go into it with the right amount of expectations. Don't expect an Empire Strikes Back,but also don't expect a Rogue One,although a better movie than the prequels you can. All in all,sure,never tell him the odds...At some point."

      "text": "I actually liked this movie a lot but it do has its flaws. For one the script is kinda off since it just doesn't feel special. Its simple but its not unique and there are times in the film where the plot just feels messy and some of the characters are just there for no reason. It feels like the movie is just there, it may be a fun ride but at the end there's nothing new to it. For one, this movie is better than the TLJ and I suggest that you watch it because it's actually good. It may not be a masterpiece,but it's a fun ride and some of the scenes are just really well executed. Some criticise the pacing but I could say its fine. So overall this movie is just good but not great. But this is just my opinion."
