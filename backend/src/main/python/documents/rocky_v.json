      "text": "I know it's controversial, but I believe Rocky V is the best Rocky movie since Rocky II. They tried a lot of new things, and payed off a lot of things from the previous movies. If they were to do another Rocky fights someone in the ring movie it would have been what we already have seen. Instead they try something new and give us a movie were he trains someone instead of Rocky being trained. I won't spoil anything, but it doesn't go the way you think. The end fight was original and something we haven't seen in the series. Although that's were I will start with my negatives about the movie. I like what the did at the end, but I thought it was drawn out for way too long, and it got to the point of being unrealistic. There was also some really weird editing choices at the end. Also some of the acting was not good at all. Other than that I really enjoy Rocky V, and believe it's a good way to close the main series."

Yes, the previous two installments were a little corny, but they were genuine fun. The biggest issue I have with this one is that Rocky doesn't end up fighting in the ring."

Now I know everyone wanted to see Rocky traing then in tue ring which could have easily beendone but they decided to go in a differnt direction. In Rocky one he was a loan shark with no money this movie returns Rocky to his roots and \"the Duke\" even says Rocky is a street fighter which he was. The point of the movie was what Adrian says in the street he's not Mickey and Tommy is not Rocky because he doesn't hhave his heart. The best line is when pauly gets knocked downbin the bar and Rocky says  You knocked him down why dont you try and knock me down!\" And Mickey telling him he has one more round and he didn't hear a bell speaks to Rocky's heart and it gives me goose bumps. This movie was panned by critics but what do they know? In closing if you dont watch every previous film then it wont have the same impact."

I see where he was trying to go with this movie, but I think  it could have been better.  Maybe I would have rated this higher if I didn't have the previous movies to compare it too.\rI rate Rocky the best, followed by Rocky II. Rocky III was OK Rocky IV was a little far fetched especially the ending. Rocky V did nothing for me."

      "text": "live through your eyes..Rocky VIt was better and more interesting episode of Balboa's life than the previous one, but it still doesn't make it good enough to invest in it. Rocky V is fast paced than the previous ones and seems to have material enough to run for around 100 minutes unlike its previous installments even though the content is predictable and familiar to the audience. Sylvester Stallone may not be able to attract the audience with its storyline but he surely puts enough gravitas on his character and also plays it with all the conviction to always let the audience ask for more of it and root for it and cheer for it. Rocky V is not nearly redefining it or justifying the originality and the purity of it but it is made for the fans and delivers enough action sequences and huge dramatic scene to capture their attention even though it still is poorly choreographed and repetitive."

Ok, the music is bad and the story has some weaknesses, especially the plot twists and some behaviours are not convincing. But finally this part is a bit different to the other Rockies, because the focus is more Tommy Gun and Rocky as a coach. The fighting scenes are bad as usual, but the street fighting was a nice idea. Also I like, when the movies are showing some background information about the boxing business."

Along with the addition of Rocky Jr. And Rocky's prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, the movie receives some much-needed fuel, and ties up the Rocky movies pretty well (even if they cheated and made \"Rocky Balboa\" 16 years later)."

      "text": "The weakest movie in the Rocky franchise. It is more of a misstep. For example: Can you summarize the story of the movie so others would be hyped or interested to see this movie? Yes without a doubt. This is an indicator as everything in this movie can work if done correctly or with a different approach. Lets start with the story: Rocky is back at the USA after the events of Rocky 4. His health has however suffered terribly. Because he was fooled by an accountant he lost all his wealth and is back were he began as his health prevents him from boxing. He decides to become a trainer like Mickey and meets a young aspiring boxer named Tommy Gunn starting to train him. There are also side stories about his family but I stop here as more would ruin the story (Yes, many will claimed it is already ruined by default). From this alone it looks like an awesome movie. It fails in delivering the impact, emotions and characters. It is like doing stuff on a to do list without (enough) care or knowing how it works. Even Sylvester Stallone did not like the movie. It was nominated for 7 or 8 golden raspberries if I remember correctly. The characters again are diluted or weakened by the script. For example there are great scenes that show the potential but then there are others that feel like poorly scripted attempts to get it over. I think I am moving in circles so lets get to my final rating. Overall this is a misstep that had great potential but failed to deliver. Not near the worst movies of all times but also not recommendable. May be compared to Star Trek 5 as it is also the worst in the series but had also great potential. Bonus knowledge: The mentioned Rocky Marciano (Rocco Francis Marchegiano) is a boxer you defiantly should know. He is the only heavyweight champion that finished his career undefeated (49-0). He was not only an excellent boxer but also spent his money the smart way and stopped a potential comeback when he realized he was not as good as before. Remark: Rocky is not inspired from him. Chuck Wepner inspired Sylvester Stallone for Rocky."

      "text": "The Rocky franchise has carried itself in a particular fashion that has made it popular and profitable. I feel like Rocky V strayed from that fashion. It claims to be an even further reach back into Rocky's roots as a street fighter and that that was a prominent part of his character all along when it really was never established  in any of the other films except vaguely in the first Rocky. There is merit in the story, and a lot of heart involved in the struggle Rocky has in salvaging what's left of his life and providing for his family. It was a new direction that was just too far for me. Were it standing on its own I may think better of it but considering its prequels and sequel, this is the runt."

For the whole film we won't even see a real fight in the ring. For me, an average film that I just don't understand why it was made and I only recommend it to fans of the series."

The strength of an Italo-American fighter who is white, giving, and kind to his wife, children, and friends has been the subject of several movies. But, this Rocky V somewhat made me think of the tragic tale of Joe Louis, one of the most well-known boxers of all time, who was forced to return to the ring to face a young and powerful Rocky Marciano. Louis was no longer considered to be the person who was unstoppable during the 1940s; instead, he returned as a result of mysteriously appearing debts that forced him to battle for his life."
