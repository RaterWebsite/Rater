      "text": "This is a bit of a Groundhog Day type film, although its not exactly that but it has the romance element of it and the time moving element, of course. Its cheesy and sentimental but I thought it was surprisingly good. The characters are likeable enough and there was a nice mix of touching moments and amusing moments. Its an easy watch, its not a complicated film and I didn't think it was too over the top. I think it worked well as Rafe Spall plays such a bewildered character (Teddy). It's hard not to feel sorry for him, trying to figure out what's going on. Its a fun watch, with perhaps one or two serious messages behind it. Yes, I'd recommend this film."
