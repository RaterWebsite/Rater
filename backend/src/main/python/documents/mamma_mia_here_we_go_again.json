      "text": "This felt like a disney movie amped up to 11, and this isn't a good thing. The  whole \"fall in love after just meeting\" is so old that even disney doesn't do it anymore. Most characters are shallow and very under-developed. The script feels very childish, if that's the right word for it. Can't tell you how many times i rolled my eyes, at the stupid and corny things said by those characters. The amount of unnecessary sub-plots could have been taken out, cutting the movie to at least 90 minutes, Cher's character and plot line comes to mind.  It certainly could have been more straight forward, to make it a better movie.Being a lover of music, i have to admit, some songs are very catchy and good to listen to. The performances are good and convincing, but unfortunately this movie suffers a bit with Meryl Streeps absence, although that point is kind what drives the movie forward.I wasn't expecting too much of this movie, but wasn't expecting it to be a combination of a live action disney movie and a mexican soap opera."

If you compare the \"Past Tense\" actors to the real characters they don't look the same at all, and the show haven't done nothing to make them look as they were described in Mamma Mia \"1\". Overall it  just seemed sloppy and weird to me, and it's a shame to the real Mamma Mia. Only positive is that all the old actors were there. (Too obviously only made for money)"

I did not feel the same here, I think that if Meryl loses a bit of that energy and Lily James, however charismatic, is not enough. There are few new songs (mostly forgettable) and the previously used songs are widely used. The trailer already shows you everything that happens and there is no surprise. Cher brings absolutely nothing and appears in the last 5 minutes. Donna's relationship with the 3 men seemed very forced and rushed. I did not like. I expected much more."

Songs are just re-hashed from the original, with nothing different to make it watchable. Actors are flat-out incompetent, especially the younger ones and Cher (give her the Razzie already). Script is... well, there isn't one. It adds NOTHING new to the original story. We still have no idea who the father is and no new information that could make this go forward in any kind of way. Streep is in this as a freakin' GHOST for the very last musical number. There is NO reason for this to suck as much as it did. I expected average, at the very least boring. But this is an insult to ANYONE, even fans of the original will be pissed by how this brings NOTHING new and barely makes any sense.Avoid this movie. Re-watch the original, but please do not give this movie any credit for doing anything."

With the help of only one of her three fathers Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Sophie does everything in her power to give the best grand opening party ever. Yet, for the first time in all her life, she has never felt closer to her mother Donna (Meryl Streep).While Here We Go Again is such as silly and absurd as its predecessor, the truly best parts of the sequel, aren\u2019t the sequel aspects at all, but the prequel aspects. The majority of Here We Go Again. showcases a young Donna (Lily James) and how she came about to Greece and how she came to meet (and fall in love) with the three influential men in her life, including a young Harry (Hugh Skinner), an young Bill (Josh Dylan) and a young Sam (Jeremy Irvine).While Here We Go Again is surely meant to be Sophie\u2019s story, especially given Sophie\u2019s pregnancy with Sky\u2019s (Dominic Cooper) baby, the move never quite allows Sophie to being the star. Always in the shadow of her mother and what an amazing woman and presence she was, both in a narrative sense and reality sense, Seyfried\u2019s Sophie is constantly overshadowed by both Meryl Streep\u2019s Donna, and now, Lily James\u2019 Donna. Both Donna\u2019s are shining examples of just how exuberant, vibrant and lively Donna really is; a soul who leaves her friends on a whim, travels the world with no regrets, and gets into bed with any cute man that puts in any effort to sweep her off her feet. Whoops!Its in Here We Go Again where the audience can truly appreciate the amazing absence of the amazing Meryl Streep and her interpretation of Donna, and James is more than up to the task and does an incredible job of brining to life a beloved character.One of the more disappointing features of Here We Go Again is the void of Streep on-screen. While much of the marketing and promotional advertising promises Streep in the newest film, her return is not for quite long, and overshadowed greatly by her mother, Ruby, played by the queen of glam and glory, Cher. While the queen of disco only shows up very late in the film, she does what Cher does best, providing the film with its fair share of sass, attitude and divine diva-ness that capsules the film into queen like status, yas!While Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again isn\u2019t the most spectacular musical you\u2019ll watch, especially after such genre-defining work on La La Land, you can sure bet that this latest instalment of the popular ABBA pop group\u2019s discography, will one a huge hit amongst women, mothers and inspire an onslaught of mother/daughter dates for the remainder of summer 2018."

All I remembered about it was that Pierce Brosnan could not sing to save his life and that the plot was terminally silly. This sequel/prequel is carried by Lily James, a British actress who first impressed me as Churchill's young secretary in \"Darkest Hour.\" She lights up every scene in which she acts. She has singing, dancing, and acting chops to burn. Cher, at the ripe old age of 71, appears toward the end of the movie. The plot again is terminally silly, but the movie is saved by the sense that a bunch of actors who genuinely care for each other are having an extraordinary amount of fun together."

      "text": "I'm an ABBA fan, I love their songs but I was never happy with the results of Mamma Mia, although I know the play is a phenomenon. The truth is that the film didn't leave me satisfied, partly because I'm not a fan of musicals in which all the scenes are built based on the musical numbers. I hate when they only talk for a brief moment, they say a few words and seconds later they are already singing and dancing. I really hate that and both films are like that.I know it's a bit weird that I cannot enjoy the songs I like that way but it just didn't worked with me.This sequel doesn't invent something new or different and it doesn't want to do it either. It's simply an extension of the first film and what it had already done and that's not necessarily a bad thing but it's not necessarily a good thing either, especially since it wasn't a necessary sequel to begin with. But it's already done so complaining about that is an exercise in futility.I admit the change of structure in the story by interspersing the narratives of the past and the present helps the film and shake things a bit.Lily James does a good job as a young Donna and to me she's the only one that leaves a true impression of the cast of that part of the story. While the other part of the cast, ''the famous ones'' they're simply working at half gas, without striving at any time.Cher's addition doesn't really contribute to anything but it works. At least I've gotta say the film doesn't lie to you, it's practical and simple, it's obviously aimed to a certain type of audience, especially those who enjoyed the first one, so of course they will enjoy this one as well, that's why I give it credit. It's not a film that I'm interested in seeing again but its quality is good enough to excel what is necessary."

      "text": "a brimful of nothing..Mamma! Mia Here We Go Again1 And A Half Out Of 5Mamma! Mia Here We Go Again is a commercial plot driven musical sequel that depicts the past of the protagonist Donna which was kept hidden under the shadow in the first installment. It is certainly better than the first one; the reason to that is the sincerity that may not breed the essential crisp out of it but appropriately respects the tenderness of it, but unfortunately that's not saying a lot. It is rich on technical aspects like its up-beating and far better songs, decent background score and breezy costume design and on the other hand fails completely on choreography (which is disappointing considering the genre of the feature), cinematography and editing. Few songs and alluring visuals and locations are the only high points of the feature. The script is blunt, naive, cheesy and immature at times that follows an indefinite structure that collapses before it even builds itself up. The overstuffed characters with their textbook sub-plot, is one of the dullest recipe in this mishap of misconception. The screenplay by Ol Parker is raw and under-cooked to create any impact on its self-created and pretentious emotions. And whilst Parker fails on offering an appropriate trajectory to its characters, it decently holds on to its role on executing the sequence with conviction. The performance is something that itches down the throat throughout the course of it since the cast seem to have been enjoying too much to persuade the audience for a second look. Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is more of a question than an answer to its predecessor as it's a brimful of nothing, where after the dust settles, there is still not a single piece of craft to explore in it for it takes place to create a satisfying closure for the makers and not the viewers."

The duet between Meryl and Amanda is incredible, very touching and probably you're going to cry a lot in that part.Cher singing \"Fernando\" is probably the best musical moment of the movie. I mean, Cher should be in every single movie in this world. All the cast are great but when the Goddess of Pop enter in the movie we just want to see more.Rosie and Tanya are the funniest characters in the movie, the young and the oldest ones. And Tanya have the greatest lines on Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.\"Super Trouper\" singing by Cher and Meryl Streep with the backing vocals of all the cast. Seeing this two having a song together is like heaven on the earth.The Screenplay is not gold, but it's funny and entertain the public. This is not a Oscar material film but it's probably the funniest movie of this decade."

All of this is peppered with plenty of Abba songs, some of which are repeated from the original and some of which I've never heard (not a big ABBA fan). Thru it all is a bright sense of fun and romance. The staging and costumes aren't as dazzling as the original, but there's still plenty of spirited joy.

Although Lily James does a good job as the young Donna, her exploits with the three young men just aren't that interesting.  They used all the really good Abba songs in the first film, so they wind up with a lot of B sides here.

The acting from everyone was good. Even the new cast who play the younger versions of the older characters were pretty solid. Especially Lily James who I thought was crazy good.What took me by surprise is how sad and really tragic it got. I can tell it struck a chord with the audience by emotionally engaging them. The first movie was about becoming an adult and leaving your home. The second movie focus on moving on after a love one passed. I\u2019m glad these films kept that formula. Still, It\u2019s not all doom and gloom.However, there are issues.The story jumps from present day with Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) and the past with Donna (in 1977), which at times made it confusing when it keeps cutting back and forward. For me, it wasn't well executed.There\u2019s a scene where it tries to be heartbreaking with Pierce Brosnan looking through old photographs of Donna while singing solo. No musical number or anything, just briefly singing. What was intended to be an emotional scene, instead made me cringe in my seat. He\u2019s singing is the reason why. I will give credit for trying in terms of acting.Of course the cast got much older since 10 years and it shows. They tried to make a joke about it, and it's painfully unfunny. The audience didn't laugh, neither did I. Time has been most cruel to them.Despites those complaints and praise, it holds no weight to anything. After awhile you soon realize the filmmakers never set out to make a masterpiece or thinking piece. While yes, some of the cast are not best singers (mostly the males) or dancers, but the only thing you have to say is \u201cwho cares\u201d. This is pure entertainment with heart. Elevating on enjoyment and most importantly having a good time. While not quite uplifting and lacking some of the energy from the first, but hey. The audience though - Uniting the gays and middle aged mum type of crowd since 2008.Overall rating: Take a chance on this one!"

I would have liked it so much better if the new movie followed  Donna's diary from the first movie and the music had a much fuller sound.  The timeline wasn't right in #2 and would have been so easy to fix with the way the characters were setup.  Donna meets Harry in Paris where they don't have sex and then follows her to Greece where they do have sex.  It's not hard to do.  They could have had the whole Waterloo song and dance scene with her at a Paris music shop where he buys her the guitar, starts playing Waterloo, takes off his shirt for part of the sale, and people passing by join in the song.  Even having a bust of Napoleon on the sidewalk would have been so easy.  He could follow her to Greece, sees her after Sam's left, asks to see the island, and it would have fit right into the diary entry from #1.  Since it was an \"oh what a night\" sort of diary entry for Donna, it shouldn't have had any of the Harry is really gay overtones to it.  When Donna is in Greece, she should have spent more time with Sam seeing the whole island since he was her main guy.  They would talk about the hotel idea and him sketching the plans for it.  They totally skipped that.  Bill doing a boat race in Greece was a better link to the actual diary, but it still opted to not include much of the relative on the Greece mainland for who Donna would later work for and name Sophie after.  They could have had such great scenes of them sailing around the island and actually being on the island where they have their \"oh what a night\" experience.  So much of the music in the movie is a cappella or minimal accompaniment.  Abba music needs to have a full sound.  The lip syncing of Cher was really bad.  They could have done so much more with her character as well.  Dancing Queen seemed to have solos with the chorus of singers heavily muted.  Please NO!  Mamma Mia! needs to be high energy with a strong music track to go with the vocals.  If the diary timeline had been fixed and the music done with higher energy, I would have loved it as much or more as the first one.  I can even enjoy Pierce Brosnan's singing with a good sound track to back him up."

Playing young Donna, the role played in adult hood by Meryl Streep in the first movie, Lily James is startling, beautiful, incandescent and an excellent actor.Another surprise to me was Amanda Seyfried who had never impressed me before in the many movies she has made. In this film she looked different, more sparkling and more realThe biggest surprise for me was Cher! Not that she stole the film for the 15 minutes she was in it but because the first 5 minutes she looked bad, was dressed very unlike Cher and seemed very stiff singing \u201cFernando\u201d but the last 10 minutes she was dressed as the Cher we know and stole all the closing credits from the rest of the cast, including Streep.A major surprise for me was that I love musicals, especially the old M-G-M, Busby Berkeley choreographed, Astaire & Rogers, Gene Kelley type of movies as along with songs and dances they usually had a good book. \u201cMamma Mia 2\u201d drove me crazy with a song every two minutes consisting of second tier ABBA songs plus putting in the 3-4 hits that were used in the first \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d Most songs were sung for absolutely no reason except they were written by ABBA.\u201cMamma Mia!

Despite the fact that the songs (from ABBA) are better incorporated to the film's story, ironically, the best parts of the film is where the character's don't sing. We see that Sophie (a plucky Amanda Seyfried) is trying to open up a hotel in honor of her mother's memory. Slight spoiler alert (even though it is very early in the film), but yes, Donna (Meryl Streep) has passed away. We're never given an explanation as to how she died, just that, she is no longer with our main characters, and that's a way to kick-start the movie's plot. We do get constant flashbacks to Donna's younger days (where she is played by a likeable Lily James), and how she traveled across different islands and met many handsome men who she spends some romantic times with. The singing done by James, as well as her on-screen male love interests, is done well, and as I said above, the songs are better incorporated to the film's story... but I found myself more invested when they would just sit an talk. I know that might be a bore for some, but I felt that the characters were really progressing just through dialogue alone. The movie constantly cuts back and forth between past and present, developing Donna's character even more, and how she met her three exes. Unfortunately, this made me feel that the overall storytelling of the film was very uneven. Time and time again, we're being forced to get emotionally invested in these two different timelines, when they're cutting back and forth to different situations, so there is no time to care. I found myself getting utterly frustrated with the bland archetype character that Andy Garcia was playing. What's the purpose of his role? Just to be utterly handsome and flirt with Donna's two best friends, that's it. All in all, this maybe a \"feel-good\" film, but I found myself feeling the exact opposite. A waste of emotional investment despite some strong work from a talented cast."

At the same time that Sophie go struggling in present time, we see Donna's young adult life, how she met all of the Sophie's fathers and her relationship with them, we see a lot of Donna adventures with her friends and love, so as her disappointments. Directed and Written by OL Parker.We accompany two stories in two different times in parallel, present and past, these transitions normally worked out well, but there were some few times that it didn't felt much naturally between those two times. The story of Donna is very nice told in here, since the moment that she graduated the movie made it clear what she thought about the world and how she wanted her life to be like, during her relationship with other characters we can get to know her a little bit more each time, how kind she is and what she sees around things, they did a good job in evolving the character that we already know, or better building up to that one that Meryl did 10 years ago. The story of Sophie also works, it just isn't so interesting as Donna, but like they are mixing with the time, the thing about her moments is also a lot about the parents, wich was definely fun, how they hold up with their lifes is a interesting moment, there are some drama moments that i don't think that it worked in the best way, but mostly it was good.The story brings discussions about maternity, how big is the connection with a mother even after a death, it did got some emotional moments where it did speak a lot.A lot of the movie could be taken out into clips of music, like more than 50 per cent of it, it could be cutted out and be watched just by itself, and i gotta say that must of these clips are great, like damn, really great, some of these are so fun that can easily put your spirit up, some of these clips are completely fun, a completely delight to watch, not necessary are the most creatives ever, but the happiness that you see in the face of every single one that are in those dancing and singing moments are contagious. Lily James singing is fantastic, she is a great singer, everybody that got the shot to do some singing moments did a good job, the songs aren't original for the movie, bu they are very good, the creativity aren't very big in most of the clips, but they still pumped my spirit up, so it was good. The dancing sequences was a lot of fun and much of it because how much it did contagious me and how much different people was there, there were all kind of people there together and having fun, that was fantastic.Lily James singing is fantastic, i'm glad that they are keeping her in those movies that requires that her character to sing, she as a singer really heat's my heart, in the acting part she is also very good, she could pass me the suffering in some moments, or the strange parts that she didn't knew what was happening as well, physically she is great, wich was nice in the dancing moments wich happened a lot with her, where she did a great job not just in the singing part, but also working with her expressions while doing it so together with the dance, she was fantastic. Amanda Seyfried had some really good emotional moments. Christine Baranski and Julie Walters are still very fun and a very nice duo with chemistry, so as the actresses that portray the younger verse of them, wich are Jessica Keenan Wynn and Alexa Davies, they did a very nice job and i completely bought that they were the same person. The 3 fathers so as they younger selves was also very nice, all of them did a good job, they were all fun and all sang well.This movie fixed one problem that it had in the 2008 one, wich is the filter, that yellow and ugly filter is gone, and now we have a beutiful cinematography to see the island and the colors in a much better way. There were some sequences where the green screen was easily noticiable.This one is definely better than the first one, it is so fun that will bring your spirit up, playing the songs from ABBA with some good moves and a very nice singing, there are some moments that are boring, some unnecessary telling, but overall it is a lot of fun."

      "text": "To be quite honest, I didn't care much for the first film. However, this sequel managed to rope me in with the seemingly amped up effort put into it. It seemed like they cared a lot more this time around. The musical numbers were fun, well choreographed and sung, many of the jokes landed, and that cast was very game, with Lily James and Cher being highpoints. Sure, it's not Shakespeare, but nobody should go in with that expectation. If you're looking to be entertained and not have to think too hard, you'll have fun being able to avoid the world for two hours."

The \"young Donna\" kept telling about how short life is and she wanted to make some memories, it's cool, brave and I appreciate that. However, I don't really love all the songs. I mean it's good, but kinda boring, it's all on a type"

      "text": "It was a good movie, not better than the original one.I was bored by the fact that after a song, 2 minutes of plot comes on, and then another song, every damn time.I know it's a musical, but they abused the quantity of songs, and also the fact they used the greatest ABBA songs on the first one, left them with not some great hits for this second one.I enjoyed the history of Donna on her young ages, but I wish they hadn't pick that storyline for Meryl Streep. Killing Donna for me, wasn't a great idea. I don't know if Meryl could act for the entire movie or what, but with her being alive, the plot could potentially be really much better.What I liked the most, was watching a movie with that great cast 10 years later, still fresh."

      "text": "This sequel/prequel/disaster contains some recycled songs (performed better this time) mixed in with deeper ABBA cuts.  Unfortunately, that's the only reason to watch this film.Better singers were brought on board but again we're forced to listen to the first movie's cast attempt (and fail) to sing.Many story points of the first film are retconned.  There are plot turns that don't even make sense.  This appears to have been done to shoehorn in some of the songs and get the \"feels\" desired by the writers.Do not attempt to make this movie fit in with the first.  Do not attempt to think about the movie very hard.I cannot believe it took three writers to turn out this inconsistent mess of a film."

      "text": "A rare sequel that supercedes its original in all aspects: more colorful, emotionally packed with joys and sadness, and better screenplay with more heavy weight stars added into the cast. The trailer intendedly feature songs already presented in the first movie, but when you immerse yourself into the movie, you will find that ABBA still has much more hits that you could remember. The only disappointment is that Meryl Streep has minimal screen time, but this is how the plot means to be when you finished the whole movie; her debut in the movie is precisely nice and placed at the best part of the movie. My top movie for 2018."
