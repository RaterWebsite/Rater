      "text": "When will it occur to Wanda(Rachel Weisz) that she's dating a man who is eternal, like a vampire? According to the narrator of the origin story, the Claus family stopped aging, and if the Santa Claus myth came of age during the nineteenth century, that makes Fred at least two centuries old. Shackled by the need to deliver a \"family-friendly\" movie, \"Fred Claus\" conceals the nefarious side of Nick(Paul Giamatti), who is a vampire in the business sense of the word(sucking the blood of the working class; the elves), and is probably having an affair with Charlene(Elizabeth Banks). When the two brothers engage in a tussle, you'll wish it was fisticuffs, and that edgy actors like Vince Vaughn and Giamatti had the freedom to hurl some expletives instead of snowballs at each other. Santa's toy factory and village is a forced labor camp. \"Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus,\" as the song goes, sounds like a veiled threat. Santa instructs his DJ(Ludacris) to play this song repeatedly because it's used as a form of mind control. Against their will, the elves need to meet their yearly quota. In the Nazi labour camps, women were employed to organize the Jewish children. In this light, take a closer look at Charlene and her control over the \"little people\"(\"midget\" is a slur, I'm told). Actually, \"Fred."

The movie is so predictable that 20 minutes into the movie you've pretty much guessed the upcoming plot and have figured out how it will end. Every Christmas theme and dysfunctional family cliche is explored and poorly executed. There were some well behaved children in the theater watching the sneak preview with me, and they looked pretty bored as well."

      "text": "A surprising movie... I expected a slapstick, irreverent slap at the long standing institution of Christmas, Santa and all things associated with one of the few events that still draws people together in celebration of a common ideal. The film does justice to the concept that there is good in the world, and that giving is the central theme of Christmas. Vaughn, Giamatti and Spacey are excellent in their respective roles. As a summary... at times funny, mostly touching. A good family film and great addition to the Christmas genre. A nice surprise."

I did not think it was that funny, but she sure did! Bring your children to this, and enjoy a heart warming movie! Anyone who disliked this story that was there opinion, but this is mine! I know you will all have different opinions, but the best thing i look for while watching a movie with my family, is seeing my children happy! that is what Christmas is all about! My son who is 14 said it was good! I was happy to hear that cause since he is a teenager, he doesn't like going any where with us, but we all personally enjoyed it!"
