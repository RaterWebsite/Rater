Insidious 3 relies on jump scares and not so much on the creepy, disturbing terror that the 1st movie employed so well. Not only that, but the trailer gives away A LOT of the jump scares that the movie uses, so you'd know what to expect in this particular scene. It just ruined a good chunk of the movie.

One scene in particular will actually keep you sitting still until it finishes, involving a lead teen played convincingly by Stefanie Scott, lying on her bedroom floor and looking adjacent to a pair of clawed feet walking toward her from the other side of the bed. The 3rd installment in the franchise is actually a lot closer to the 1st one, despite it being a debut from Leigh Whannell, rather than horror veteran James Wan.

Thankfully first time director Leigh Whannell knocks it out of the park. This very well might be the best of the series.\r Some well-crafted creepiness does a good job of setting up tension early on. There are a few effective jump scares to be found here that are setup by ominous pacing and uncomfortable atmosphere. Things do get noticeably less scary during the movies final act, almost as if it's burning out, but the film still goes strong thanks to the fantastic story and characters.\r The cast here is incredible. Their characters are actually well fleshed out and feel like real people. It makes it easy to care about them and the conflict. A rarity in modern horror films. That's this movie's real strength. The family drama and watching returning heroine \"Elise\" (the fantastic Lin Shaye) overcome her fears and turn into a confident protector help add a little bit of heart to the horror. Returning characters \"Specs and Tucker\" help to bring in some of the humor the previous two films had. Although those elements are kept much lighter this time around. It keeps itself mostly straight-faced throughout.\r It might not terrify you or keep you up at night, but it will certainly provide some creepy thrills and a story that will keep you watching. It's a very satisfying sequel/prequel with ideas that make it feel fresh amongst all of the other horror movies that clog up all of the senses lately. It's an excellent horror movie, and one that makes me excited for any future this series might have.\r I give this movie a 9.2/10."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "2spoopy4me 2spoopy4me 2spoopy4me 2spoopy4me 2spoopy4me 2spoopy4me 2spoopy4me 2spoopy4me 2spoopy4me  2spoopy4me2spoopy4me 2spoopy4me 2spoopy4me 2spoopy4me2spoopy4me"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "AWESOME ONE ...........

It's another haunting story with a teenager (Stefanie Scott) who's terrorized by an evil presence. Psychic Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye) is thrown in the mix for continuity. The ingredients are typical: ominous music, dark hallways, ghoulish specters and jump scares. There were 2 or 3 genuine jolts, but the rest is just fearsome atmosphere and mild suspense. Nothing original or particularly frightening."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Flaws from the past might still haunt Insidious, but this chapter of the old clairvoyant and new tormented souls proves to be adequately as well as intimately harrowing. A scare is much like a joke, tell it too many times and it will lose its charm. The third chapter of Insidious aim to repeat the success of the original with new characters and old proven methods of distributing chill. It has different atmosphere than previous rural haunting plus screeching hymn, which is a nice change of pace. At times it might revert back to repetitive gimmicks, but ultimately the capable cast led by Lin Shaye as they witness the perilous yet private story of a haunted girl manage to fright and fascinate.\r Quinn Brenner (Stefanie Scott) is saddened by the loss of her mother. Out of desperation she seeks Elise (Lin Shaye) to make unworldly contact. Elise is reluctant to help the troubled girl as she is distraught by her own problems. Though unwilling she still senses that an entity follows Quinn, but it is the farthest thing from her mother. While this premise is similar to The Conjuring, or others of the genre, it still works simply because the characters in predicament are likeable.\r Lin Shaye is very good on drawing sympathy, she looks fragile yet her on-screen compassionate nature is infectious. She also has a way to convey dread as a sort of more neighborly psychic instead of outright doomsayer. The new cast of Brenner family is also presentable. Stefanie Scott as Quinn is believable as an ordinary teen girl, with her typical girl issues and aspirations. The way she might seem plain, not a scream queen, is actually a boon to the movie as she's so much more relatable.\r Dermot Mulroney as Sean, Quinn's father is a great choice. He appears convincing as a father, especially as a single parent who must deal with raising two kids and now the addition of invasive entity. The chemistry between the two as father-daughter is solid, while other supporting characters build up the suspense or deliver a glint of humor between the dark days.\r It all comes down to the how horrifying this third chapter is. The set-up for horror is exceptionally done for the majority of the film, at several scenes it has some clever ways or perspectives to raise the thrill. However, it's still plagued by the same flaws of the franchise, such as resorting to screaming jump scares or it might lose steam as it goes further like the original. These rehearsed stuffs are admittedly have worn out their welcome, whether they persistently linger of not.\r What really nails the horror is the victim, Quinn, as she is gradually gnawed by this malicious existence. In an analogy of a young woman abused, both physically and emotionally, she is shown of losing herself bits by bits. It has a bit of oriental touch as some scenes reminded me of Japanese thriller, and they work very well in tandem with confident acting of the cast. It\u2019s much easier to invest to their ordeal as it looks so personal.\r Before the story Lambert family, there is a tale of breathlessly unfortunate lady. Familiar her story may be though the private display of her trial is suitably eerie."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Meh.

Leigh Whannell has a good eye in projecting a moody and frightening atmosphere, though what follows it are jump scares. Those jump scares almost dissipates the whole tension building. Luckily, we have Lin Shaye. Elise Rainier has never been more than a caring clairvoyant. And here, we get the chance to see how vulnerable she was and what are her motivations to get back on track in being a ghost (demon) buster. Stephanie Scott did a pretty good job and I hope I'll see her in future movies. Dermot Mulroney and the rest of the cast did well either.

First i'll start of with the positives.\rThis film did actually try to bring some psychological uneasiness to the table with ceratain scenes that out matches most from Insidious 1 and 2. These were subtle and worked brilliantly, like in one scene were the demon shuts out all light in the room slowly, really building the scene up. There were more great scenes like this but for the sake of not spoiling the film i will refrain from typing them. However, i found these scenes brought the films score up dramatically.\rNow the negatives.\rThis film still suffers from the problem pretty much every modern horror film other than recently The Babadook and It Follows suffers from; it's reliance on jump  scares. How many times do we have to tell you jump scares aren't scary, they just make us jump. STOP RELYING WHOLE HORROR FILMS ON THEM. They are fine to be used occasionally. Also, the fact Elise is able to have \"super powers\" of sorts in The Further is a ridiculous addition to the Insidious canon, WHY HAVEN'T WE SEEN ANYONE DO IT BEFORE?!? It looks ridiculous at points to say the least. Also, the introduction of how some characters met seemed so forced, along with the chemistry that becomes of them later in the film. It was cringe worthy to watch. Also, the film suffers from a lack of an interesting colour scheme that the first film even had, only the iconic red door still stands. Additionally i must say, the dad's performance of him being a struggling father was just so overplayed.\rNow finally I must make 2 more points as to why the film ultimately fails. The plot is so bland, boring and uninspired that it is literally kind of annoying to watch. The first 2 Insidious films wrapped themselves round each other quite nicely plot wise but this film is just typical \"girl tries to contact someone. Girl gets haunted. Girl almost gets possessed/ taken. Family call for spiritual help. Family save daughter.\" HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE SEEN THIS? WHY MAKE A PREQUEL THAT DOESN'T EXPAND ON ANYTHING IF THE PLOT IS THE MOST UNINSPIRED STEREOTYPICAL HORROR SCRIPT EVER?!??!?!\rAnd that brings me into my last point, the connection between the films. This film isn't the third film, it is a prequel so I was already a bit annoyed about the title. This film then also has no connection to Insidious 1 OR 2, other than the red demon from the first film popping up at the end. THAT IS HOW YOU CONNECT THE FILM AND SELL IT AS A PREQUEL?!??!? The film shows promise for what they can hopefully do in Chapter 4 but don't count on seeing anything originally scary here.

A younger Elsie Rainier, still a gifted psychic, reluctantly uses her power to contact the dead when a young girl is targets by a supernatural entity.\r Well in Insidious: Chapter 3 we don't have James Wan on the directing chair this time but we do have Leigh Whannell directing this movie and he previous wrote the other Insidious movies and was in the 2004 film Saw playing a character. Now this isn't very new with a first time director who previously wrote movies, did stunt work, acted and people who did the soundtrack to the movie have taken the directors chairs and most of the time it can come off good, but also bad, and in this one it comes off average at best when it comes to film making and the film itself.\r Leigh Whannell who has worked with James Wan in every movie that James did and in this movie I think Leigh cough the tone of the other two movies just about right, I mean this movie isn't has scary as the first movie (In my opinion) because the first movie had that unsettling tone and it's brilliantly use of it's shots which are terrifying and sets up the first movie, yeah it can get a bit ridiculous at times even towards the end but still the first half was some of the most best suspense horror film in recent history. Leigh Whannell did a fine job directing this movie as it's not easy directing for the first time and he did good, at least he caught what made the other movies so horrifying and put he's own twist to it.\r The acting in this movie was alright for the most part.

By 2013 James Wan gave us a pretty good sequel by the name of Insidious: Chapter 2. Now, this year (2015) James Wan decided to produce a third film and pass the director\u2019s chair to actor/director Leigh Whannell (Saw, Insidious Trilogy) who in my opinion did a decent job with this third installment Insidious: Chapter 3.\r The plot and vibe of the film is very similar to the previous ones. Insidious: Chapter 3 is definitely better than most horror movies that are released now a days but still are nothing compared to other James Wan\u2019s horror classics, like the original Insidious, or The Conjuring.  The film involves seventeen-year-old Quinn Benner played by Stefanie Scott (Jem and the Holograms) who shows up to Elise\u2019s (Lin Shaye) house seeking her help in order to contact her dead mother from the paranormal world. Elise tries to help Quinn but midway through her reading finds that things don\u2019t go as planned. This is when Elise discovers that an evil spirit/demon is stalking Quinn.  As the film goes on we see how the demon does everything in his power to make Quinn\u2019s life a living nightmare until he eventually takes her to \u201cThe Further\u201d.\r Now, as for the characters none of them really made a good impression unlike the original. Along with the great original characters, the evil spirit and demons from the originals, made the films creepier and far more intense than this one. Sadly this time around everything fell flat and was ineffective or unsatisfying. The only person that made the movie for me was Lin Shaye (There\u2019s Something About Mary, Insidious 1 & 2) who played Elise. Elise was a sweet surprise for me; she was the bad ass of the film. Some of her scenes made the movie far more enjoyable.  Her role expands far more than it ever did in previous films which I love. Here we learn from where she comes from and what she\u2019s been through.   As for Leigh Whannell as an actor he did a great job embracing the same character that he portrayed in previous films. as for the director, he does a great job, especially exploring different themes within the characters like Quinn, and Elise.\r In conclusion Insidious: Chapter 3 is a decent horror film that has some great moments that allowed great characters like Elise to finally shine on screen. As for the scares, some are visually good scares that contain great imagery while sadly, the rest consist of jump scares that we have been seeing a lot of recently. With all that said it was obvious that director James Wan was not in the director\u2019s chair, which made the film lack suspense and good character development. Because of this, the film ended up being enjoyable to watch but also forgettable.\r Final Score: 5.9/10"}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Diminishing returns on a franchise abandoned to whatever soundtrack scares go bump in the night and a premise wearing thin through each successive iteration. After the transgender hate crime of chapter 2, Insidious returns with a prequel that shifts our attention to another imperiled family. Though the entire film focuses on a convoluted teenage girl prone to occult spirituality as she mourns the passing of her mother and attempts to contact her spirit. Instead of slowly developing the web of relationships and anxieties between this new family we focus on the barely present stereotypical outlines of her perpetually distracted and stressed out working father and the pest younger sibling. Quinn becomes a quasi-maternal center in a family that resents or ignores her coercing her to seek the ideal dead mother who is defined by an interest in vinyl records and the adulation of her daughter (but nothing else). When Quinn calls out to one dead person, one with a more Insidious purpose responds. Sadly the presence of this \"parasite\" or \"demon\" or geriatric ghost in a hospital gown and oxygen mask is far from frightening unless the grim specter of aging is the greatest fear our generation possesses. Watching all three movies makes me question what laws govern \"the further\" (time is not linear as we saw in Chapter 2) there are malevolent spirits, demons and haunted places defined by trauma or violence (but was the red-faced demon in the first movie in the attic of the old house because of the murder that continued to haunt the house in the other realm or was the demon responsible for instigating that uncanny act, just like was the house of the Black Bride near Josh's childhood bedroom because of a connection made when he witnessed the death of the castrated old man?) I realize a supernatural horror film using astral projection as a plot point does not need to conform to logic, but the films are content with telling us a story we already know (like how Chapter 2 combines every gender confused serial killer from Silence of the Lambs to Psycho except with a domineering ghost mother that dresses like a Victorian Vampire and has a vicious right hook). This movie uniquely offers insight into the antagonistic relationship between the murderous Black Bride and psychic Elise and also fabricates a tragic background story about a spouses suicide, it also explains how she teamed up with the technologically savvy ghost hunters who added comic relief to the first Insidious though were less interesting in the second and were ultimately con artists relying on blogs and computer editing to establish a cult reputation as ghost chasers in Chapter 3. So if you are prone to jumping at loud sounds, are afraid of the elderly, find mysterious black footprints that climb the walls unnerving and have spared yourself from seeing the trailer in order to be genuinely startled by the limited soundtrack manipulation of this movie it is well within your rights to see it in the theaters. For those who are more reluctant to part with hard earned money, it will probably be on Netflix in a matter of months."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Certainly scarier and more chilling, than the second one, \"Insidious chapter 3\", will leave you breathless at times and it will remind you, why you fell in love with this franchise, in the first place."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "\"Insidious: Chapter 3\" is a slightly good movie, the good point shows the one case that the character of Lin Shaye had to solve before the Lambert case, and that handling of the prequel was good. The story itself was good and the handling of terror was improving, although the characters did not show some impact than the previous ones."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "This review contains spoilers. It's a solid horror flick - the lead actress plays her role well, Dermot Mulroney is quality, and the older lady psychic is excellent, as usual. What I can say is that the final jump-scare a the VERY end of the movie is terrifying. Reminded of the old \"Quart of Blood Technique\" from 48 hours... You know that some scary is coming when they roll out an extended, benign resolution."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Very dark and interesting story and I liked more than the first two, especially when it comes to the plot and how real life hardships are mixed with a dark story. i would recommend it I liked it."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "This trilogy is awsome ! After wating for decades for a movie that scares you without you need nausea bag while you watch the movie ! But I feel there was  no good screenplay that you admit that !"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "An okay horror-flick. It's an entertaining movie with some scary parts in the first half, some decent writing, good acting and good directing. The second half of this movie went a bit too far for me, but on the other side it also brought a lighthearted element to this paranormal thriller. Because I really think movies like this nowadays take themselves way too seriously. I was a bit disappointed in this movie's villain though; he wasn't fleshed out at all and was just there with no back-story being creepy and villainous.\rBut who cares, this movie was okay. It was a lot of fun, it certainly wasn't the best horror flick out there but I think it also didn't really try to be. This movie succeeded in how scary it was even though the story wasn't something new."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "I'm not a fan of horror movies and horror movies are not my type of movies. In this prequel, we learn that scaring people has became cheesy and clich\u00e9d during 97 minutes of movie time."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This is the SCARIEST FILM IVE EVER SEEN! It's terrifying to the bone and will keep you up with the lights on, and I hope there's going to be a chapter 4! It gives you a reason to love Blumhouse, and is worth time, money, and you might need some extra pair of underwear :)"}], "recommendations": ["ouija_origin_of_evil", "the_conjuring_the_devil_made_me_do_it", "insidious_chapter_2", "sinister_2", "the_conjuring_2", "insidious_the_last_key", "lights_out", "the_conjuring", "the_woman_in_black", "annabelle_comes_home", "it", "scary_stories_to_tell_in_the_dark", "dark_skies", "the_ring", "annabelle_creation", "it_follows", "the_babadook", "happy_death_day_2u", "the_prodigy", "the_haunting_in_connecticut_2_ghosts_of_georgia", "the_possession", "the_black_phone", "scream_2", "final_destination", "annabelle"]}
