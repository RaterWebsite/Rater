      "text": "I enjoyed \"I Can Only Imagine\" last year and now I  enjoyed Breakthrough.\" Sure, the the moral is VERY similar to every true story religious movie, and that's a given when you go into one of these movies, but the casting and story were phenomenal for me. I am a religious person though, so take my opinion with a grain of salt."

Some complaints could be the long ending but the first half of the film is great and gets the emotions going. Perfectly fine film for all ages."

Chrissy Metz's performance as Joyce Smith was stupendous she put so much emotion and power into her performance, her performance was breathtaking. Josh Lucas, Topher Grace, Marcel Ruiz, and Dennis Haysbert also gave fantastic performances. This movie was inspirational, beautiful, heartbreaking, heartwarming, and the most emotional movie I have ever seen. I cried throughout the whole movie. The screenplay and writing were spectacular. Also the soundtrack and the music that was in the movie was beautiful and terrific. Breakthrough gets a A+ from me."

The WORST is when they try and hide it, and you go to what looks to be an interesting story film and find yourself bludgeoned with BS.  This one is over the top with the hoaky baloney. Please, keep your religious crap in your church for the people who are truly looking to be propagandized, fooled, and BS'd"

      "text": "Faith-based film of an unbelievable story of survival, told through a religious lens, whether or not you believe in the power of prayers to raise the dead, we can look at the incident as an inspired story, how the mother (Chrissy) loved her son and believed that he will be recovered regardless of the doctor's opinion, I think sometimes we need to believe in something that has more power than science to save who we love even if it let us down.Solid performance by Chrissy Metz, she was perfect in the mother role. Actually, it's a good movie to watch for believers and maybe unlikable for non-believers, because \"Breakthrough\" focus a little more on the mother's faith and the prayers of the entire community."

      "text": "Breakthrough is a faith-based movie based on the true story of a boy, John Smith (played by Marcel Ruiz) who fell through ice on a frozen lake in a city in the US State of Missouri. Having being underwater for about 15 minutes, not breathing and being without a pulse for up to one hour before being resuscitated, he was effectively given up on by Doctors. Not by his Adoptive Mother, however, who continued to trust God for a Miracle. The movie has outstanding performances by Chrissy Metz (well known for her role on the TV Series \u201cThis is Us\u201d) who played John\u2019s Mother and a good supporting cast including Josh Lucas as John\u2019s Adoptive Father, Topher Grace, Sam Trammell, Dennis Haysbert and Mike Colter. This movie weaves issues of Faith, Adoption and Community into a good story."

      "text": "Prolific actor/director Roxann Dawson (Star Trek: Voyager) shows a good flair for being a first-class actor\u2019s director in this beautifully produced, performed, and photographed production. A strong cast brings what some might call a predictable story to vivid life. Any story based on factual and relatively inexplicable occurrences --based on a strong faith premise \u2013 can\u2019t help but feature a certain degree of predicable asides \u2013 for these are determined by the amazing factual outcomes at its core. There will always be doubters when it comes to incidents that involve supernatural intervention and this will vary with the degree of faith held by the viewer.  Thankfully, this production only features one or two scenes that perhaps begin to fall into the trap of over sentimentalising certain situations. But convincing performances and a generally powerful fact-based script lift it over and above any contrivances.  What comes across perfectly, is the always difficult to achieve embodiment of repaired relationships - especially in this case, involving a damaged adopted family member. Might be worth seeing by all in need of genuinely inspirational entertainment. Others, just stay away or go to a crowd pleasers comic-book action flick if you really want banality.Features Diane Warren\u2019s 2019 Academy Award-nominated song \u201cI\u2019m Standing With You\u201d as performed by Chrissy Metz."

I mean, they clearly haven\u2019t watched the movie and given a fair assessment. But whatever, I\u2019ll keep my review short. The storyline is very good, Chrissy Metz and Topher Grace are fantastic and the cinematography is way better than any \u201cfaith based\u201d film I\u2019ve seen as of late."

      "text": "(Mauro Lanari)Roxann Dawson's debut proposes the return to the fold of Christian theism as panacea against nihilism, and not the Nietzschean one but the one that in Western culture begins with the fatalistic epic of Homer. The resounding success of Kendrick's films guarantees her that she won't need much faith to be sure of the box office takings. And she eludes the age-old problem that thaumaturgy is taboritically ephemeral and sporadically widespread because, evangelically and factually, it is only a \"firstfruit of the Spirit\" (Romans 8:23) for proselytizing purpose."
