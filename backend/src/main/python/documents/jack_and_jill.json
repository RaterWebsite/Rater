Maybe it's because Sandler's humour hasn't changed in decades. I cannot stand his performance as Jack or Jill. And considering they're where 95% of the humour comes from, that's a sign that you messed up. I don't have a problem with one person playing two characters as it shows their diversity and acting skill. However, the characters need to look, sound and be different enough. Adam Sandler however, could not change his character personalities if his acting career depended on it, which it does."

An EXTREMELY unfunny script that made me wonder how film got its $79 million . An extremely unlikeable Jack (played by Adam Sandler) and Jill (who is also played by Adam Sandler) . Racist Hispanic stereotypes (Mexican picnic scene anyone also THAT grandma). Al Pachino also makes an appearance making me wonder how expensive his bills were that the guy who stared in The Godfather (note have not seen that movie) took the role. This means a romance between Jill and Pachino so forced that it would make a gunshot seem weak by comparison. That romance borders on homosexuality since Jill is played by Adam Sandler a dude. This films incredibly lame plot boils down to \"Jill visits Jack, Jack trys to get Al Pachino to star in a Dunkin Donuts commercial\". Speaking of which there is a lot of product placement in this movie (Ex-Sony Computer, The Price is Right scene). So overall this film is not only the worst film of Adams career (which is saying A LOT) but one of the worst movies I have ever seen."

This movie deals with themes of racism, economic depression, and fighting to survive. Every fart joke in the movie leaves the viewer dumbfounded. \"Did they really just. Again?\" is what you'll be saying after every fart joke. Adam Sandler takes on the challenging task of playing a man and a woman. The way he portrays the jill character is one reminiscent of Tony Montana. The inflections in his voice give this powerful Cuban presence, without even being Cuban. Adam Sandler is a modern-day Picasso in the way he paints a picture for his characters. Every role he plays is a new painting, and it's up to the audience to interpret them in their own way. Some people like to call this movie an abomination, abysmal even. But they're just jelly. Adam Sandler is truly a genius. A man who can't do wrong, and a man who guarantees some gut-busting laughs. Anyway, this movie is a stinky pile of ****"

It started for me when I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry came out and through the years with Bedtime Stories, Just Go With It, and Grown Ups, Sandler is getting stale. And now he has resulted in cross-dressing in hope of getting some huge laughs, but the theatre will be full of silence.\r Sandler plays Jack and Jill, identical twins who use to be inseparable yet now Jack dreads having his sister come stay with him once a year during the holidays.

The people giving it 10's are trolls or are simply too feeble-minded to appreciate a comedy that isn't constantly punctuated by farts and kicks to the nuts.  How many times did Jack or Swardson or whoever get hit in the nuts?  3?  4?  I lost count.  And there's almost a twisted genius to essentially making Jill a fart machine.  \"The people want farts?  Boy howdy, they're gonna get farts... Big chimichanga farts that will rattle the whole damn movie!\" Sandler muttered pre-production.There's something far more sinister about Jack & Jill compared to Sandler's other, slightly less terrible comedies of late.  His contempt for the half-wits that lop this stuff up in his audience is laid bare for all to see.  He simply doesn't care.  Remember the South Park where they parodied the trailer?  \"Who cares?  You'll pay to see it, f--- you!\"  They hit the nail on the head.  That's this movie.  It was crushingly depressing to think that the nation was going to embrace this and enable more of its ilk when the creators couldn't be bothered to even give a modicum of effort.  Shame on Sandler and company for squandering their talents.  Yes, I do still believe they're trapped deep down waiting for them all to grow the hell up.And Pacino, what the hell, man?  I mean seriously, OK, yes, you're getting up there in years.  Maybe you wanted to part of a project where they stroke your ego, tell you how great you are and give you the only funny lines.

He pretty much just went on stage and stabbed himself repetitively with this dreck of a film, and I hope that it will significantlydrop as the month progresses. I do have to give Sandler credit, though, for making the awful \"Grown-Ups\" look like a Monty Python production compared to this (never saw \"Just Go With It\"), which is a hell of an accomplishment.The punishment for this film is that everyone involved except Mr. Pacino should be beaten repetitively in the balls with a giant club and then be thrown in an iron bull.

Jack and Jill is hands down the worst film ever made, not only failing on a comedic and technical level, but also on the level of entertainment. Most bad movies garner a few chuckles based on pure goofiness, such as The Room. Jack and Jill couldn't even make me smile once, as I was too busy being appalled at the atrocities I was witnessing onscreen. Adam Sandler has become the representation of cheap, poorly executed Hollywood blockbusters and whatever comedic value he had in the past is gone. His career has been on the decline for years, and this abomination was the long-awaited dagger to his image. It took two Adam Sandlers, both completely unlikable and instantly annoying characters, for people to detect his formula of putting little effort into filmmaking and making large profits off of fart jokes and the occasional adult humor. Even the presence of Al Pacino can't save the movie, and makes it even more depressing when one considers that this powerhouse actor accepted a role in Sandler's cinematic prostitution.\rJack and Jill is a marvel. I can't say I hate any other movie with such unrelenting passion, especially when I realize that ten-years olds are being showed this racist, mysoginistic, and downright unpleasant series of unfinished storyboard sketches. I sincerely hope that these younger audiences don't look to Sandler as a king of comedy, because then the next generation of filmmakers will have a corrupted vision of what true comedy really is. Jack and Jill should serve as the shining example of how to fail in making people laugh: sacrificing the likability of its characters and the intelligence of its plot for inane body humor and inexplicable attempts at social satire. It fails not just because its a broken mess of a movie, but because we all know its creator has the potential for so much better, and his creative vision has been blinded by the allure of box office success. Whether Sandler can turn his career around from this apparent black hole remains to be seen. But for now, Jack and Jill remains as a gigantic blemish not only on his career, but on the entirety of American cinema.\r 0/10\r Follow me on twitter. @cbeers2513"

For some reason, I'm feeling a little downsided for Sandler and 2011 wasn't a great year for him 3 of the 4 films from him were one of the worst Bucky Larson, Zookeeper, and Jack and Jill. He deserves a Razzie award because not only if the critics doesn't care about his movies anymore or just wasn't feeling the energy from the fans and families everywhere, maybe somewhere down the road he could be making a comeback trail.

Married to Katie Holmes Jack is totally repulsed by his twin sister, Jill. As his twin, Mr. Sandler plays her as such a revolting character so as to make her totally unbelievable and there, of course, lies the defect in the entire film. There is no credibiliyt in Jill's character for she is as obnoxious as she is unreal and without reality, humor doesn't work. Relying for the most part on bathroom humor (literally and figuratively) the movie asks us to believe that Al Pacino, who also stars in the film, would ever even sit next to let alone be enamored by Jill. It asks too much so, at a certain point, the viewer just doesn't care. I give this a rating  of  20 and remind its producers and proponents that although the story book \"Jack and Jill\" may have gone up the hill, this movie isn't going anywhere but down. The best word to describe this entire 96 minute theatrical experience is \"disappointing\"."
