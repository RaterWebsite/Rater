      "text": "According to the authors, this movie is for Poles and about Poles.\rTwo brothers are in the center of this controversial move, the older one comes from America to visit his younger one after 20 years of living separately. They discovered that their  village played a role quite different from the official version during years of Holocaust. They found out much more than they wanted to.\r The movie is made as a thriller which I personally do not like. But I understand the intention: the authors wanted a wide audience to see it and discuss it. And they hit the target. Many theaters in Poland banned the movie but it is sold in DVD format in large numbers. Both authors and actors keep receiving death threats for creating the movie. I applaud their bravery."
