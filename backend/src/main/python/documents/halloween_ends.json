The kills are beutiful and the end of Michael himself is amazing"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This is something else. \u2018It\u2019 is something else.Wow. That was unbelievable. Such a ride from beginning to end. \"Halloween Ends\" is not what I expected. It is far better. David Gordon Green has crafted such a beautiful conclusion in a way that doesn\u2019t follow any of the previous movies. There\u2019s a mystery transcending Mystic. He found a way to craft not suspense, but supernatural evil. Evil and violence as diseases or sicknesses to which any of us may be vulnerable. Maybe that's what made this unsettling. I felt vulnerable.\u201cHalloween Night 2019\u201d appears on the screen. Now, this had me doing mental math for about ten minutes before I inevitably gave up the ghost. \"Halloween 2018\" and \"Halloween Kills\" take place on the same night 40 years after John Carpenter's original masterpiece Halloween. Corey Cunningham (Rohan Campbell) is our babysitter the following Halloween. When you see Laurie Strode that is this year, 2022, four years after Michael returned.Welcome \"Halloween Ends\" with an open mind. It\u2019s slow and steady suspense. As the scent of a candle slowly diffuses throughout a room Halloween Ends transforms into the Halloween, we all know and love.The music will have you wondering if you\u2019re in the right theater. I assure you that is indeed the case. The background music is like something from a cartoon. \u201cWhat am I watching?\u201d I thought. I don\u2019t recall any Halloween movie starting this way. The movie opens with Corey babysitting for a married couple. Unimaginable tragedy strikes and the aftermath leaves him traumatized to the present day.Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) narrates her memoir in progress at home with her granddaughter. Unlike the previous two installments, Laurie is living a normal life. My first thought is, \u201cShe is not prepared for Michael.\u201d She has gone from living as a hermit in the woods awaiting Michael\u2019s return to living in a town where she\u2019s ostracized. From the townspeople lies a real sense that Michael is not a force of nature but either a run-of-the-mill serial killer suffering from mental impairment.It is exactly the opposite which makes the shape so disturbing. There is no provocation. And where are these folks getting the idea Michael is impaired and a victim of abuse from Laurie? Absurd.Michael is just evil seemingly transcendent at moments. Four years later, I witnessed Corey struggle with verbal abuse, self-blame, guilt, loss of a promising life & assault. But almost immediately you can tell something isn\u2019t right with him. Something is missing, an emptiness has infiltrated not from the outside but from within. How is that possible? When you watch notice how Corey shifts in demeanor.Allyson (Andi Matichak) has repaired the relationship with Laurie following the death of her mother. Outside of that Allyson is very lonely. Laurie is all she has yet it becomes clear she seeks a romantic partner. LAURIECOREY, PSYCHOPATH OR FREAKSHOWLaurie is Corey\u2019s savior, and dare I say friend when they first cross paths. Only she could empathize with his predicament. Both carry the \u201cbabysitter scar\u201d of Michael in unique ways. It is asked, \u201cwhich one are you freakshow or psychopath?\u201dA game of cat and mouse emerges between the two. In the absence of Michael, Corey fills in as a substitute teacher. He begins to exhibit \u201csymptoms\u201d. Rohan's character grows fascinated by Michael. He is present where the shape would\u2019ve been during Carpenter\u2019s original Halloween. The question becomes not who is Corey but what is he?Notice how he moves from here on out. Let me ask you this: Is the shape Michael Myers as an individual or is it infectious like an idea or sickness?Of course, Michael has to make an appearance otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be Halloween. It is fitting where he\u2019s been chilling all this time. Via a comment made by a homeless man, it\u2019s revealed that Michael has been surviving not in hibernation mode.Michael is aged and rusted in a sense. As he kills there\u2019s a physical revival. Halloween Kills concluded with Laurie stating \u201cThe more he kills. The more he transcends.\u201d Well, what does he transcend into? Gordon explores this and allows Michael to strike Laurie closer to home than ever before.Michael has another enemy this go-round. Someone who seeks to take his power. Three epic battles are progressing and concluding at the same time.Overall, Halloween Ends scares in all the right places. It\u2019s unsettling to the core and edges you forward with intrigue. You won\u2019t feel quite right when exiting the theater. G#d help you if you leave into the night.Funny enough as I left the cinema someone yelled out \u201cIs that Michael??!!\u201d The response was, \u201cNo, that\u2019s Jarred.\u201d"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "That was just a bullsh*t movie, and not how the series should have ended. _"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Not the finale I wanted for me but an enjoyable movie by David Gordon green I enjoyed the movie, yes the pacing isn\u2019t great but I enjoy the different take of this movie with kinda 2 Michael meters that was different I like how different this one was but for me personally I enjoy these 3 films I always wished for better character development but sadly we did not but Laurie was the best in this movie but all around an enjoyable movie, not a great finale tho so I give Halloween ends a B- 80%"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The 4th chapter in the battle of good and evil in the long running saga between strode and myers finally comes its conclusion and ultimate end in this somewhat ok'ish fourthqual.Two movies ultimately mashed together.

Everyone has there own opinions about it some liked it some didn\u2019t"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "****Spoiler Review****For those not liking this movie y'all are missing the point. The parallels between Lauri, Michael, and Corey was it was yrs later and people had moved on no longer enraged or fearing Michael which is what gave him strength (explained in Halloween Kills). From the aftermath the town then focused their ire on Lauri. Both Michael (physically) and Lauri (mentally) were left weakened from the experience. Corey who was weak, was bullied but grew stronger after his encounter with Michael and killing the homeless man and the rest of his victims. Michael grew stronger when Corey brought Officer Mulaney in the sewer to be killed (where Michael lived as a homage to the Return of Michael Myers where he was nursed back to health before killing the homeless man who nursed him). After killing Nurse Deb Michael grew slightly stronger the same way Lauri grew stronger once she realized she had to protect her granddaughter from Corey. Corey's intent was for he or Michael to kill Lauri so Allyson (even though she was gonna leave) wouldn't have anymore ties to Haddonfield. With Michael back the town would've forgotten about Corey as being a psycho. In the end Michael wasn't fueled by enough anger or fear to be the killing machine he truly is but still could've killed Lauri who didn't have enough hope left to fight him. Michaels main scene in this movie was just to finish the job and kill the ultimate Final Girl Lauri which was the culmination of all of these movies. Also I think Corey killed that kid Jeremy I don't think it was an accident like it was portrayed in the movie. A Director's Cut will be great for this movie to piece certain things together. This movie'll be a Cult Classic as more people start to \"get it\". Mark my words."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "(No spoilers) I understand if this isn\u2019t what a lot of fans were looking for, but as a lifelong fan who\u2019s seen, honestly, too many Michael versus Laurie movies now, I really enjoyed being surprised by a different kind of story.

The writing was main problem it just wasn't great; the dialogue was cheesy at time, I really didn't like the decision to have the character Corey try to be the new Michael Myers and do the majority of the killings in the movie he basically replaced Michael in the majority of the movie, I didn't love the way Michael died, I liked the fight between Laurie and Michael's fight, but felt it was somewhat anticlimactic with crushing his body, and I didn't like the small screentime of Lindsey and of Michael and Laurie together but I like that they still were able to come up with interesting kills and that they really killed Michael Myers. The performances of Jamie Lee Curtis, Rohan Campbell, Andi Matichak, and Kyle Richards were superb. The special effects were outstanding.

John Carpenter's Halloween is a model of narrative economy, succeeding largely on expert pacing and atmospheric dread. From the beginning, the focus is on Laurie and the Shape. The latter assumes a prominent role even when he's off-screen as the other characters either talk about him or allude to stand-ins (the oft-cited 'boogeyman').The team behind this sadly hodge-podge affair take the opposite tack. They try to juggle multiple concurrent plotlines, none of which are especially cohesive or interesting. Contrary to the film's marketing, Laurie isn't even the main character; instead, the focal point (insomuch as there is one) is her granddaughter, Allyson and Allyson's misunderstood love interest, Corey. Their supposed romance is not only dimwitted but stultifyingly dull. Moreover, the Shape barely appears and when he does, his behavior is inexplicable set against longstanding canon. This mystifying choice is compounded by ham-fisted attempts to turn him into a literalized metaphor for the dissemination of evil. Let's just say David Gordon Green is no Luis Bunuel.Unfortunately, these attempts to give the film 'layers' it can't support contribute to the film's overarching aimlessness. For a film that bears the weight of capping off a cult favorite series, it's surprisingly meandering. Characters make decisions without any evident rationale or simply against all reason. The result is a chopped-up mess--and not the kind you'd expect given the genre. Don't get me wrong. I'm sympathetic to the notion of doing something unexpected. But that's about all I can admire about this effort. Its formlessness renders any attempts at real scares or tension moot. Only in the climactic 15 minutes or so does the film find its footing, however shaky. The ultimate showdown between Laurie and the Shape is all-too-simple and brief--hardly the cathartic event fans hoped for. The post-violence coda, which has the feel of an 80s-style Afterschool Special, only adds insult to injury."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "apesar de alguns erros e pouco tempo de tela do Michael Myers, eu realmente amei a reconstru\u00e7\u00e3o da narrativa e a progress\u00e3o do novo \"protagonista\".

How does that even work when most of the other films establish he is more of a force of nature than anything else? He always gets back up, that's what makes him dangerous.Eventually the entire town gets together to basically funeral march Michelle down to the local dump to throw his body in a grinder.

Rather, it has Michael merely as a concept and an idea that we as the audience, must project the idea that evil is not the Boogeyman, but a transferrable virus caused by our nurture. Michael contradicts this idea and is evil by nature. Therefore, the film treats him as a disposable entity, contradicting the themes in Halloween 2018 and Ends. This movie tries further to be more subversive and reject Michael but in the end, can't hold enough of its plot to find proper pacing, a consistent message and enough screen time for Michael to have any impact or menace.
