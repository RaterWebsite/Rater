      "text": "This film tells the story of the lives of Colonel Ludlow and his three children (Alfred, Samuel and Tristan) in the prairies. Marked by passions and conflicts, their lives are intertwined with one women for whom the three brothers fall in love (although they don't engage her at the same time, obviously). The film was thought of as a romantic drama of epic proportions and the script, in fact, exaggerates in sentimental appeals in addition to being overly ambitious. The use of big landscape plans, despite being a very attractive cinematography feature and giving the film a more accentuated elegance and beauty, further reinforces this addictive and almost senseless sentimentality, that permeates the entire film, not to mention the soundtrack. The soundtrack is beautiful, but it was used as a permanent romantic leitmotiv and it ends up wearing it and wearing down the public as well. Edward Zwick may now be famous but, when he directed this film, he had no experience with filmmaking, having limited himself to making some mild comedy movies for TV market. This inexperience and willingness to show off in the cinema are probably the origin of such a great film, so epic, so dramatic and so unbearably mushy. I must even mention the quality work developed by Anthony Hopkins (a veteran who shines in the role of the old colonel, as expected) and Brad Pitt, who performs regularly in the role of Tristan, the rebellious son, even if the latter actor cannot survive the wave of sentimentality and have his character transformed into a out-of-time romantic hero, eternally in conflict with the world around him. Either way, it's a watchable movie, especially for couples on Valentine's Day or on similar moments."

      "text": "Beautifully acted and amazing direction, but the movie just seemed a bit...average (albeit on the high end of average). The stars are numerous and at the top of their game and the story is riveting, but Legends of the Fall never establishes the most important part of a movie...a likable character. Where Legends of the Fall fails is the simple act that there is not a single character that the viewer can look at and share sympathy with as each of them are so self righteous or self loathing. Pitt is the only person (along with the minor role of Gordon Tootoosis) that any one can feel for, but even he makes situation so difficult that the viewer can't relate to him or anyone. Legends of the Fall is a good movie but with a likable character it could have been great."

      "text": "Not knowing anything about the movie I could immediately tell it was based on a novel just after a few minutes of watching, and it manages to use that perfectly what otherwise could have been clumsy exposition. This film has everything. It's a great character drama, which is created from a great story and great actors, all on the background of rough, beautiful landscapes. In a few words, this is a film about family, with all the tragedies and heartbreak that come with it."

      "text": "In spite of it's storytelling and writing flaws, Legends of the Fall is a strong character drama, a beautifully shot and romanticized period piece about the West at the turn of the century, and has cemented itself as a modern classic. The performances are the truly strong parts of the movie, particularly Brad Pitt and Aiden Quinn, and Pitt especially shines as a romantic lead. A story of brotherhood, love, loss, and family, Legends of the Fall has a little something for everyone, if you can get past the clunky script and direction."

      "text": "Mixed feelings. I am more disappointed, than satisfied. What's the idea behind this film? That love depends on the circumstances? That all the education in the family does not really matter in the end? It is not clear enough. And that's important for the impact after the film. And there is only confusion here. There is much to be done."

I remember still feeling the moist war clothes on my body after 14 hours of shooting and still hearing the fake bombs go off in my head. It was an amazing experience. But as a movie, it is awful, pretentious, and at times unintentionally hilarious. Also this is James Horner's worst score. But every woman I talk to about it seems to love this movie."

These idiots have lice. \"This phrase was shouted by Colonel Chigington the Indians before the attack, in November 1864. It was a real massacre, many Cheyenne, women, children and elderly, died in agony. I speak of the massacre at Sand Creek. We should not await the advent of Nazism or fascism to hear and see things like that. Unfortunately and too easily forget the man. Just as the mind gives birth to strange ideas sometimes, even the belly of a woman can give birth to these characters mostruosit\u00c3\u00a0.I that caught my attention are: the mother, \"Christina Pickles\", as Isabel Ludlow. First made them, the children and then forget them. Responds to the husband gently on charges of leaving him alone in the education of children with a ... \"Dear William, as always, too much responsibility on you, our children are finding their way, they are stubborn, but, after all, who ... are we to criticize their stubbornness. \" Mrs. Isabel has invented a new type of maternal education, distance learning, made of letters and written advice. The omelette is done! Tristan, it all has understood. \"He refused even to name it\" A son, dear lady Isabel, in seeking their own way can also go astray. I ask - where was she when it happened? \"Anthony Hopkins\" Colonel William Ludlow, after helplessly witnessing the massacre of the Indians, made his life choice, taking on, among other things, by itself, the difficult task of raising three boys by nature not easy . He knows the human soul, \"always deceived in her hopes, and always deceiving ...

What would you change in the election of my child? \"You asked this question Alfred? The Congress is the Government-sir. \"I worked for the Government too. At that time the Indians were concerned, I assure you gentlemen that there is nothing more terrible encounter between a boy and a bullet, entire villages razed, families massacred in their sleep. It 's so that the Government resolved that issue in particular and nothing that has done since has convinced me that has acquired wisdom, common sense or umanit\u00c3\u00a0.Brad Pitt, \"Tristan L. Grande and chameleon in all sequences, is In this film, with its manifestations in nature. Can be as violent as a volcano in eruption and gentle as a zephyr, harbinger of spring. His attitudes are never false or treacherous, and he loves when he does, he gives himself without pretense. I would like to make two small combinations, \"The sages say that when a man and an animal mix their blood become one\" this scene reminded me so much in \"Avatar\" the empathy that has been created between the flier and Jake Sully by way of biochemical. The second refers to a shot from the top of the ship on which Tristan. Here, there appeared to me immediately to mind Gary Sinise, Lt. Dan Tylor - in Forrest Gump.
