      "text": "I had no idea what this movie was about when I saw the posters appear. I eventually got a brief synopsis of the film. I thought it would be raunchy, but amusing. I rented it from my local library. In the world of Sausage Party all food items are alive and can move around, humans just can't see them. THe grocery story items believe that when humans taken them home they go off into paradise. Frank is a good old fashioned hot dog that just wants to be taken home along with a pack of buns featuring his girlfriend Brenda. He wants to put his sausage all up in her bun. After a jar of honey mustard is returned to the store with insight into the real world (food gets eaten) there is an accident that spills Frank, Brenda, and other assorted food out into the store aisles. They try to navigate the store and along the way find out about the great beyond. Oh yeah and **** **** **** ****ity **** There are some interesting sight gags in the film and the animation is well done. Most of the jokes are beyond juvenile and you can see them coming from a mile away. I still enjoyed the first 75% of the movie though. Eventually I wondered how they would resolve the main issue (humans are eating food but the food is alive). They don't really, the movie just sort of goes off of the rails. I guess this is expected due to the absurd nature of the movie.The food also really wants to get funky. There is a giant food orgy at the end. Food characters who are clearly designed to be same sex get it on. Group sex. Just lots of really raunchy stuff. Oh wow you have the two male(ish) Jewish and Arab foods who bickered all movie get down and have sex? Wow what an enlightened movie. The food orgy was funny for about 10 seconds but kept going and going and going. This was the hole point of the movie. Seth Rogan said \"hmm how can I show food ****ing\" and then the rest was built up from there. Blah."

In fact, the trailers are the best part of the movie and spoil most of the funny moments. Cussing in a movie never bothered me and some are actually better with it but this one actually goes over board to the point that it's kind of annoying. It's like the writers couldn't really think of any good jokes so they thought throwing in the F bomb in every piece of dialogue would cut it. And the sex themed jokes come off as a bit weird also. I'm sure I laughed a little at some scenes but nothing really stuck in my mind after viewing besides that totally messed up in a bad way ending. The only positives that I can think of is that the animation and voice acting are good. Other than that, this is a below average movie for me. I would not see it again. I recommend catching it on HBO or whatever premium channel it comes out on or maybe even a rental."

This is one of those films that really rides the shock value of the film really hard with sometimes working to its favor and other times going either too far or shooting itself in the foot with comedy value. To get into this film you must understand that more than likely it will make fun of you in some way but also the fact that those who wrote the script were probably on alot of experimental mind altering drugs. The major problem for this film is that I don't know what to think of it either as a bold and daring move on adult animated films or as a gross cash in on simply trying to find out what is the most shocking thing they can throw up on screen and get away with. Though I will say I would recommend that you watch this film when it comes out on dvd just so you can say you have seen this crazy film because this film is honestly a one and done film. As an added note, the critics taht say this film is written clever or smart as a way to parody religion are incorrect as there isn't anything real clever or subtle about it and hits you over the head with it which is perhaps the biggest detriment to this film's premise."

First and foremost, if you are easily offended in any way, shape, or form, do NOT see this movie! This film goes out of its way to offend as many people as it possibly can. I can\u2019t think of a single group of people who aren\u2019t targets of some kind of joke, stereotype, or just outright racist expression. Be strong of heart, ye who enter here.\r Now for the most part, the movie isn\u2019t that bad. The concept and story are interesting and creative, most certainly something original. The voice acting is actually spot on, not at all distracting and matching every character perfectly. The animation is really good, though, with a strange amount of detail being put into the characters despite the style being cartoonier. Unfortunately, the comedy is really lackluster. There are a few jokes that work (a particularly good one with a certain singer who shares his stage name with food), but most of those are in the trailer and the rest of them are based on the aforementioned racism in this movie.\r For about the first two thirds of the film, if you can get past the incredibly offensive stereotypes, it\u2019s an alright film. But towards the very end, pretty much the second to last scene of the film, it takes an insane sharp left turn into \u201cwhat the f**k\u201d territory. And unfortunately, the scene goes on far longer than it really should. It\u2019s such a bizarre, out there scene that I don\u2019t think anyone in the theater knew how to react to it. I won\u2019t exactly say what it is, but I will say that the sexual innuendos and sexual talk in the film is blown out of the water and firmly secures this movie\u2019s \u201cR\u201d rating.\r This one scene completely flips the movie on its head. What was just an average comedy film was swiftly shoved into the realm of \u201cDO NOT SEE IN THEATERS\u201d in a matter of moments. Wait until this movie comes out on Redbox, and watch it ALONE to decide whether or not it\u2019s something you really want anyone else to see."

Watching this film it felt like someone forgot to tell the writers that the use of the f-bomb in and of itself is not funny. I maybe laughed 4 times during this entire film. I went in expecting something on the lines of Team America. But instead got a bad CollegeHumor student film. The film's attempt at an anti-religion social commentary is about as subtle as a brick through your windshield. Racial stereotypes and characterizations abound without any of the true craft of self exploration through humor.\r South Park, Family Guy, and the Ted films do this kind of thing so much better.\r This movie is garbage.

      "text": "On paper this must have seemed like a sure fire hit. A crude and politically incorrect toon about food stuffs misguidedly dreaming of a better life outside of the super market shelves. Unfortunately, the execution leaves a lot to be desired and the bad taste jokes remain just that with the lack of laughs exacerbating the true offensive nature of the material, which possibly has something to offend almost everyone. There is a certain irony to be had from the fact that the film, aimed squarely at the adult market, is more juvenile in concept and writing than \u2018Finding\u2019 Dory\u2019 or \u2018Zootopia\u2019, both of which are intelligently written, imaginative and truly funny. For most of its running time \u2018Sausage Party\u2019 flounders without inspiration in a desperately hysterical manner. A couple of gags raise a grudging smile and there is one very good sequence where the different sausages and veg discover their fates in a suburban kitchen. Other attempts at humour, however, involving a lesbian taco, a Stephen Hawking inspired bubble gum and a Middle Eastern pitta bread all fail miserably. Where the film does succeed though is in underlining the low level of humour to which the whole enterprise aspires."

The racist stereotypes could be funny, if the joke with them as less about, \"Look it's funny because we're being super racist in an animated movie\" I've seen and love South Park. South Park does something with the fact they use stereotypes without the joke literally just being, \"laugh because it is a stereotype.\"\r The movie is relying too much on the concept that it is an R rated animated movie to push beyond that.

The humour is largely based on less than subtle dick jokes that one would hear in high school emanating from the class clown. I really find it amusing that grown adult film makers wrote and produced this \"comedy\" movie.\r Overall, I would not recommend buying a ticket at full price at the theater to watch this \"comedy\", just wait till it is on Redbox and rent it for a day or two. Trust me, there is really nothing to see here."

Afer some philisophical discussions, a ragtag group of edibles then try to save themselves from certain doom. Kind of a funny movie actually, but it weakens towards the end. It gets way too crazy, and not in a good way. The ending was weak, capping off a mildly enjoyable film with a disgusting taste in your mouth. It leaves you asking, \"What were they thinking?\" However, if really raunchy humor is your thing you just might enoy this."
