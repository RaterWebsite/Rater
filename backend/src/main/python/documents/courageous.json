  "description": "Law enforcement officers Adam Mitchell, Nathan Hayes, and their partners stand up to the worst the streets have to offer with confidence and focus. Yet at the end of the day, they face a challenge that none of them are truly prepared to tackle: fatherhood. They know that God desires to turn the hearts of fathers to their children, but their children are beginning to drift further and further away from them. When tragedy hits home, these men are left wrestling with their hopes, their fears, their faith, and their fathering. Can a newfound urgency help these dads draw closer to God... and to their children?",

But ya know, those people are missing the point this movie is trying to make. It's not suppose to be about the acting (although I thought they did a pretty darn good job). It's suppose to be about the message. God is the perfect father & although no human is perfect because God made us the way we are, it is still our responsibility to follow him & do as he asks. Try our best to be the best we can be. God gave his only son to die for OUR sins! That's amazing! Could you do that? You dont have to! Because Jesus took that for you! That is something none of us could ever completely fathom. You may call it \"Jesus freak\" or whatever your term for it may be, but I call it following my father who loves me unconditionally. And I plan to show my children that same devotion & to continue to follow my Lord & Savior. Thank you Lord for all the blessings you bestow on me & for sending your only son to die for MY sin. I can never fully repay you but I will spend my life trying nonetheless. I love you Lord. Amen."

Just because God and Jesus are referenced doesn't nullify the truth of what fatherhood should be.  If your dad believed in Jesus and also fulfilled his God-given role as a father for you, why would that be offensive?  Anyone who can't see the truth revealed due to their easily offended heart will hate this movie.  I'm not one of those and I loved every moment.  Bring extra Kleenex for your neighbor and prepare to see what being a father is supposed to look like."

Our theater was busy so we chose this movie..... and glad we did.  If this doesn't make you think, like a few of the critics did not, then you are already a lost cause.\r It is rare to hear applauding at then end of a movie, but there was that and cheering.\r This movie is more a call to arms for parents to start being parents again, like 25 years ago.  Not let the government raise out kids, but us.  And I think our society would be a better place if this was a required show for all high school teachers and students.\r Yes, it talks about religion as its base for responsibility, but that facet can be replaced by anything.  It is about  the need to raise our kids and ourselves responsibly. With any foundation you think is necessary.  This makes you reevaluate your life to day, and the going forward.\r This is about taking control of ourselves, raising our kids responsibly, and being there.  Pure and simple."

There is one thing everyone has to agree on, christian or not, and that is that the bible, true or not, has good messages and that it teaches a lot of things that would make life better! No, you don't have to get on your knees after you see this movie and repent, but i do hope that anyone who sees this movie goes home and becomes a better dad! I will openly admit to being a christian, and because of that i love this movie that much more. I still hope that the movie has a family impact on you, however.

Yes, the acting is good but not great, but you should see this movie for the message and the content and not because of the acting.  This movie leaves you knowing that there is more to life than just working, doing the honey-do list, and \"being a dad\".  As they stated in the movie, \"anyone can have a baby, but it take courage to be a father\".  This movie is excellent, and I highly recommend it to all the husbands, fathers, and teen boys out there!"

      "text": "Courageous, like many of the Kendrick brothers' previous works, is truly only for the converted (myself included in that group, that doesn't mean that I have to like any Christian film that rears its head). I can't help but to say that this movie did impress me, though. The filmmaking is quite impressive, considering its humble origins. The Kendrick brothers have proved that they have come a long way from Flywheel and proudly show off their more developed sound and production values (this is their first film to surpass the million-dollar-budget mark), but that doesn't compensate for most of the rest of the film. While it is an improvement in subtlety and nuance in comparison to Facing the Giants and Fireproof, that does not make it subtle; it is anything, but. The first twenty-so minutes are not bad, but once Adam and his cop pals start discussing religion, it gets weird. The film verges on being, unintentionally and with good intentions, overtly racist. They meant well, but they need a more observing eye in the editing room saying: \"Do you think we should have made every single bad-guy black, and the poor characters Mexican?\". I believe that this question of unintentional racism could just be over-scrutiny from me, but look over the film again and you might find many plays into stereotypes. Granted, this film succeeds at the actual filming and action a bit more so than I thought it would, I actually enjoyed some of the action when I took it out of the context of the film, but the action may serve two purposes: a metaphor for courage in the home and a ploy to pull in audiences. Once again, this is probably over-analyzing from me, but make note of it. Overall, the message is very powerful, but needs better delivery. Is there any other way to bring out a character's reaction to their daughters' death than through weeping only, I ask? Crying is just fine, but wasn't quite the reaction of depth I had hoped for. All-in-all, if you are a film critic, you will while despise Courageous, a Christian, you will praise it, and if both, you may feel conflicted. This film does need to be seen by the converted to keep the faith, but without any reach to the others, it may defeat the purpose of the message it could have conveyed so well, but I knew it wouldn't be able to."

If you have ever been stuck in a church pew when the preacher could not land the plane, you know the kind of pain I am speaking of.

      "text": "As a frequenter of movies I continue to ask myself one question \"What should I be feeling?\"  Many movies can deliver a great and enjoyable story, but what's lacking is the amount of emotion that the viewer feels.  Courageous is able to bring that feeling of joy, sadness, and relief to the viewer in spades.  Never have I been to a film that's made me want to cheer for the good guys and want to beat the crap out of the corrupt ones.  If there's one thing this movie does perfectly, it's evoke emotion.  Even in scenes that I had no reason try tear up for, I still did, the emotion is just that powerful.  As far as performances go, they're mostly solid, besides a few hiccupy lines I felt as if all the characters were believable enough and allowed for a more immersive experience.  The only problem I found with the film was the story, I felt as if some of the fathers didn't get enough screen time, I don't want to spoil anything for you, but some get waaay less time than the main dad.  This hurts the experience in a way that made it less of a 'band of brothers' ordeal in which they try to become better fathers, and more of a 'I'm a cop who has family troubles and am going to steal screen time from my other cop friends so that they can only tell their awesome stories in montages'.  But as far as the narrative goes it is one that is heavily Christian and heavy on fathering a child.  The introduction scene makes this very apparent, with a thrilling sequence that ties the viewer in and keeps them going for the whole film.  But the movie won't spend all of its time beating you over the head with emotion, suprisingly, there are some very funny moments, one in particular that takes place in a cop car.  This allows the viewer time to break up the tense and emotional atmosphere and adds more life to all the characters, allowing for more immersion, which is always a good thing.  Overall the movie feels very segregated into one section, will non Christians enjoy it?  I'm not sure, it depends on your religious preference, do I think this is one of the best father son movies of the year? Without a doubt.  If you're looking for a great film that will tug at your heart strings and evoke emotions you didn't know you had, you've found it, as far as Film of the Year goes, this is one my heavy hitters."

Why? because that's easy and people pay to see it. Courageous sets the bar much higher and still comes close to clearing it. That said, there are some major things about this movie I can't help take issue with. I appreciate that they are trying to restore the family and address the problems in society, but they're focus is in the wrong direction. They are blaming the wrong people.

Remember--so called \"pro\" acting is rehearsed over and over and the script is written for them and the special effects, cameras,  etc--there is NOTHING real about most hollywood movies--least of all the acting.  I think this acting represented what real people are really like more accurately than most hollywood movies do.\rSecond--God's message and mission is far too important to leave to the missionaries alone. We must all live it and share it with others-- even Hollywood must do its share--especially to those who scoff and mock. Don't let yourself be deceived, God is not mocked. For whatever a man plants that is what he will harvest. Plant scoffing and mockery of God and you will receive scoffing and mockery from God. Get it?"
