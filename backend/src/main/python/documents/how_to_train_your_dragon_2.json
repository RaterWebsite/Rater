Thanks to his studies and constant analysis of dragons, people of Berk now a lot more about dragons and understand them better. They are living peacefully with tamed dragons until a group of dragon hunters arrive from a neighboring place. From then the story gets twisted and we unpredicted events unfold.\r Hiccup constantly pushes to solve the problems with conversation and dialog unlike most vikings in his town who are ready to fight and use violence. He relentlessly engages with the \u201cenemies\u201d and keeps a discourse with them. He constantly studies them and tries to understand them.\r There are two strong themes in the movie that made me love it. The first theme is the relation between humans and animals which symbolically represents the relation between any two group of adversaries: two races, two ethnicities, followers of two religions, or even two nations. Through the movie, when a group studies and understands the other group, animosities subside, mutual respect flourishes, and the common cores of both groups bind them together. In the call for understanding other groups, this movie implicitly asks us to throw away all the preconceptions and dogma and look at them, judge them, and treat them fairly and justly.\r The second strong theme in the movie is Hiccup's constant search for his identity. He is confused about who he really is and why he is different from all other vikings. But he also ceaselessly searches and seek what he wants to do with his life. He is fearless when he faces challenges and new experiences.\r How to train your dragon 2, is a phenomenal movie, the kind that you have wait years for to come and the kind that will fill you with joy whenever you remember. It is extremely fun to watch with an amazing story and unbelievable cinematography. It is a kids movie for adults. After watching this movie, all you want to do is flying and pondering on the questions that it touches."

      "text": "This is a very good film, but for me it lost the charm of the original. Typically, sequels to an animated movie end up being trash, but this film doesn't follow that trend. As a sequel, it has more dragons that are very interesting and cool looking. The action, graphics and overall story in the film are great as well! I'm very happy with the progress of the main characters, and it really sets up the 3rd film well. Where I was turned off, was the constant need to force Toothless into doing cute actions. In the first film, Toothless had a genuine cuteness to him, but in the sequel it was overdone and quite frankly became distracting. For example, there would be some important dialogue between characters, and then Toothless would be doing something in the background... I guess they put this is for the kiddies who could care less about what's going on in the story, but as an adult, I care about the characters and the challenges they're trying to overcome... but I couldn't focus on what they were saying with how distracting Toothless became during those scenes. Also, I really liked the rag-tag bunch of Hiccups friends in the first film. They were a ton of fun, but in the sequel, they didn't have the same impact. Astrid as Hiccups girlfriend is boring, and Snotlout, Fishlegs, Tuffnut were not really funny. Ruffnut was definitely the best of the group, but her \"joke\" quickly ran its course, when they used it over and over again. Other than the many distractions from Toothless and the lack of fun from Hiccup's group of friends, this movie was a fantastic sequel. I will recommend it to all families and feel like it's a great challenger to Lego Movie for best animated film of the year."

      "text": "For starters, \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon 2\u201d has a very mature and rich story that is filled with emotional and dramatic depth. It grows our characters from the first film and really feels like a continuation of the series and not just some cash grab. We see how Berk has changed and how the lives of everyone on the island has become better, I really love how the film tackles darker subject matter like remorse, forgiveness, and redemption, while at the same time touching on themes of love and loss. The screenplay is filled with moments of pure heart and we really see the bond between Hiccup and Toothless expanded upon. Not only is this a great screenplay, but also Dreamworks\u2019 best since the original \u201cShrek.\u201d\r The characters and voice actors are perfect. I love how the characters have grown and their personalities have been enhanced. Hiccup takes a more proactive role in this film and we really see that he\u2019s matured a lot from the first film. His and Toothless\u2019 relationship is expanded on and it really is still the core emotional center of the film. The side characters like Astrid and Snotlout get more screen time this time around and they actually do more with the film. They aid with the comic relief to keep the movie a little lighter than the extremely dark tone that it\u2019s going for. There are a few new characters introduced into the universe like Valka, Eret, and Drago Bludvist. Valka is a great character and she\u2019s another great female addition to the roster. She has a great emotional ark and not only that, she is a strong character and a better dragon master than Hiccup that really holds her own. Eret is a nice addition to the cast as he is also comic relief, but also a interest side villain character. Drago is a fantastic villain and is really a cold hearted murderer. His method of mastering dragons really differs from Hiccups and its a great contrast that shows the different types of people that are in this world. I love how they build him up before actually revealing him.\r The animation and visuals are probably amongst the best I\u2019ve seen from any CGI film to date. It is just breathtakingly gorgeous. The character\u2019s movements are so fluid and each character has their own way of moving. What I found really impressive is the facial animation. There are so many intimate moments in this film that require no dialogue and we can sense exactly what the characters are thinking from their expressions. There is always something happening in the foreground as well as the background and it\u2019s unlike anything that I\u2019ve seen before in the medium. Characters could be taking in front of the camera, but in the background there could be an epic battle taking place. There is a lot to take in, but the director, Dean DeBlois, knows how to balance the visuals with well paced story. The layout and environment are also quite impressive. Every blade of grass, powder of snow, and water particles are just amazing to look at.\r The score from John Powell impresses again and really enhances the already great score of the series. It\u2019s bombastic, epic, touching, and moving. There is something about the score that really makes the film so much better than it already is. I was literally left in tears because of the score and how beautiful it is.\r I\u2019m gonna come out and say it. \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon 2\u201d is a MASTERPIECE amongst modern films and a revolution in animation. It is a film that is going to push animation further and allow the medium to be taken more seriously. For a major studio production, it goes to places that the medium has only thought of, but couldn\u2019t really pull it off because of limitations set by studios and audiences alike. It is almost a near perfect film and I award it the highest 5/5 that I can."

The plot and dialogue are pretty mundane, the characters lack any spark or originality, but the animation is lovely. There's too much dialogue for young audiences, but enough action sprinkled throughout to entertain. Overall, an uninspired and unspecial followup. (I don't understand why several of the Vikings in this village have Scottish accents.)"

      "text": "Story:\rFive years after the Viking village of Berk has made peace with the dragons, dragons now live amongst the villagers as working animals and companions. But when someone wants to control all the dragons, it's up to Hiccup and the gang to stop him. The film has been getting a TON of praise from critics, so much that I decided to finally begin reviewing animated films (Will eventually go to other genres). Whereas the 1st film's story revolved around Hiccup as he tries to earn the respect of his father and fellow villagers, along with developing a relationship with Toothless, the 2nd film focuses on Hiccup's family and the dangers that Drago Bludvist has on the dragons. To me, I don't see what the critics are talking about when it comes to the story being refreshing and original since it does have some problems. The story here is by-the-books: (To avoid as much spoilers as possible, I won't reveal anything important) Hiccup learns about Drago, Drago does evil things, Hiccup meets Drago and tries to solve the problem without violence, Drago does more evil things, Hiccup has to stop Drago in the end leading into a final action scene. The story here is nothing new and amazing as critics seem to say, and since this is one of those animated films that centers around its story and characters (as in their contributions to the plot) while also having a serious tone, having a cliched story actually hurts the film more than it would in something like Madagascar or Rio. In fact, the story in the 1st film to me felt better than here mostly because of Hiccup's great chemistry with some of the characters. Overall, the story is receiving more praise than it deserves. 6/10\r Animation:\rThis is the film's biggest strength as the animation here is spectacular. The backgrounds look stunning, the textures are great, the character designs are well made, the environments vary from snowy mountains, to lush flora, to ice-y terrain, and Berk. Another impressive thing was the variety of dragons. There were at least 30 different kinds of dragons seen, and each one looks like they have their own unique feature that makes them special. You can easily make an encyclopedia on all the dragons here. But the most incredible thing about the animation were the action scenes, especially with some \"Alpha\" dragons fighting in the background. Definitely watch this movie in 3D or IMAX if you can. 10/10\r Characters and Comedy:\rAs said, to me the 1st film made better use of the characters than here. I'll say that Hiccup's relationship with his father Stoick and his mother Valka make for some of the more heartwarming moments in the film. Dreamworks did add in some emotional scenes here as things happen to Hiccup, and it's great to see him change throughout the film because of those actions. His bond with Toothless also serves as another highlight to the film. His scenes with his family and Toothless are some of the best moments in the film. As for all the returning characters, they don't serve much of a purpose in the film outside of mere comic relief. I'm even disappointed that Dreamworks didn't expand Astrid and Hiccup's relationship seeing as how they're a couple now. Astrid just follows what all the side characters do now. As for the villain, Drago is your standard-dark dressing, eye-slashed, gritty-voiced villain who doesn't have an interesting backstory or goal. He wants to control all the dragons. So original. As for comedy, the returning side characters are mostly comic relief, so with them and Toothless, you'll find some nice comedy sprinkled here and there amidst all the action and conflicts. It's clear that Dreamworks focused more on Hiccup, his family, and Toothless more than their returning characters and villain. 7/10\r Sound:\rJohn Powell does an incredible job with this score incorporating a more \"epic\" fantasy feel to the film. The score ends up immersing you into this fictional world that Dreamworks created. They even added a song to the mix. It features Hiccup's mom and dad singing a song they hold dear to them, and it's a nice addition to an already incredible score. Oh, and the sound effects here are fine, especially in the action scenes. 10/10\r Acting and Casting:\rAll the performances here are great but if there's one thing I have to complain about, it would be Jay Baruchel's voice for Hiccup. Watch the movie and find out why. I also feel they didn't use Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse to their full potential. But the acting is still great and the casting is fine. 8/10\r Verdict:\rThis film although great, is sort of overrated when it comes to praise. This is mostly because of the flaws in the story and some of the characters. But the animation and score are what makes this film soar over Frozen and The Lego Movie. This is my pick for best animated feature of the year.....for now.\r Extra:\r+1 for being a sequel I enjoyed.\r Rating: 9/10"

This looks like a live action movie\". but aside from the incredible animation, deep down this movie's something even more. it takes the characters we all loved in the first one to the next level, just like a good sequel should do. ya know in the first movie, Hiccup was the boy, the boy who found a dragon. in HTTYD 2, he has to become the man, the chief of Berk. this reminded of \"The Lion King\" or \"The Empire Strikes Back\". i walked outta the movie like \"This is probably \"The Lion King\" or \"The Empire Strikes Back\" of this generation\". the action's exciting, the comedy's hilarious and it has fantastic emotions. i actually cried like 3 times in \"How To Train Your Dragon 2\". this movie's not just for kids, it's also for adults. i mean, adults are gonna love this movie, cause there are themes that really hit them, and kids are gonna love the movie cause it's a fun and exciting action/fantasy movie with incredible animation and awesome dragons. and when they grow up, they'll start to understand the darker themes and emotional aspects the movie was going for, and they'll appreciate it even more. that's what i call a good sequel! another one of the great highlights in the movie, it's the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless. to Hiccup, Toothless's a lot more than just a pet dragon. he's Hiccup's best friend and they really show how complex the emotional bond between a person and an animal can really be. it was perfect in that sense. the only small gripe i got with the movie, it's that Drago could've been a little better as the villain. don't get me wrong, he's still a great new character and the movie does make him better as it goes. it's just that, when he first showed up, i was like \"This guy feels kinda weak\". that's just a small gripe, it's not enough to bring the movie down. honestly, i can't think of anything bad in \"How To Train Your Dragon 2\". it's the best animated sequel from DreamWorks we have, since \"Kung Fu Panda 2\". Dean DeBlois, i really hope you win the Oscar for this movie. you definitely deserve it! you gave us one of the best sequels in a really long time. i'm telling ya, Dean DeBlois knows what he's doing in every movie he makes. he gave us \"How To Train Your Dragon 1\" which was amazing. now, he gives us \"How To Train Your Dragon 2\" which is even better. i'm really excited for \"How To Train Your Dragon 3\", but i don't know how they're gonna top this one. this is the BEST animated movie of the year, and probably one of the best animated movies in a really long time. so, if you haven't seen it yet, go watch it. i swear to you, you're gonna love it.\r 10/10"

      "text": "How To Train Your Dragon 2 is a sequel that actually lives up to it's predecessor. It was what I was hoping for and more. The movies starts out with a Dragon competition with all the dragon riders. Astrid, Snotlout, Ruffnut, Tuffnut, and Fishlegs. At first you have no idea where Hiccup is. Once the competition is over we are now soaring through the sky with Toothless and Hiccup. Greeted with one of the best songs in the film. People talk about this movie not having heart, but it's just as big maybe even bigger than the first film. It will make you laugh and maybe even cry.  It had it's joyful moments and some sad moments too, but throughout it always was perfectly balanced. It was darker than than the first movie, but that's okay. I love that it tread on the dark side sometimes. Life has it's darker moments and that made this movie feel so real, even with dragons flying around. Toothless always brought a smile to your face, even during his vicious times. Without a cute dragon like Toothless the film might be too dark for younger kids, but since he is there he helps keep the film balanced perfectly. I say go see it as soon as you can if you even remotely like animated films. Bring your kids if you have any because they certainly won't be bored, and I don't think you will be either."

Incr\u00edvel como conseguem divergir totalmente do livro, e mesmo assim criar uma excelente hist\u00f3ria. O segundo filme ficou melhor ainda que o primeiro, mais maduro, com uma trama menos \"infantil\", e com uma batalha \u00e9pica que fez a batalha dos 5 ex\u00e9rcitos do Hobbit passar vergonha!! Manteve um n\u00edvel de excel\u00eancia para a franquia, e com certeza veremos um \"How to Train Your Dragon 3\". Que a DreamWorks mantenha o n\u00edvel dessa franquia!!"

      "text": "How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a mixed bag for me, on the one hand, its disjointed, annoying and preachy, but on the other its gorgeous, thought provoking and deep. It has many amazing shots and touching pieces of dialog, but it has just as many polar opposite moments. If I had to sum up my thoughts on this movie in one word, it would be disjointed. There are many amazing scenes in this movie, when Hiccups father is reunited with his wife it is truly touching and extremely emotional. But the surprisingly plentiful scenes of the girl twin swooning over arin son arit son of arene son of Arathorn, is strait up stupid, its totally disconnected from the tone of the rest of the movie and was clearly thrown in there because every family movie needs to have comic relief characters. Ugh, actually the friends in general, aside from Astrid, are painfully stupid to watch. They don\u2019t add to the story and they do not need to exist, why are they even such main characters in this movie? You could have had just Hiccup, Astrid, Stoic, and hiccups mom be the main characters, it\u2019s really baffling. And while you\u2019re at it, add Gobber to the list. He is probably the worst offender aside from the twin girl. When he interrupts the scene where Stoic and Hiccups mom are singing to each other just pulls me out of the scene every time. He completely breaks up the scene and it feels completely separate from what we are experiencing. In the first movie he was the kids mentor and he taught them and the audience about dragons, but here\u2026 he\u2019s just pointless! Except for creating laughs for the kiddies to giggle at, and that\u2019s not a character. I don\u2019t care about Gobber when him and Stoic are going after Hiccup, I care about STOIC! Gobber is one dimensional and not funny\u2026 to me anyways. *sighs* and all of these points can be put towards the twin girl and the rest of the friends as well. Its funny they actually have a resolution for the two guys trying to impress the twin girl, like what the heck? Why should I care about that? Short answer, I don\u2019t. Its jarring compared to what\u2019s actually happening and it just pulls me out of the movie and leaves me wishing they were just eradicated from the whole movie. And if they did that, then it woulda been like 20 minutes shorter!\rBut other than that, I really do like this movie. While I do have more negative reactions inside when I here this movies name, I do like quite a lot in this movie. Like the animation, its stunning. Anything to do with water, ice, or hair looks photo realistic. Its insane. The character models have gotten a MUCH needed upgrade. Hiccup ACTUALLY looks like a freaking human! But I do think that because they used motion capture, the people do seem a little jerky\u2026 particularly in the first act. But its not really a problem, just an observation.\rThe relationship between Stoic and the mom is really heart wrenching. I do feel like these two are in love I believe their story, and it really is heart breaking when Stoic dies, while I don\u2019t think Hiccups reaction is handled very well at all, I do feel for him and when they send him to\u2026 val hallah? Right? Right. The relationship between Hiccup and Toothless is really the anchor for the whole thing. You really get the idea that these two have been best friends for a while and they have gotten really good at working together. However I do have a problem with toothless, and the portrayal of dragons in general.\rI think they went a little over board with the intelligence of dragons and they make them borderline human. In the first movie, Toothless was intelligent, he had coherent thoughts and a distinct personality. But he was still an animal, it never felt like he was just as smart as his human companion. In Dragon 2, he is borderline human. And it is really disjointed from the first movie. Now, the designs of the new dragons are far, FAR better than the first one. They look truly awesome. One\rlast thing about the dragons, is anyone else perplexed at why night furies would evolve to have their back spikes be split in two, without them knowing? Like toothless almost lost hiccup twice because he couldn\u2019t fly alone, but he had this hidden feature that his species hid from themselves? What\u2019s the evolutionary advantage? Why would toothless not know about this super useful ability that is a part of his physiology? It makes zero sense, but that\u2019s really just a nitpick and doesn\u2019t affect the overall story.\rOverall, How to Train Your Dragon is a mixture of downright amazing, and painfully silly. It\u2019s deep and emotional, and stupid and silly. I have quite a few problems with it, but all in all it is a great time.\rHtTYD2 gets a 6/10, stunningly beautiful, yet painfully silly."

These Dragons and people are even funnier. Even when some other girl falls in love with a villain. Another Masterpiece by Fox and DreamWorks.! Great Job who ever director! Be sure to look out for an Special Trailer for the new DreamWorks Movie: Penguins of Madagascar! Coming Soon in 3D!"

Dreamworks usually takes the backseat and strides behind Pixar but with How to Train Your Dragon 2 they might have a winning formula to overcome the hurdles. What is really great about HWTYD2 are the script and characters. The script is moving and digs deep about life, death and overcoming all odds. The cinematography, score and graphics are gorgeous and helps evoke the emotions of the film."

The dragons are cute, though, but I feel this is one of the animated movies that drags the genre down instead of lifting it up."

      "text": "\"How to Train Your Dragon 2\" has just become one of my favorite movies of all time.  This film takes everything that was great from \"How to Train Your Dragon,\" and improves upon it immensely.  Seriously, this movie is amazing!  The visuals are amazing, the sound is amazing, the score is amazing, and the characters are amazing!\rEverything about this movie is outstanding.  It's hilariously funny, gut-wrenchingly sad, and extraordinarily uplifting at different points throughout the movie.\rI'd also recommend that you see it in IMAX 3D, as the visuals are definitely made for this format.  Without a doubt, this was hands down, THE best IMAX 3D movie we've seen all summer, and we've seen every movie that's played in IMAX 3D thus far.\rSeriously, if there's one movie that you see this summer, this should definitely be it."

      "text": "Pretty steep step down from the original which I thoroughly loved.  It's significantly darker than its predecessor and less funny.  The characters, story, dialogue, and writing have all gotten worse.  I took my daughter, who really liked Astrid in the original.  Though a girl, she was driven in a way no other character was and outperformed all the boys with her determination.  In the second book, she's abandoned all that ambition and spends most of the movie doting on Hiccup.  She identifies now seemingly as nothing more than his future wife and has hardly any lines.  That was disappointing.  They did introduce another major female character, but she was nowhere near the inspiration that Astrid had been.  Similarly, the lessons from the first movie, to see past our prejudices, are nowhere to be found.  The story is muddled, and the jokes don't work nearly as well.  I'm sure kids will like the action, but adults will be mostly bored.  I certainly was."

Beautiful, emotional and dazzling, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is the best animated film in years and puts some animated sequels to shame."

It's a shame because the first film was such a surprise. Alas, there in lies the key. The first film was quite fresh. This sequel may not necessarily be re-hashing events, but the spark of originality has gone. Aside from the afore mentioned pluses only the score adds any further distinction."
