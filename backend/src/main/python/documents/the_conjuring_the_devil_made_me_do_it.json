It's a slow burner leading to a quite mediocre ending. You dont feel that attached to the characters the Warren's In this story. because the story is all over the place. The story revolves around arne a young man who under demonic possession kill his friend and is on trial for murder that could lead to the death penalty. The Warren's have to figure out how to save arne by proving he was possessed when committing the murder. The demon is really a background character. And really serves nothing more then a plot point to the real evil person in this movie. The story simply follows a evil satanic worshiper named Isla who studies the black witch craft and a follower of the cult of the ram.that gives her powers through a curse that binds herself to a demon. The witch needs 3 special sacrifices to the demon, and its not really explained why she needs to perform these sacrifices, just that she does it for her diety. If she doesn't perform the proper sacrifices the demon takes her soul back to hell.The movie is 1hr 52min long when the movie should have been at most 90 min."

      "text": "It\u2019s an absolute dud when stacked against the previous two entries in the conjuring series. The plot is meandering and doesn\u2019t know how to share screen time with its disparate characters, the scares are intensely generic and mediocre, and the overall tone leans to heavily into wholesomeness. It feels incongruent with the subject matter. There\u2019s this strange feeling that the entire world only involves the Warren\u2019s and that priest that seems to tag along in every scene. The film is almost too self-aware, and appears to be imitating a diluted gist of the previous movies. Stakes never feel very high, and the convoluted plot approaches nonsense far too often to be taken seriously. And the main villain? Who the hell is this woman? Why do I care at all about her curses?Everything about Conjuring 3 is weak and dull, and the acting is either melodramatic or silly more often than not. The best I can say is that it is competently made, and some moments were interesting conceptually. With that being said, this movie is generic horror fare, and will impress absolutely no one."

It still revolves around real-life husband/wife paranormal investigators (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga), who encounter yet another demonic possession that they must investigate and overcome. Even though there are a few jump scares, this is pretty much a by-the-numbers haunting with creepy dark rooms and ominous sound design to telegraph every fright. The actors manage to convey tension, but it\u2019s still just a lot of bumps in the nite. This linefrom my review of the original still holds true: \u201cMaybe I\u2019m jaded or too experienced with the genre, but I was never scared or surprised.\u201d"

For both the filmmakers and the viewers.Many times there's talk of wanting a change, but deep down, they really don't want it.They want the same scares, they just hope to be caught off guard.The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do shows a strong change by losing James Wan as a director, since the atmosphere of the films he made is still there, but not the tone, and the most positive points of the film lie more in the work of the main duo, that in what the story and the new director end up doing.Some things I liked, I admit, but there are many others that just seemed quite predictable to me.This is more than anything because, although this film changes the style a bit, the narrative continues to be supported by the same tropes, and that's tiresome and boring, because believe me, waiting for something to come out of the dark is no longer effective.Problematically the film explores a different type of villain, but it never decides to go for it all, and is resolved in a sentimental ending.And that was a shame, because if this franchise is looking for a fourth film beyond its financial success, it really needs a formula change, from start to finish, especially since the spin-offs have also weakened the franchise in terms of ideas.It's mentioned that this installment is less terrifying than the previous two, but the other two did not seem terrifying either, so the scares depend on you."

I get he\u2019s booked with Aqua-Man sequels but man he needed to come in and give some advice on how to make a film legitimately scary or at least unsettling to your viewers. This needed major rewrites bad, Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are above this material, but I don\u2019t blame them because they got their paychecks at the end of the day no matter how this does.Also, its biggest crime is going in. a whole new direction than what we\u2019re used to. When your villain can suddenly pop out of thin air and teleport everywhere you\u2019ve lost me, there\u2019s a problem when the only thing that sticks to me is hearing and seeing the Annabelle doll chilling in the background. Even her recent sequel knew how to have some fun.Overall, it had interesting ideas, but it needed better direction and it makes sense since it was helmed by the same dude who make the curse of La Llorona a movie while had its moments was mediocre at best. I hope moving forward they learn from their mistakes and attempt to get back to what made this series work to begin with."

      "text": "I really like The Conjuring 1 and 2. Both are some of my favorite horror films and that is mostly because of Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, and Director James Wan. While the film still has the two actors, James Wan isn\u2019t Directing this one and it\u2019s noticeable. It feels like a rip off of James Wan style which sucks because he made the first 2 movies so interesting while this one falls into the worst trap a horror movie can fall into; being boring. While the opening feels like something James Wan would do and it\u2019s the best part of the movie, the rest of the film fails miserably to match that energy. While 1 and 2 had some issues, the uniqueness of it and the scares always kept you engaged but in this one, Ed and Lorraine are the ONLY interesting things about this movie. The story falls into a stereotypical horror film with every story beat being predictable and while yes the first 2 films were predictable, it was getting to that end that made you invested but this time you know everything that is going to happen. The first two films benefited from having supernatural elements while this one is just a witch lady who isn\u2019t dead. I really don\u2019t understand why they did this. She isn\u2019t possessed by anything. She just kinda walks around and manipulates people. There were some things I liked about the film though. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga still do a good job with the material and John Noble was pretty great as well. Some of the cinematography looks nice and there is a great shot at the beginning that takes inspiration from The Exorcist. That\u2019s about it. There really wasn\u2019t a whole lot I liked. It was just a very bland, very forgettable, and unscary addition to this flailing universe. If you have seen the first two then you might like this but skip this and just watch the first 2 Conjuring movies."

I went in to this movie with low expectations knowing James wan wasn\u2019t directing, and they were using the guy from the \u201ccurse of whatever\u201d, which was probably the worst horror filM I\u2019ve ever seen."

      "text": "There's something strange in your movie theater. Who ya gonna call? Ed and Lorraine! That's right, Streamers, your favorite paranormal couple is back. The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It was finally released in theaters and HBO Max this weekend. This time the Warrens battle the forces of evil that made a man kill. His defense.... I bet you guessed it... the devil made him do it. But, let's see if the devil is in the details of this flick.Now, if you're familiar with The Conjuring series (including the Annabelle series), then you won't need much introduction for this flick. For those who are just traveling to the theater for a horror flick or out of pure boredom of this pandemic, you really don't need to know anything about them. That's a bonus for this third sequel. Yes, they make reference to Annabelle and their previous work but it's completely insignificant. Overall, this is a self-contained story and a classy one. Part of this film and the others is that The Conjuring have found a genuine way to be creepy without being gross, gory or even over the top. This movie gives you the chilling feeling like the others without even a curse word. While it's great to be classy and all, in a third movie you'd think the scares would go to the next level, but here, they actually took a step back. That's no bueno especially after the second movie had one of the most disturbing faces with the Nun. This flick didn't have that or anything memorably scary. It has scares but unfortunately they are ones we've seen before. The only positive is that the scares are unpredictable, which to some could be a good thing or a bad thing. In a way, I like that I couldn't cover my eyes at the moment I knew it was coming - some may not be so satisfied. The filmmakers of The Devil Made Me Do It were able to make this film in a way that isn't like a typical exorcist flick, which frankly was enjoyable but they could have done more. I appreciate that they made an off shoot of The Conjuring flicks which feel like not just another run-of-the-mill possession film just for the money.Also, the cast is fine as usual. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson give us their typical Lorraine and Ed. Nothing wrong there. The issue becomes their storyline is a bit distracting to the overall movie. In other movies, their love story was used to lighten the mood between the intensity of the rest of the film, but here it felt a bit more like filler and puffing. We still get our reprieves, but again something just feels off. All of this leads to the feeling that this movie isn't that scary, which is unfortunate because the movie is held to a high standard based on the first two movies.Nevertheless and neverthemore, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is certainly a welcome addition to The Conjuring series. Unfortunately, I find this to be the least scary of the three, but that may just be a bonus for those of you who don't like horror movies. The Devil Made Me Do It is a solid horror movie that provides the creeps without the over the top gore or in your face grotesque nature. Enjoy a matinee movie time or check this out on HBO Max with a bowl of popcorn."

It was interesting that the gene of control of that boyfriend of that girl girl was in his possession with demonic things, and one of them was the scene that showed how much the two couples Ed and Lorin loved each other and how much they feel in love with each other.  It was one of the best scenes in this movie in my opinion, but the rest of the story was also interesting. Mysterious with a bit of fear, and I liked that whatever the movie was, it was more beautiful than Anabel, more beautiful, it was much scarier, it was much better in my opinion."

Everything seemed off.  The acting/casting, the cinematography, the writing, score/music, lighting, visual effects, editing, you name it.  It had neither jump scares nor creepy \"hair on the back of your neck stands up\" scares.  Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga did the best they could and I can only hope they get a proper final outing in the future.  The film was an absolute chore to sit through.  My movie making experience is incredibly limited.  However, after The Curse of La Llorona and this, I think I'll pass on anything else Michael Chaves puts out.  Not only do I believe he has little understanding as to how to use the camera, sound, and lighting to build tension, but he also included two shots where extras glanced right into the lens of the camera.  The first time, I let it slide thinking my eyes played a trick on me.  The second time was near the end.  The prosecuting attorney was looking at Arne, then clearly glanced at the camera, then back at Arne.  I rewound it, paused and sure enough... she glanced right into the camera, lens, realized \"oh crap, I'm looking at the camera\" then looked back at Arne.  The fact that Michael Chavez didn't catch during editing this means he's either lazy, hoping no one would catch it or he's incompetent."

      "text": "The Conjuring has established itself as the most successful franchise in the horror genre. It was subtitled \u201cThe devil made me do it\u201d. The first two films were highly praised by specialized critics, with an incredible 86 percent approval and the second with 80 percent.The film features the story of Arne Cheyenne Johnson, the first defendant in the history of the United States who claimed to be possessed by a demon in 1981.In the first 11 minutes of the film, the exorcism of a boy of just 11 years old, David, Debbie's brother, is shown, and it is at this point that Arne invites the devil to possess him. In the first scenes we have many references to classic movies like the exorcist.Directed by Michael Chaves, the same director of The curse of La Llorona, The Conjuring 3 has many different aspects from the previous ones, mainly in terms of direction. James Wan was really missed in the film because it brought aspects that no other director can bring to horror movies in general. The film does not present what was promised, it lacked great memorable moments and hardly anyone will be afraid watching it, in the previous ones we have Nun Valak, Annabelle and even the crooked man different from these, the main villain of the story is not remarkable and will hardly win a movie for not be as interesting as the other characters.The plot features Ruairi O\u2019 connor as Arne, Sarah Catherine Hook as Debbie and Julian Hilliard with David who fulfill their roles well as the main supporting characters. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga return as Ed and Lorraine doing a great job again.Warren's flashbacks are well explored here, bringing out how they met, which becomes an important memory in the development of the film.the conjuring 3 is far from being the scariest of the franchise, it only shows part of the criminal investigation and even Arne's story at times is left only in the background, the ''scare'' attempts didn't work. It ends up becoming good for those who are already a fan but nothing interesting for those who are not a fan of the franchise. The first movie remains the best of the entire The conjuring universe, becoming a horror classic today.maybe the ending is a little exciting"

Thank you Warner Bros. and Co. for this added complication. Honestly, the deeper we get into this franchise, the less scary these movies get for me. What \"The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It\" lacks in genuine terror, however, it makes up for in experimenting with how far a movie can stretch the \"based on a true story\" label. That may sound like a slight, but it is genuinely the most entertaining part of watching this film unfold. That, the core mystery at hand and the two lead performances from Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are enough to get the job done. For me, most horror movies fail with subpar acting and a boring narrative in hand. \"The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It\" might not be the strongest of the franchise in any regard, but it is -- at the very least -- well-acted and entertaining. So, for my money, it succeeds, albeit marginally."

If you don't like Christianity and Western Civilization, please avoid movies about demons and vampires. You're bound to see some crosses and hear some prayers!

      "text": "The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It (Invoca\u00e7\u00e3o do Mal 3: A Ordem do Dem\u00f4nio) Lembrando, n\u00e3o sou Cr\u00edtico de cinema, a minha opini\u00e3o pode ser diferente da Sua, bom vamos l\u00e1. O filme come\u00e7a com uma cena ic\u00f4nica, Sem d\u00favidas a melhor abertura da franquia, Julian Hiliard manda muito bem, a atua\u00e7\u00e3o desse moleque \u00e9 incr\u00edvel. Bom depois disso, o filme muda de atmosfera, ele abre n\u00e3o do terror que conhecemos nos dois anteriores. Ele simplesmente mergulha na hist\u00f3ria, o filme tem jumpscare? Tem, l\u00f3gico at\u00e9 pq estamos falando de um filme da franquia Invoca\u00e7\u00e3o do Mal, n\u00e3o \u00e9 mesmo? KkkkkkMas os jumpscare S\u00e3o muito poucos comparado com os filmes anteriores. Invoca\u00e7\u00e3o do Mal 3 a partir da cena de Abertura vira praticamente um Suspense investigativo e ao contr\u00e1rio dos filmes anteriores o alvo n\u00e3o \u00e9 focado totalmente na fam\u00edlia, os Warren S\u00e3o um dos alvos principais eles correm muito perigo aqui, embora eu ache o menos assustador entre os 3, o filme me deixou com o cora\u00e7\u00e3o acelerado (e n\u00e3o me pergunte pq) eu simplesmente estava aflito, isso foi muito bom pois como o filme n\u00e3o tem muitos jumpscare, foi a hist\u00f3ria que me fez ficar assim. O filme tem alguns al\u00edvios c\u00f4micos envolvendo uma cita\u00e7\u00e3o a Annabelle, Cita\u00e7\u00e3o ao Elvis Presley etc... KkkkkkkkDiferente de A Freira e Annabelle 3 esses al\u00edvios c\u00f4micos ficaram muito bons e se encaixaram muito bem na hist\u00f3ria.Vamos falar dos cen\u00e1rios? Eu Simplesmente fiquei apaixonado pela fotografia do filme (principalmente a cena envolvendo o necrot\u00e9rio) foi dms. Sobre o vil\u00e3o? \u00c9 o menos ic\u00f4nico da franquia, mas isso pode ser explicado pelo fato de n\u00e3o ser uma entidade sobrenatural e sim algo f\u00edsico. Esse terceiro cap\u00edtulo \u00e9 bem diferente dos dois anteriores como eu disse, ele tr\u00e1s outra ess\u00eancia a franquia, o que \u00e9 bom, nos leva a lugares jamais explorados pelos Warren antes. O lance envolvendo bruxaria combinou com a hist\u00f3ria. Vamos falar da dire\u00e7\u00e3o? Michel chaves evoluiu muito desde a Maldi\u00e7\u00e3o da Chorona, aqui ele prova se o filme tiver uma hist\u00f3ria boa ele consegue sim mostrar pot\u00eancia. Se por um acaso voc\u00ea n\u00e3o gostar desse filme, tenho certeza que n\u00e3o vai ser por conta da dire\u00e7\u00e3o. Vamos falar das atua\u00e7\u00f5es? Julian Hiliard como j\u00e1 havia citado \u00e9 muito boa cara, virei f\u00e3 do trabalho dele (embora ele apare\u00e7a pouco no filme)  Ruairi Entrega uma atua\u00e7\u00e3o perfeita como Arne.  O resto do elenco est\u00e1 muito bom, todos cumpre bem com seus pap\u00e9is dentro do filme. Mas \u00e9 claro os maiores destaque S\u00e3o Vera farmiga e Patrick Wilson como Lorraine e Ed Warren, s\u00e9rio eles s\u00e3o sensacionais naquilo que fazem, principalmente a Vera, que mulher maravilhosa a express\u00e3o no rosto dela te passa toda a verdade do filme. Conclus\u00e3o: Se voc\u00ea gosta de um terror com hist\u00f3ria, que mergulhe realmente naquilo que est\u00e1 contando, se voc\u00ea gosta de filmes que se preocupam em te contar a hist\u00f3ria nos m\u00edseros detalhe, Invoca\u00e7\u00e3o do Mal 3 \u00e9 o filme feito pra voc\u00ea, voc\u00ea ir\u00e1 amar. Agora, se por outro lado, voc\u00ea \u00e9 aquele tipo de pessoa que gosta de levar sustos, pular da cadeira toda hora, talvez voc\u00ea n\u00e3o goste tanto desse terceiro cap\u00edtulo, pois como eu disse ele \u00e9 mais um suspense investigativo. Minha opini\u00e3o: ele n\u00e3o supera os dois anteriores, pra mim o 1 e o 2 me fisgaram Melhor (principalmente o 2) mas esse terceiro n\u00e3o fica muito atr\u00e1s, ele realmente da outro visual aos filmes de Invoca\u00e7\u00e3o do Mal. Ent\u00e3o assista ele com mente aberta, de que ele n\u00e3o vai ser o film\u00e3o aterrorizante e sim um filme que vai te contar uma hist\u00f3ria de terror com um pouco de sustos ao longo. Minha nota para Invoca\u00e7\u00e3o do Mal 3 \u00e9: 9.0"

      "text": "The long-awaited third Conjuring movie moves away from the haunted house style horror of its predecessors in favor of a murder-mystery angle that naturally sports a strong supernatural element. The results are nothing short of a letdown. Not because of the new approach or anything, but rather the noticeable lack of James Wan at the helm. Director Michael Chavez proves to be a poor substitute for the longtime genre veteran, as despite having a compelling narrative to work with he is unable to bring any real terror to the table making the whole experience far more boring than it should have been.The actual story itself certainly covers some frightening material. Regardless of whether or not you believe in the demonic entities they worship, the existence of satanic cultists isn't something that can't be denied and their inclusion here does add an extra spine-chilling quality to the proceedings. The problem is that this tension never manifests itself onscreen. The attempts at scares are all of the generic exorcism variety and it gets so caught up in its own plotting that it almost forgets to include any for the entire middle portion of the film.While it lacks the thrills and chills we've come to expect from the series, it does at least still have the Warrens and in one of their more interesting cases to boot. Which counts for more than you might think. It's nice to see that more sentimental nature of The Conjuring 2 was not lost in this follow-up. Once again the bond between the paranormal investigating husband-and-wife duo is a core focus and wonderfully brought to life by the incredibly charming Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga who make these protagonists the most endearing opponents of unholy evil this side of the Insidious franchise. There's a emotional component added to the mix because of this that, along with the sight of child's body contorting under the influence of possession, actually got me a little teary-eyed in a few parts. Although ultimately ending up kind of dull to watch unfold, the concept alone is also fascinating enough to likely keep you engaged until the credits roll. It definitely inspired a desire in me to learn about the real event this is based on. If only to decide for myself whether or not I buy Arne Cheyenne's claims.If you're a fan of the previous two entries and the larger universe that's been built around them this may still be worth checking out for you. However, it's an unfulfilling continuation to some of the greatest works of modern horror that most devastatingly does little to raise the pulse or cause any feelings of unease in the absence of their original director. Chavez did do a respectable job and shows potential, but Wan's shoes were simply too big for him to step into. Leading to a very promising premise feeling like it went to waste in what is so far the biggest disappointment of 2021.5.5/10"
