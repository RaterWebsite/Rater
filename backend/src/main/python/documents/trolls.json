      "text": "In truth, this film fulfilled every single expectation I had going in. It\u2019s a bright, upbeat and musical adventure that will easily keep kids entertained and smiling for its entire duration. On the one hand, the happy and colourful vibes are a lot of fun, but given the film\u2019s painfully formulaic story, occasionally excessive cheeriness and obnoxious musical numbers, Trolls is often more annoying than the pleasant family affair that it could be.However, let\u2019s start on the bright side, with the incredibly bright colours. If there\u2019s any reason that kids (we\u2019re looking at 8 years and under) are going to like this, it\u2019s because it\u2019s full of colours and joy wherever you look. A perfect merchandising picture, Trolls does the job of being the kaleidoscopic family distraction it needs to, but also goes a little further by usually being happy from the heart, which did bring a smile to my face from time to time.Another positive from this film is the voice cast. It\u2019s an A-list ensemble, and the likes of Anna Kendrick, Justin Timberlake, Zooey Deschanel and Christopher Mintz-Plasse all put in energetic and entertaining performances. The screenplay doesn\u2019t give them much to work with, but in fulfilling the primary objective of being upbeat and enjoyable, you can\u2019t fault the cast here.Despite that, the ultra-happiness of this film is something that\u2019s likely to wear thin for anyone over 8 years old, and unfortunately turn into a more annoying watch than anything. Of course, this film is great for its target audience, but I would definitely warn any parents or anyone else thinking of watching this that it\u2019s going to get boring very quickly, and then get even more irritating.A large part of that is down to the story. The quest to rescue x and y is probably the most overplayed plot formula in kids\u2019 movies. Now, some films have proved that to be a great watch (Finding Nemo for example), but usually by offering a little more depth than simply watching the characters walk through various landscapes and then sing a song at the end.Here, however, there\u2019s very little beneath the surface. Again, it\u2019s bright and colourful, and that\u2019s all young kids need for an enjoyable watch, but the story\u2019s lack of depth and originality becomes painfully apparent very early on, and sets you up for a good hour of totally predictable and uninteresting adventure clich\u00e9s.All of that\u2019s pretty bad, but if there\u2019s one thing that I really hated about this film, then it\u2019s the music. Heavily advertised as a musical before release, you\u2019d be forgiven for expecting some entertaining melodies here, but that\u2019s not the case. We know how good singers Anna Kendrick, Justin Timberlake and Zooey Deschanel are, but this film just pushes the music way too much.Constantly getting in the way of the plot\u2019s development, the music seems to only be there to get the runtime over 70 minutes, failing to give you the same love for singing as the trolls do. The specific songs are generally classic pop hits, but jukebox musicals only work if the music fits in the film, and it just didn\u2019t come together here, with a weird variety of songs (including The Sound Of Silence by Simon & Garfunkel for some reason) that is yet again for annoying and distracting than entertaining.Overall, whilst it\u2019s definitely an enjoyable watch for young children, given its bright colours, simple plot and upbeat vibes, Trolls is unfortunately a pretty intolerable watch for anyone else. Its shallow and formulaic story is boring, its happy atmosphere gets on your nerves pretty quickly, and the music is intrusive and annoying at every moment."

It has the same sort of idea of, do the kids 3D animated kids film formula and stick it out there that Norm of the North had.  This one felt like some effort had been put into it, whereas Norm of the North feels like it was just made to make a buck!  Does that make it a good film, hell NO!!  If it wasn\u2019t for Norm of the North, Trolls would be the worst animated film I have seen this year.  I really didn\u2019t like this film and came out of the cinema extremely annoyed.  The plot is all over the place, the characters were annoying and obnoxious, the voice acting was terrible, the writing is god awful, to such an extent, I didn\u2019t even mention that the world has absolutely no concrete plan, since the writers couldn\u2019t be bothered to think that up and the film has absolutely no climax whatsoever, it literally just ends, it couldn\u2019t be bothered.  The humour is never funny, and it\u2019s just a lot of constant noise and movement, except for one sad moment(if you can even call it that), which was a welcome bit of relief after spending 1hr 30mins watching a film that was constantly on.  I hated this film and I really never want to see it again.  This is just a glorified advert for a terrible Soundtrack and if you want a terrible kid bops version of songs that were mostly awful in the first place, with a couple of exceptions, then you are welcome to it, but frankly, I am out, this film was painful."

      "text": "Feel The Joy, Feel AliveVideo games, documentaries, true stories, songs, theatrical productions, mechanical attractions or books are some of the sources of inspiration for the seventh art to develop a universe full of ideas. Children's films certainly opt for puerile subjects correlated with today; the toy industry its main ally. Rich in genre and style, adaptations have been varied about small and innocuous objects which entertain the kids: \"Ouija\" by Mike Flanagan, \"Lego Movie\" by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, Michael Bay's \"Transformers\" and clearly \"Toy Story\" by John Lasseter are vast references in the prominent sub-genre. As a demonstration of its infallible success at the box office and acceptance by movie critics, they are mostly franchises willing to continue expanding. It's patent that the plurality of this type of films totally controls child audience, and the latest invention in the subject also does it.From the studio that brought you \"Shrek\", \"Madagascar\" and \"Kung Fu Panda\", comes out a colorful range of characters ( they hope it becomes in a profitable franchise ); with a conception very similar to \"The Smurfs\", \"Trolls\" or \u00abDam Dolls\u00bb (original name) is the most recent work of animation factory, Dreamworks. The Danish fisherman and woodcutter Thomas Dam created in 1959 a doll of excellent quality, featuring sheep wool hair and glass eyes. An error in the copyright made its reputation was biggest due to the manufacture of illegal imitations of minor detail, was so great the commercial impact obtained, that they even harbored superstitions related to the good luck that the consumer will acquire. Nowadays, the popularity of toys is insubstantial, however, its filmic project comes loaded with tons of marketing, ranging from dolls to music discs.What If I told you that you can have the opportunity to experience true and complete happiness, eating a positive small being? \"Trolls\" is about this. These tiny and adorable creatures to live, to hug, to dance, and to sing every day, every hour. Like the Smurfs, these friends share singularities Park and emotional certain designating your color and way of being. Unfortunately, his perennial satisfaction is affected by the despite and hideous Bergens, desirous of a dose of love and joy. Years of abstinence have passed since last joy festival, and now the Chef (Christine Baranski) has located the whereabouts of small enthusiasts. She abducts a good part of them, obliging Poppy (Anna Kendrick) and her pole apart Branch (Justin Timberlake) - something like Joy and Sadness from  \"Inside Out\" -  to rescue their family. An adventure of discoveries, deceptions and union will do the journey a passage full of color, music and teachings.In movies like these is frequent to see great singers, models, actors or characters lend their unmistakable voices in order to give more brilliance and personality to the film. Kendrick, Timberlake, Deschanel, Stefani or Corden are the main team, identifiable by their mere surnames. Seeing the artistic convergence of its leads, \"Trolls\" is the perfect musical for a contingent wave of children's films of such tone, which are to come. Classics of yesteryear and modern classics are put together in each scene in a wonderful way, usually accompanied by an original dance routine and flashing graphics. Earth, Wind and Fire's \"September,\" Lionel Richie's \"Hello,\" rhythmical \"Can't Stop the Feeling\" by Timberlake or the duet on \"Get Back Up Again\" will make you provide a chorus, slightly move your feet or scream wildly with trolls on screen. Obviously, it is not \"Frozen\", but offers a different direction to musical animated movies.Thanks to the development of the story, it is noticeable that screenwriters and artists have been inspired by the big successes of Pixar. The most striking is the template selected from \"Monsters Inc\" and \"Inside Out\" for characters and situations. It conceives memorable characters with difficulty, the same thing naturally attained the Pixar film with all its monsters; \"Trolls\" does the attempt, nonetheless, categorizes its characters in recurring roles, Bridget as Cinderella, Cooper as Rex from \"Toy Story\", Poppy as Joy from \"Inside Out\", and the most obvious: Cloud Guy, comical-periodic role almost copied of all feature films in Pixar.Although it is occasionally cloying, too childish and sickeningly sweet, it enchants with each frame. Visually, the art department, visual effects and animation capture the sensibility of the moment, with thousands of textures such as felt, foamy, glitter, or hundreds of vivid colors with different tonalities, and nuances; the situations get their greater brightness in front of the spectators.For those who manage to touch the ground, sitting in a movie theater seat, \"Trolls\" can be too noisy, colorful or sickly-sweet. For those who have to go the bathroom with dad, \"Trolls\" is an explosion of teachings - joy isn't in the tangible, is within yourself -, music and toys that you will want to buy out of the theater. Being one or the other, \"Trolls\" is a proper continuation of modern musical films, with a powerful soundtrack, irresistible visuals, a concise story and a rebirth for the marketing of the film."

Creo que si.\r La animacion es algo que caracteriza mucho la pelicula, ya que se puede apreciar la gran calidad de colores vivos, parece que estoy viendo stop motion y editado a computadora, no se, como que los trolls parecian mu\u00f1ecos o algodones de azucar xD.\r La comedia es algo que no tengo mucho que decir de ella, ya que no encontre chiste alguno en la pelicula que me diera risa. pero si, tienen un buen sentido del humor.\r El soundtrack o la musica, es excelente ya que estas tienen emocion, i cant stop the feeling, el tema principal de la pelicula, y true colors, son canciones que en mi opinion, son las mas memorables de la pelicula. sin embargo, es mas disfrutable oirlas en ingles, no porque en espa\u00f1ol este mal traducido o que las voces sean flojas, es que en espa\u00f1ol cambian algunas palabras para que quepe en el momento justo. Pero bueno, esto es como un musical, estoy mas acostumbrado al espa\u00f1ol, gracias a dios que no todas las canciones fueron traducidas. Yo digo que las canciones estan muy bien.\r Los personajes son muy carismaticos, cada uno con su personalidad, me senti muy identificado con casi todos los personajes, en especial Ramon/Brench y Bridget, cada uno con sus problemas y emociones. La relacion que tienen los personajes cada uno, tienen momentos divertidos y entretenidos, y otros son motivadores.\r el final me parecio un poco forzado, ya que todos quieren comerce a los trolls, pero luego de 4 minutos derrotan a Cocinero y a creek simplemente lanzandolos en un carrito e incendiandolos. para luego los bergen y los trolls sean felices para siempre. Bueno admito fue un buen final conclusivo, pero fue muy rapido.\r En conclusion, trolls es una de las mejores peliculas animadas del 2016. Tiene todo lo que busco, tramas poco complicadas, momentos de sentimiento y entretenidos, colores realmente vivos y animacion unica, y un soundtrack pegadiso y alegre. Una pelicula que la verdad te entretendra con tu familia.\r Calificacion: 9/10: Excelente."

Warning though parents this is a movie that is full of peril and dangerous situations for our heroes the trolls .you may need to keep reminding sensitive kids that the trolls will be able to make it threw the tough situations. It looks hopeless for our heroes sometimes exspesualy when about to be eaten by giants keep this in mind please parents when taking them to the movie and remember that it's pg for a reason and it shouldn't be ignored when making the choice of taking small kids or sensitive kids just sit back and enjoy the ride"

It's rambunctious and often zany sense of humor and plot brimming with optimism are enough to keep the movie going for both kids and adults alike even in the face of some fairly standard writing. I think they kind of messed up the message a bit. Their efforts to teach us that happiness is in all of us is a good choice for a time where depression runs rampant. The goof up occurs when the movie unintentionally(?) tells us that while happiness lives inside all of us, we need to be in a relationship in order to find it. Not exactly the best idea to tell kids true happiness comes from others so they better get to dating.Things move at a mostly solid, but the fun dips off a bit when we are left to follow the \"Bergen\" characters around. I really didn't care for the Cinderella styled romance shoehorned in to extend the running time. Luckily that's only a small part of an otherwise enjoyable movie. The trolls are likable and even the musical numbers aren't bad. I would have preferred more original tunes and less covers, but whatever. I'm more than willing to look the other way thanks to the excellent use of The Sound of Silence. Much better than the Disturbed cover. Oh, and of course it's funny.While it doesn't stand among the best of what DreamWorks has to offer, it still proves to be an enjoyable family movie. Much better than one would expect from a movie based on those ugly dolls that were so popular back in the 70's and 80's. The animation is better than that of even a Pixar feature and the laughs and charm carry viewers through it's less than desirable moments.7.5/10"

At least I enjoyed it, despite being an adult, particularly a male and a bachelor. It looks more a little kids' film than for anyone else. Because the film was based on the famous dolls. Usually film comes first and then follows its dolls to the markets. But this film has a reverse concept and a very much acceptable. Yes, it was not great as Disney's or Pixar's animations, but the DreamWorks animation is always there behind these two, considered the third best and according to that limit, you should expect the film.It's a musical like most of the animations are and one of the tracks made into the 2017 Oscars for best film songs list, but the film did not make into best the animated feature. Directed by the director of one of the sequels of 'Shrek' series. Technically, it sounds awesome with cute character models, colours, songs, music and particularly the voice-overs. The story wise, it's not bad, except the concept of eating trolls makes the real young kids go fright.Good for families and even better if you choose to watch it in digital 3D format. The runtime was good with a fine pace. In the line of smurfs, gnomes, fairies, and now these trolls to add in the list for children to watch growing up. Don't bother watching it if you are an adult and only like and enjoy adult films, other than seeing it neutral, as well as opinioning. Purely an entertaining film and I strongly suggest it for the little ones.7/10"

Not to mention that you'll feel like dancing in your seat through nearly every one of the songs, especially Can't Stop the Feeling. However, while it's visually one of the best Dreamworks films, the film isn't exactly perfect. For starters, the supporting cast don't offer much (heck, Gwen Stefani only has one line in the entire movie), and the humor is hit or miss.

It\u2019s another antic pop-culture whirligig, with some of the fast-moving prankishness of \u201cThe Lego Movie,\u201d but it has a touching theme that dips into a major issue \u2014 namely, what\u2019s the nature of happiness? \u201cTrolls\u201d is the right film to pose that question, because it\u2019s an ecstatically happy movie, a giddy EDM kiddie musical that sends you out on a high.A storybook prologue done in felt colorforms tells us that Trolls are \u201cthe happiest creatures the world had ever known.\u201d That makes sense if you think back to your own childhood connection to the iconic Troll Dolls, created in 1959 (as the Good Luck Trolls) by the Danish toymaker Thomas Dam. They had androgynous cherub baby faces with big marble eyes and grins so wide it creased their cheeks, bellies that bulged with just a bit of prominent navel, and, of course, those electroshock billows of cotton-candy hair that seemed to shoot right out of their soft plastic heads. The hair, which came in different wild colors, was their most defining feature, yet what really made the Troll Doll special is that it seemed to be beaming, with an innocent mysterioso knowingness. It\u2019s no accident that the dolls got big in the early \u201960s: Away from their outfits, they looked like naked angels reborn as baby hippies. That made them, to a kid back then, the coolest toy in the universe.\u201cTrolls\u201d was produced in cooperation with the Dam Family, but the movie makes no fetish of Troll Doll nostalgia. It\u2019s very much a present-tense Troll movie, and though it\u2019s always light and fun, there\u2019s nothing quaint about its motivating conflict: The Trolls live like blissed-out Hobbits in the middle of a woods, but they also live in fear of their sworn enemy \u2014 the Bergens, a tribe of giant dyspeptic ogres who are miserably unhappy but don\u2019t want to be, and the way they\u2019ve devised to become happy is: to eat Trolls. They do it ritualistically, once a year, on the day they call Trollstice."

In fact, that's probably why their brightly colored mops seem to be exploding out of the top of their heads. I mean, how do you keep that kind of neon joy combed down?These cute little guys are so blissfully gleeful that they can't keep themselves from breaking out in song at any given moment. They love to hug, too. They hug each other so much that they have to limit it to once an hour just so they can actually get something else done.However, always being that euphorically enthused does have its drawbacks. For one thing, it emphasizes to those less-happy sorts that they're kinda missing out.Take the goblin-like Bergens, for example."

Teaches children about the importance of caring, being good to each other and that everyone deserves to be happy. Great for the whole family, found myself on more than one occasion jamming out to the songs, as well as my daughter."

I like the animation style, the felt look on the characters where really fitting!4. the sound track was really fitting to the emotion the characters are in, and how in the song \"true colours\" the song went from happy to sad!the things I dislike are:1. characters come and go WAY to much, I only know Poppy, Branch, The Chef and the prince as a result2. the colours where bright to the point of me thinking I'm on DeviantArt looking at a mary sue3. I WANTED A KISS FOR THE END NOT A HUG!! (this one doesn't count)well, do you agree, I hope you like my opinion!"

Or how Creek betrays his friends. Over all it has a sweet plot and the characters are fabulous! It deserves a spot among some of the greats. P.S Mr Dinkles is adorable!"

The lighting and materials are enchanting and the character design is very appealing. It's not life changing or profound or deep, but it really doesn't need to be. To me it seems like Dreamworks set out to make a fun, cute film full of charm and they have very much accomplished that. Oh, and the incorporation of existing pop music in the film is witty and well planned. I'll be watching it many more times with my family and friends."

There are so many worse movies you could be roped into because of your kids too. But it also is really predictable and familiar. So it's not one of those movies that will outright be a waste of everyone's time. I think it has a target audience and it is good for that audience. But for general viewers, I wouldn't recommend this if they wanted to see an animated movie, a kids movie, or both. There are so many better movies that are much more worth your time but at the same time, there are plenty that are worse than this one."
