      "text": "This film is based on the 1976 hijacking when 248 passengers of an Air France flight were taken hostage and forced to land in Uganda. The narrative unfolds from both sides: the effort by 2 of the hijackers to maintain control of the hostages and the plans by the Israeli government to handle the situation. There's a lot of doubt and concern on one side and repetitive political discussion on the other. The natural potential for tension is never realized. Even the ultimate showdown, which is intercut with a contemporary dance number, is more frustrating than thrilling. The result is a listless encounter that will only be of interest only as a historical re-staging."

      "text": "Bruhl and Pike were the only decent thing about this film. It's your typical over-dramatization of a real-life event. Every character seems to state repeatedly how serious the situation is (on either side) and then the climax of the film happens in this awful slow motion with a needlessly added dance scene mixed in. There was a lot of bad choices with this movie. Slow paced, Poorly acted (outside of the two leads) and just not that interesting."

      "text": "This is a pathetic attempt to re write history and redo a much number of much better versions of the events surrounding this story.It reminds me of when \"The Sword of Gideon\" was remade by Spielberg and he and the writer added an entire scene to show the Humanity and \"other side\" of the terrorists. Attempting to humanize or justify their behaviour. Pathetic.I did give this a 1 because I do like the actors and they are very good at their respective craft. Otherwise I would have just given it a 0."

      "text": "Decent film, that seems to be getting poor reviews because it is too \"pro-hijackers\" or \"isreal negative\" by some, and by others annoying by the inter cutting of an interpretative dance routine.  I found issue with neither area, but the film did lack the explosive pacing that viewers come to expect from plane hostage films, and it also had some mediocre dialogue at times, and did not really shed much new insight onto the genre, except maybe examining the conflicting reasons some of the hijackers may have had, which was one of the  more interest aspects of the film.The film is really told from the hijackers perspective, and I think it is pretty neutral, doesn't take sides, which keeps it cool, and detached to some degree. It is fairly procedural, which slows down the pace for much of it as well.  Munich was a superior film about a similar subject matter, but this film explores more of the hijackers emotions, and adds a slight element.  The actors were also pretty good, despite a so-so script, and the compelling subject matter, and interpretive dance stuff, while over-handed, worked as well.  Good, but not great, film, especially worth seeing if you are not familiar with the events that occurred.  Just don't expect a riveting action packed hijack film for the duration, nor an Oscar type moral quandry such as Munich.   It is a decent film that balances things from the hijackers perspective mixed with the procedural response by the Isrealis."

      "text": "This is an amazing story. It is hard to believe you can write a bad script about it but this movie manages to combine pretty lousy dialogue  with mainly bad acting. This is on top of rewriting the hijackers as sensitive humanitarians. Even the climax is anti climactic.I rate this movie P for pathetic."

      "text": "An interesting film, especially if you didn\u2019t know anything about this hostage situation beforehand. I thought the acting was very good, especially Rosamund Pike, who was able to show much more nuance and emotion than the other actors, although that may have had more to do with the script than anything else. The big mistake in the film was the modern dance number that was repeated over and over again and was irritating and intrusive, except for the final time it was shown when the music (not the dancing) added to the emotions of the moment. Perhaps it was supposed to suggest Greek tragedy, but all it did was distract the audience and break the tension."

      "text": "In general, the film was made not bad, but what was it at the end? Was it necessary to insert this ridiculous dance into the scene of a special forces attack? And I was very surprised by the prime minister's phrase: you can congratulate us. we rescued the hostages!Sorry, but the purpose of the special operation was not the rescue of the hostages, but the unwillingness to release the prisoners. In the case of holding negotiations, the hostages would be in much more safer position."

The movie depicted correctly bombing 70's, with crazy Germans, Arabs and \"you-do-not-f-with-us\" Jews...the plot is well known but what really is eye pleasing is the craftsman of the director...this isn't Munich, this is more carefully knitted grandma's tablecloth that covers all - drama, action and psychological profiles of the characters....this movie is a \"go\" !"

      "text": "Lacks insight, but is well madeWritten by Gregory Burke and directed by Jos\u00e9 Padilha, Entebbe [released in North America as 7 Days in Entebbe] has met with near universally bad reviews (22% approval on Rotten Tomatoes at the time of writing), and while it is without doubt flawed, it's not nearly as bad as has been made out. Telling the story of the 1976 AirFrance hijacking by Palestinian and German revolutionaries, and the subsequent Israeli Defence Force rescue mission (Operation Thunderbolt), the film is presented from multiple points of view; Revolution\u00e4re Zellen members Brigitte Kuhlmann (Rosamond Pike) and Wilfried B\u00f6se (Daniel Br\u00fchl), Israeli Minister for Defence Shimon Peres (Eddie Marsan), Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin (an excellent Lior Ashkenazi), IDF Pvt. Zeev Hirsch (Ben Schnetzer), AirFrance 1st Engineer Jacques Le Moine (Denis M\u00e9nochet), IDF Lt. Col. Yoni Netanyahu (Angel Bonanni), and Ugandan President Idi Amin (Nonso Anozie).The problem is obvious; the film covers every point of view except the most important one; the Palestinian. Indeed, the only Palestinian given any kind of development is a fictional character played by Omar Berdouni, who talks of Israeli tanks driving over a car in which his family were trapped. And there are other strange omissions; the death of Dora Bloch (Trudy Weiss), murdered on Amin's orders after she was released in Kampala, is never mentioned, and Wadie Haddad is nowhere to be found. Additionally, the film doesn't have much of contemporaneous relevance to say in relation to the Arab-Israeli Conflict, other than alluding melancholically to the self-propagating nature of the violence, and the unlikelihood of peace (the closing legend points out that after he pushed for negotiations in 1995, Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist).However, it's aesthetically very well put together, and the juxtaposition of Thunderbolt with a Jewish dance number works much better than it has any right to. True, it doesn't get to the heart of the matter by any stretch of the imagination, and it could be accused of taking a pro-Israeli stance, but it's enjoyable enough, and worth a look."
