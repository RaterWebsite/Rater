      "text": "I loved the movie. The story was very interesting and I am a big fan of Bruce Willis and Cole Hauser. It does a good job of shining some light on one of humanity's darkest areas. The acting was good and overall a very enjoyable experience. We could've done without the strip club scene but thats what a fast forward button is for."

      "text": "Not a solid Action Thriller but entertaining enough. Hauser performs well, in other movies he did not convince me that much, Ashmore beyond handsomeness and very emotive sequences. 6'5/10"

I wish most of us, in America would stand up to what is wrong, in several ways.This movie is a odern version of \u201cSaving Private Ryan.\u201dIt reminds me of the best Christian film."
