      "text": "Based on a very dramatic event that got the globe coming together at the time praying that the astronauts would be okay, Apollo 13's realistic story and strong performances made it not-better-but-as-good-as the real event. Apollo 13 was supposed to be the third shuttle to land on the moon but an oxygen tank exploded and the astronauts found themselves in a real situation. Going through hell to get back to Earth, the guys finally made it and the world was happy. An interesting story but very simple. Thanks to writers William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert, the story became a complex challenge of life or death situation. Also helped by strong performances particularly from Ed Harris and Kathleen Quinlan, Apollo 13 became an instant classic when it came out in 1994."

      "text": "I did not like the movie one bit. First of all, most of the time it is just too obvious that this is a movie, the set looks way too artificial. Fake. Then, all the acting is too forced. Forced cool, forced dramatic, forced heavy, it is just too easy to see that these are actors acting. It is just never convincing. If every look, every word, and every movement wants to forcefully convey significance, everything becomes just too much. That is what happened with this movie. Together with the ever dramatic soundtrack, it becomes unbearable to watch. In addition, how close is this to the truth, that two of the crew members so obviously do not trust the third crew member ?\rIn all, there is no drama because every second is dramatic. No change in pace, no change in intensity. One you want to walk out of after 10 minutes.Quite a shame with that incredible cast."

It is a very well made movie, with great direction. But I ended up not caring at all about the 3 leads, in due to how boring this film is. i can handle boring, so long as I care about the characters. But I really didn't. The film does nothing to establish what these men are like. To us they are just random people who are in a space shuttle, and we don't care if they live or die."

But this movie goes in depth to show how it affected the people involved, not just the 3 astronauts, but their families and the ground crew trying to bring them back.  You talk about making tough decisions where it's life and death.  This included having the whole world watching.  That's pressure.  Who knew what the controllers and engineers at the Manned Flight Center were doing?  I don't have many DVDs but this one is in my collection."

The film is certainly slow at points, but for me, throughout, I was very intrigued by the film. From when they were preparing to when things start going wrong to the end, I was hooked. The film is never great, so to speak, but it was still very good and, while it needed no help in doing so, did a great job creating suspense when things went wrong, as well as sympathy for the families of the men aboard. The suspense is constant and really leaves you on the edge of your seat as you see the inner workings of the ordeal and it almost leaves you in tears as you watch their families deal with the ordeal back at home. Overall, a very enjoyable film that is not great, but is still very good."

      "text": "If Bob Dole and other industry critics want to continue attacking Hollywood, they\u2019d better not see \u201cApollo 13.\u201d With its rah-rah, gung-ho, can-do attitude and cast full of good-looking young white men in buzz cuts, this engrossing account of the nation\u2019s most perilous moon shot embodies what many people consider to be old-fashioned American virtues in a virtually pristine state. Sufficiently suspenseful despite its historically preordained happy ending,slightly overlong real-life thriller will appeal to mainstream audiences across the boards and land a commercial bull\u2019s-eye for Universal.\r Scarcely embellishing the story of how three astronauts barely avoided becoming the first Americans to die in outer space, director Ron Howard and his team walk a narrative line that\u2019s almost as narrow as the course of the mission itself. Pic\u2019s exceedingly linear structure, while unavoidable, renders it rather methodical and shallow in characterization. There is also something of the sense of the film as a live-action storyboard, so highly developed is its sense of organization and calculated effect.\r Nevertheless, the film works in a primal way as the story of three brave explorers who manage to find a way home in the face of hazardous obstacles and heavy odds. The verisimilitude with which the mission has been visualized is impressive, and the positive, virtuous, \u201cfailure-is-not-an-option\u201d posture of the characters has been adopted winningly by the entire cast and crew.\r Placing the opening scenes in a family context manages the twin feats of conveying some needed exposition and establishing the film\u2019s wholesome credentials. A bunch of NASA personnel and their kin assemble to watch the dramatic moment on July 20, 1969, when Neil Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon. The host, family man Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), was aboard Apollo 8 when it passed just 60 nautical miles above the moon, and he\u2019s only got to wait nine more months to get his chance to become the fifth man to set foot on the lunar surface.\r As the April 11, 1970, launch date approaches, command module pilot Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) is exposed to measles and has to be replaced by swinging bachelor Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon). But by the time they and lunar module pilot Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) blast off on their 600,000-mile trip, the public has come to regard moon missions as almost routine and worthy of only passing interest.\r Two-and-a-half days later, and 50 minutes into the picture, this attitude abruptly changes. During a routine \u201cstirring\u201d of the oxygen supply, an oxygen tank explodes, which quickly leads to three significant problems for the crew: a dissipating oxygen supply, reduced power on board and a filtering system on the blink, leaving the men susceptible to carbon dioxide poisoning.\r Through this critical portion of the six-day mission, events in Houston prove considerably more dramatic than goings-on in space, where the men shiver and await the fateful moment when they must attempt re-entry. A number of nicely individualized scientists and nerdy computer geniuses argue the merits of different courses of action, with Kranz making the ultimate decisions through a sort of consensus by decree. While chain-smoking flight director Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) overseas the rescue operation,  some of the key contributions are made by Mattingly.\r Physically, \u201cApollo 13\u201d pulls off some stunners, notably the giant rocket launch, the separation of the boosters as the spaceship soars away from Earth, the views of the moon and scenes of weightlessness that were filmed aboard a high-flying Air Force plane that afforded the actors brief moments of zero gravity. Kudos to the special effects hands at Digital Domain, production designer Michael Corenblith, costume designer Rita Ryack and the army of technicians on board for an outstanding display of authenticity. Dean Cundey\u2019s lensing works to seamlessly blend f/x work with normal scenes, but look of the images leans toward the grainy and soft.\r Casting Hanks as Lovell gives the film a human center, someone with whom the audience can easily feel at home, but his dramatic opportunities are more limited here than of late. His most powerful scene has him calming down his two partners when their dilemma threatens to get the better of them late in the journey.\r Bacon brings a colorful cockiness to the one \u201cTop Gun\u201d-style flyer in the bunch, while Paxton is obliged to suffer quietly with a high fever during much of the journey. Harris\u2019 coiled tension provides a strong focus of attention in the control room, and Kathleen Quinlan gives depth of feeling and understanding to the necessarily compartmentalized role of Lovell\u2019s omen-fearing wife.\r \u201cApollo 13\u201d will inevitably be compared to the only previous large-scale film about the U.S. space program, 1983\u2019s \u201cThe Right Stuff.\u201d  New effort is much more succinct and conventional in its aims and will no doubt play more successfully with the public."

Ron Howard makes it look like easy and effortless through his brilliant execution skills but unfortunately isn't supported well enough on the editing department. Tom Hanks leads the way with another stellar performance from his side and is supported by a great cast like Ed Harris and Kevin Bacon. Apollo 13 isn't as important or nail biting as the makers think but it surely is witty and thought provoking that was just piled upon by the undercooked emotions like it was essential to install."

      "text": "This movie tells the story of the Apollo 13 mission, one of the most famous missions to the Moon, not because of it's success but because it almost became a disaster.The script is based on actual facts and could be somewhat boring for those who don't know the theme but, since everything was barbarously simplified, anyone understands it quickly. Unfortunately, this effort to synthesize and simplify has made the plot unrealistic, predictable and forced, especially if we take into account the jokes around number 13 and other minor situations like that. The plot gives great attention to how the astronauts was prepared and chosen, as well as how NASA sweated to bring them back. In this field, the film is engaging and leaves the audience stuck to the screen. Another issue that it tackles, in obvious criticism, is the initial lack of interest from the media in that mission, but this is ancillary. The film has some special effects but they're not attractive or stunning except for scenes in zero gravity. Personally, I didn't have any problem with that, I think it leaves more room for drama.As for actors we need to consider the following: the cast is full of stars (Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris...) but the film definitely doesn't know what to do with them. Hanks is the protagonist but is misused and spends more than half the film's length wishing for the Moon and trying to control his flight colleagues. Ed Harris, in a supporting character, shines almost as much as him and holds the final half of the movie in an excellent performance, but within the standards the actor has accustomed us to. The rest of the cast does not shine and there are several supporting actors who end up being demoted to extras with lines.In conclusion: it's a satisfactory movie but its far from being really good. The blend of a strong cast, a script reduced to the basic and an uninspired direction is as inefficient as a Ferrari engine in a Beetle."

The astronauts have to overcome situations no human on Earth has had to deal with, and the movie shows this in great detail. That's a treat to see.The acting is well done, especially by Ed Harris playing Gene. He's shows leadership, a positive and calm attitude and probably saved the astronauts with those qualities. The scenes with control and the shuttle are very entertaining.However... the scenes with THE WIFE are extremely annoying. Besides the fact that Jim Lovel's wife in this movie has the worst haircut i've seen in a long time, she interupts the interesting scenes repeatedly with staring at radio's and tv's. We get it, you are worried about your husband... but that should not have been shown this much. And that also goes for that particular school kid who looks like he's trying to catch flies with his open mouth.By the end of the movie you'll feel like it would have been a better movie without the harrasing of the wife scenes, but it does keep you on the edge of your seat.
