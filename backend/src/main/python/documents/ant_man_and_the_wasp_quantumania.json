Despite their now strained relationship Lang contacts Pym and, along with Pym\u2019s daughter Hope, they set out to investigate who and where the message is coming from.    Ant Man and the Wasp without doubt suffered for being released between Infinity War and Endgame, and it hardly reinvents the Marvel formula, but with its creative action sequences, sense of humour and stellar cast it's a solid movie in it\u2019s own right and a worthy addition to the MCU."

      "text": "This movie needed more sets. It felt like 3/4 of the movie took place in Ant Man's home or the Wasp and her father's laboratory. There was also a 'quantum realm' but it was shown for only a few minutes. I like intimate personal stories, especially when super heroes are involved, because too much super hero-ing without knowing the characters gets very dull very fast. However, was there a reason the movie could not have included a broader range of environments? And the two main actors all need a little more spark, an espresso at least, before filming. The movie was strangely low energy, despite all the shrinking and growing and fighting. I can't imagine such a problem if the movie starred, say, Robert Downy Junior and Margot Robbie. Those two have so much personality. But here something - something besides the relatively few sets - was missing. It wasn't the plot, the plot with a full range of sets of bad guys of varying degrees, was well done. But some element of personality and/or energy was lacking. All that said, Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer did their jobs well. Both leads, though, were missing something I can't define. Maybe chemistry between them was lacking. That could be it. They're supposed to be in love but, I didn't feel it."

I went to watch this, because of the generally favourable reviews. Boy was I in for a great disappointment. This doesn't feel like a good Marvel film. It's all mindless action from beginning to the end. Chasing after the miniature of the lab building like a game of soccer. It's so bad that it feels like a 90s grade B movie, eg a little like 'Spy Kids', all actions and no depth.I do like some of the lines which are genuinely funny and natural. A few lines are rather cheesy. Character development is close to none, meaning you get stereotyped characters which feels like they are only there to fill the roles. It's a very bad thing if you watch a movie and don't feel inclined to care about its characters, unlike the Avengers series. The villains are especially boring and seriously under developed.I wished I have never gone to watch this."

And the wasp pretty much stole the show. Ant-man didn't really do anything in the film, and the wasp do everything. The villain looks like a character from Destiny and she can literally just talk to Hank and Hope to figure out a way with her issues instead of fighting them. And about two third of the movie's joke didn't land. The mob characters in the movie and laughable and get their ass whooped by the wasp and ghost, I don't know why they are even in the movie.

After Infinity War we needed a light hearted and fun film which is exactly what this is. The daughter, played by Abby Ryder, is great and steals every scene she is in. The villains are are ok and one of them is basically useless and could have been taken out of the film entirely. The action is well done and the choreography is spot on. There is a lot to like about this film and the ending hints at what is to come, which is really exciting to think about.

Its worse than the original Ant-man which at least had a coherent story and was made with enough care given its development troubles with Edgar Wright. Peyton Reed shows his limitations in this film where the plot doesn't really matter, the characters dont really have any arcs (or if there are any, its literally the same as the first film). There nothing really to say except its a paint by number Marvel formulaic film meaning: jokes every 2 minutes, convoluted plot, borderline terrible generic CGI, characters that are charming but lack any emotional heft, dumb villains and character you will quickly forget and a wooden plot you can probably write better in an hour. Again, there some good action, some good lines and yeah the same stuff. AMATW doesn't add anything to the ongoing Marvel storyline, in fact you just need to see the end-credit scene for any sort of narrative weight to matter. I wish we could go back to the OG marvel films like Iron Man, Captain America:First Avenger or even Civil War where the films had a good narrative, character interactions and well-made scenes. It seems a long time ago now that those films actually felt like films. Now they all feel like **** episodes of a generic TV show. If Marvel continues this trend, it will be the law of diminishing returns."

      "text": "The cutest Marvel movie. Very low-stakes. What I liked about the first Ant-Man is that it wasn't so much a superhero flick as it was a heist film with superpowers. Once again, Lang and crew aren't out to save the world or stop a supervillain. They're just trying to do some science stuff and people keep getting in their way. This more self-centered approach taken by the protagonists allows them to stand out a bit from their numerous costumed peers. They never stray too far from the established MCU formula though.The action makes great use of the characters' ability to manipulate size. Although outside of a few exceptions most of the best set-pieces were spoiled in the trailer. That car chase is actually the biggest sequence in the movie. The humor is very safe and like much of the MCU's third phase it's one of the defining factors of the experience. I laughed a lot, but most of the early material falls flat because Rudd seems to be phoning it in. Something he does on and off. Michael Douglas is also guilty of this.The plot deals a lot with the fallout of Civil War. The characters were really affected by Scott's involvement which serves as a driving factor for him to fix everything. The constant references to that earlier film makes sense given where this sequel falls in the MCU's overall timeline, but it's also kind of detrimental as it makes the movie feel more dated than it actually is. Infinity War just happened and everyone is still caught up in that. We've moved on from The Avengers one-time squabble amongst themselves.At the same time I kind of like this smaller-scaled approach that feels more detached from the rest of the heroes. It allows us to have sweet moments of father-daughter bonding between Lang and his little girl while he struggles with his non-heroic pals at keeping a business going. Some down-to-earth, real life stuff that distinguishes Ant-Man as more of your average guy. His fellow ex-cons might not actually contribute anything to the plot, but it's nice to see to some regular dudes amongst all of the extraordinary happenings. Especially when they're so darn funny. Randall Park is a gift in this.One thing Marvel has really been listening to and trying to work on are the villains. There's still a ways yet to go, but things have been on the rise in this department ever since Peter Parker got his long-awaited MCU standalone. \"Ghost\" is another example of this steady improvement. Mostly because she's not actually a bad person. Her motives are understandable and even sympathetic. They just so happen to put her at odds with our heroes. I would have loved to have learned more about her background in S.H.I.E.L.D. and want to see her character come back as an ally to further enrich the cast. Same for Fishburne.Definitely one of the safer Marvel movies, but after Infinity War it's nice to see something solely concerned with doing it's own thing. This is actually one of the more eccentric sides of the MCU. Giant ants run around and people explore another dimension they call the \"Quantam Realm.\" A place I really want them to reveal more information about as it's even more interesting than the depths of space we've seen a bunch of by now alongside the Guardians and Thor. It's almost pure silliness across the board and that's fun, but sometimes it can be a little too goofy for it's own good. The inconsequential nature of the movie is actually a positive factor that increased my overall enjoyment.7.6/10"

It felt underwritten, incredibly inconsequential, and the stakes just didn't seem very high for anyone.  The Ghost character and storyline is completely unecessary and the forced conflict between Scott and the gang at the beginning really doesn't make sense.  Wasp is underwritten and dull considering Lillys talents.  It was ok, I would still have purchased a ticket - but it did not have the vibrancy and drive of the first film.   Luckily the scenes with Rudd and his family and Luis continue to connect.  It doesnt have the humour of Ragnarok, the character of Guardians or the heart of Cap Amer - its just sort of the bland, slightly funny middle.  Seems more like missed opportunity."

This supposed inferiority is due to his being labelled a, \"criminal,\" and sentanced to jail time for righting a wrong committed by a former employer. His further, \"wrong doing,\" SPOILER ALERT was going to join the fight in Civil War, without letting his girlfriend know.While I can see why should would be upset, it doesn't seem worthy of this sort of total rejection of him. For some reason anytime his character does anything anyone questions he is treated as the total failure and f***up, supposedly because of his prior, \"criminal,\" act. However, all of his actions were in essence heroic. He is a clearly loving, engaged, and arguably ethically ideal role model to his daughter, and always makes the right heroic choices in his film. Still he is treated as less-than.To me it is sad that this sort of treatment goes unquestioned in our society. It seems to reflect the truth that father's are generally treated as comedic relief in pop culture and scapegoats.While men headline Marvel movies, for the most part they are emblematic of problems that are at least equal to women in fiction if not worse for the fact they go unrecognized. It is sad that often times people laugh at the concept of a Men's Movement or the need to examine gender norms and expectations as applied to men in our country. It is fairly obvious that our culture has a tremendous problem with, \"men.\""

Well, think of it this way: we\u2019re focused right now on one of those films that utilizes the actors\u2019 blocking to signify sexual tension in a dumb way that leaves nothing to the imagination. Likewise, no true written or directed coordination puts anything at stake here, its excessive jokes left to treat ants more humane than any actual humans on screen. Maybe if the humans\u2019 motivations were realistic, then these absurd circumstances could turn somewhat believable?Here are some examples. The foul script particularly turns Hope\u2019s (the Wasp) father, Hank, into a dislikable boss who throws everything beneath his feet without compassionate support, serving a small part of bland stereotypes. Another part of those stereotypes includes the FBI worker who suddenly searches Scott\u2019s (Ant-Man) home, resembling an evasive insect as opposed to a legitimate character. The same describes the leads: while Hope does get to kick butt, she later becomes nothing beyond a slightly sex\u2019d down love interest to the male lead. Thus, you\u2019ll get the feel of mental pests plaguing your brain nerves, ants sent through your eyeballs to break apart your cerebrum for nest eggs.So what does Ant-Man and the Wasp succeed at? Well, one early scene shows Scott entertaining his daughter Cassie in a cardboard recreation of his previous adventure, alongside his magic tricks that keep up its own consistent story arc. Yes, the father-daughter instances satisfy enough to make you want to see these two together, especially once spur-of-the-moment FBI searches interrupt their time together. To further sentimentalize the personal touches, he nicknames her, \u201cPeanut,\u201d much like how Hope\u2019s parents call her \u201cJellybean,\u201d and Cassie calls her dad, \u201cWorld\u2019s Greatest Grandma.\u201d Besides the main families, the key villain, Ava (or \u201cGhost\u201c), whose cells suffer molecular disequilibrium, connects to heartbreaking results with her adopted dad.Of course, being a Marvel property, you should expect laughs aplenty; memorable gags turn small things giant and vice versa, chuckles a guarantee when Scott gets stuck to half his size in an elementary school. Michael Pe\u00f1a (American Hustle, Crash) delivers some nice rapid-fire comedy too during his funny narration on truth serum. Plus, Peyton Reed\u2019s (Ant-Man) direction meets expectations based on how he utilizes the Wasp\u2019s powers to memorable results against bad guys. Then inside the quantum realm, colossal tardigrades lunge toward you, creating a surreal environment Michelle Pfeiffer\u2019s (Dangerous Liaisons, The Fabulous Baker Boys) acceptable portrayal complements satisfactorily. Yet let me say: she looks ridiculously young! Not a wrinkle anywhere! Do they have an anti-aging salon in the quantum realm because she looks just like one of those formerly famous Hollywood actresses who\u2019s trying to hard to stay relevant! Oh wait\u2026I know you hate it when I trash on Marvel, but it still fails to be art because of how much a lazy corporate product it is. Marvel may be tremendous at the whole marketing strategy, yet its familiar shiny flaw-free world comes off inauthentic under its excessive, random pop culture references. Not to mention it will not make this film age well, considering the products of the cinematic universe will last far longer than the company\u2019s profits. These producers trying to make stuff cool takes priority over practicality, forcing chuckles from scientifically educated viewers by the carelessness of how the science talk is treated. Heck, a shrunken car matches the speed of regular sized ones for crying out loud! So even though slight emotional doses ground the viewer\u2019s optimism, the willful suspension of disbelief runs way off track.Yeah, I understand, I must avoid overthinking a summer popcorn movie, except the nauseous editing by Dan Lebental (Ant-Man, Iron Man) and Craig Wood (Guardians of the Galaxy, Pirates of the Caribbean) ramble on lame humor rather than slowing down to linger on the pain. It\u2019s not enjoyable when desires inappropriately go to quick plot point progression, the only hint of deceleration present when slow-motion knives are thrown.It appears even the performers themselves didn\u2019t want to get to know their roles well. Instead of acting jittery, Paul Rudd causes serious discomfort as Michael Douglas\u2019 (Fatal Attraction, Wall Street) weak motivation spurts out unintentionally funny angry outbursts towards his colleagues. Worst above all, not one single believable relationship holds up the entire feature, that includes the necessary fear of a family crisis built between Ant-Man and Ava.But good news! You have need to set sail through Marvel\u2019s shipwrecked celebration of American pride. It\u2019s summer for crying out loud, ride a bike! Enjoy the sun!"

This film offers alot in its comedy, visuals and strong performances which is surprising considering the trailers left alot to be desired. Ghost had the look of a cool villain but she was a step down from Killmonger and Thanos as she didn't really feel like a villain as much as she did a sympathetic  anti-hero."

I wish Ant man shrunk more throughout the movie and that the wasp had a bigger part to play. Still at no point did i want to stop watching it. ( Why is it that ant man seems more  scientifically possible then the other MCU heroes?? )"

I hate that feeling in a movie theater when the writers clearly thought they had a gem of a gag and the audience stays silent.  Cringe-worthy!Stuffed-In Bad Guy: There's generic corrupt corporate bad-guy named Sonny Burch who apparently was in Iron Man III but did not achieve much of an impact in that movie either because I can't even remember him.  The actor was fine, but the character wasn't necessary.The Good:The best character was Hope Pym(Wasp)- she was a total bad-ass, quite the opposite of fumbling and bumbling Scott Lang, who we love seeing grope his way blindly through life and his action scenes.  The Wasp probably laid out more fodder than Captain America in his first movie.  In addition her relationship with her dad was much improved, and it was nice to see that carried through from the end of the last film.  The seemed like a real family.Ghost:  I want to see this character again; she was something I was not prepared to process.  Her backstory is compelling and Hannah Johm Kamen nails it to perfection.  I thought about Ghost more than any other character after I left the theater.  Love the effects on her as well as her impressive array of powers.Humor: Although I dissed this aspect of the movie above, overall the writing was above average.  There are some truly memorable funny moments as well as a few duds.  The good outweighs the bad here.Lawrence Fishburn: Great to see one of my favorite actors rocking the Goliath character.  Unlike many add-on characters to sequels I felt that he wasn't just made up to plug a hole in a script.The Kid: Wow, how do I hate cute kids in action movies.  But for some reason this kid isn't annoying - in fact she's naturally cute and funny.  Perhaps it's because she doesn't act sassy and say adult lines which are developmentally unrealistic from a psychological perspective.  Her lines are what a kid her age might actually say.Randall Park as Jimmy Woo: Another terrific addition to the cast, Officer Woo had some of the funniest lines in the film.  I'd love to see this guy again in other MCU movies.  He sucks at cards though...The Action - Especially the End Sequence:  The effects are spectacular, the editing is spot on, and I couldn't find any major plot holes with how everything turned out.Fan Boy Cred:  I spent a large portion of my childhood actually reading the comics these characters are based on and I've romanticized it in my head for decades.  To me, this film - along with many of the other higher quality MCU films - honored the source material."

      "text": "Ant-man and the wasp was a sequel that I was really looking forward mainly because I loved the first ant-man, I thought it stood out compared to most MCU movies and was unique in its own way.  So is this film good, yes it is, it's not a great movie but I still do really enjoy this movie.  Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly work very well together and both give their best while performing.  Michael douglas and Michael Pena are funny and bring some great one liners and that's something I can give a big praise to in this movie, the humour is always on point and doesn't feel forced and misused.  The action scenes are fun and exactly what I wanted to see, the gorgeous visuals and well planned use of cgi never make these scenes feel fake or poorly adapted on the screen. Now as I said this movie is good but I had a lot of problems with it, the shows villains are very cliche and follow the same villain routes and plan outs that you would see in a cartoon show.  They also try to make the film feel very serious and dark, but it never pulls off, either its because paul rudd lets off a one liner or michael pena starts talking and their is never any real tensity.  One of my other big issues was how they treated the character of ant-man.  In the first film we see that he is fairly smart, he's no genius but he is smart, but in this film they treat ant-man almost like and idiot and I didn't like that, he's always the one to make a dumb decision, or not do something correctly and that felt a bit off putting for me.But overall I do suggest go checking this one out, I did enjoy this movie I don't like it quite as much as the first but it is still a blast to watch and I'm sure will please most followers of the MCU."
