      "text": "Think a mash-up of \"Superman,\" \"Big\" and \"Jumanji\"... Yes, spoilers ahead if you keep reading. I very much enjoyed this film. Zach Levi (from \"Chuck\") was born to play this role.  My only criticism of his performance is that the younger (non-Shazam) version of himself is cynical, shrewd, and not all that funny - he's been through a lot having been abandoned by his mother, so it makes sense. When he's in the BIG role, he's much more, for lack of a better word, \"goofy.\" The consistency is not there, but this didn't kill it for me.  Much more importantly, the casting director found Jack Dylan Grazer to play Freddy Freeman.  Believe it or not, he's the beating heart of this film. Brilliant work- extremely funny but not in the typical \"sassy teen\" way.  If you can't feel for him, everything else falls apart. I also absolutely loved Cooper Andrews (Jerry from The Walking Dead) and Marta Milans as the foster parents. They're more tangibly \"real\" than any other parents in these superhero flicks. Believe it or not, Mark Strong is only OK in this film.  Sure, he's the bad guy, and they give him a really good back story which I won't spoil, but he doesn't bring a unique spin to the all-powerful menacing force. I also liked exacxtly how they acknowledge the other existing DC superheroes in this world - Batman, Superman, etc. are a \"thing\", but they handle it in a very organic way - if you're  a fan of thse things, you'll smile. BIGGER spoiler (without giving too much up)....  When the entire family goes through their \"thing\" toward the end, the casting director did a phenomenal job - all those new parts are all perfectly cast. Love all those actors - particularly Michelle Borth (Hawaii 5-0) and Meagan Good. Triumphant ending. Recommended for sure."

Shazam is just a hell of a lot of fun.  It's funny, it's quick, and the actors are all incredibly sympathetic.  The concept is simple but entirely effective. My sneak preview screening was met by roars of approval, big laughs, and applause at the end.  If you're going to see it, by all means, stay for the credit sequence (with a bad-ass Ramones song underlying it).  Clearly,  the makers of this movie are comic book lovers."

This movie had a great story, great characters, solid jokes, a good script, and a lot of heart! It reminded me a lot of Spider-Man Homecoming. It\u2019s a much smaller-scale superhero story, focussing on a small cast of characters and not existing solely to set up sequels. *cough*Batman v Superman*cough* I really like how authentic this movie felt. It takes place in a universe where superheroes exist, but they aren\u2019t going around flying everywhere. The connections to the other movies are loose. That\u2019s probably what a universe full of superheroes would really be like. They would be rare. You wouldn\u2019t see them every day. The Marvel Cinematic Universe doesn\u2019t really feel that way to me. It\u2019s missing that human element of what it\u2019s like to live in a universe full of heroes and gods just as a regular average citizen. Maybe that\u2019s why I don\u2019t really like the MCU that much. Maybe that\u2019s why Ioved Spider-Man Homecoming so much. I like stories about regular people living in larger-than-life universes. Anyway, back to Shazam, this is a must-see for any fan of superheroes and family comedies! Maybe don\u2019t take the little ones though. I was kinda surprised, this movie looks really kid-friendly, it has a main cast of mostly child actors who do a really good job, but it actually has some really scary parts! There were kids crying in my theatre. Just a heads-up. All that aside, I loved this movie, it\u2019s a ton of fun. Highly recommended! Now the only movie from the DCEU I haven\u2019t seen is Man of Steel. (I finally watched Wonder Woman. It\u2019s good.) Should I go watch it or should I let my positive feelings for the DCEU stay a little longer? Hmm..."

(Bus scene was a great idea, but handled poorly)Then the action sequences took a child cartoon approach. (for obvious reasons) Which drastically hurt the last bit of the movie for me. (Ironically, most people enjoyed the ending, and hated the start. But then again, most super hero fans tend to like action, and I tend to find it boring, if nothing interesting is happening.)The ending could have been a massive success, if they copied ONE thing from the marvel movies. (Sadly I can't say what it is, otherwise knowing it doesnt contain this, is a sort of spoiler.) But like the rest of the movie, the ending has a GREAT idea, and handled it poorly. (probably to save on money.)RATING: 70% Above average, and mostly enjoyable.Semi comparable to Thor3, humor wasnt as spot on as Thor3, but the actual plot was more interesting than Thor3."

It looked like a good movie from the trailers.  I was wrong.  Mainly, this is a movie for teenagers or younger possibly (pg-13 though?).  The plot was very basic, clearly written to a child's level.  The villain was pretty lame and barely dangerous. A lot of downtime where nothing seemed to be going on, it was boring at times.  The dialogue was cringey at times, seemed lazy or just poorly written, however realizing at the end that this was a kids movie, probably just dumbed down.  I seriously considered turning it off around half-way through.  Honestly not sure I'm going to give DC movies another chance.  Very disappointing."

The villain is really poor, the bad bad guy. The film doesn't have a very complex plot, the guy is thirsty for power and wants the ones that the protagonist has and uses the 7 deadly sins (which are mythological monsters) to try to get them. It touches very important issues about the true meaning of family and heroism. It reminds us of The Goonies, Stand By Me, The Greatest American Hero and Big. Wonder Woman is better but this one is better than Aquaman. Same light and cool tone since Justice League and this is the perfect path that DC found to compete against Marvel. The movie is very long, in the middle it becomes heavy and slow, 1 hour and 45 minutes would have been better."

It wildly succeeds in what it sets out to do because it understands that there is nothing childish about childhood or children's entertainment. Irregardless of the invulnerability of its title character or the power fantasy inherent in the superhero genre, the film embraces a disarming vulnerability and emotional intelligence. The movie never forgets that while childhood is full of wonder, humor and escapism, it is also full of fear, loneliness, and struggle. Where other recent comic book movies are built behind a smug aura of \"cool face,\" cheap sentimentality, or winking humor, Shazam! earns its  attitude and big laughs by leaning in to the humanity, complex emotions, and social longing inherent in comic book mythology. The film is decidedly on a smaller scale that what we've come to expect in the genre, both in times of budget, star power, and 'end of the world' dramatics, but rather than diminishing the impact of the film, it heightens the very real and emotionally powerful stakes of family and friendship."

      "text": "'Shazam!' is an easy movie to love, and that's because it is told through the eyes of young teenagers who aspire to be noble and powerful heroes, the spirit of this film is what keeps it alive. The story centers around a young, 14 year old boy named Billy Batson (Asher Angel) who is alone, and is searching for his mother ever since they were separated when he was just a young boy. He is then forced to bond with a new foster family after having a reputation for running away numerous times, but decides to finally settle in. His new family is big, many different siblings of various ages and personalities, the one he gets closest to is Freddy (Jack Dylan Grazer), who is a big fan of superheroes and collects all kinds of special merchandise, even right down to the bullet that Superman himself deflected. Billy struggles at first with his new family and school, but is still motivated to find his mother. We also meet Dr. Thaddeus Sivana (Mark Strong), who, when he was a child, he encountered the wizard Shazam (Djimon Hounsou) and was cast out as he could not resist evil, and was deemed not worthy to possess such great power. He manages to get himself back in and snatch the evil power, and the wizard must find someone truly worthy enough to defeat Sivana. That is where things get interesting for our young Billy, as he also comes across the mysterious temple and is told what he must do, when he says \"Shazam!\", he turns into a fully grown-up superhero (now played by Zachary Levi), but still has the mind of his own, young self. What really surprised me about this movie was how charming, heartwarming and funny it all is. Directed by David F. Sandberg ('Lights Out' and 'Annabelle: Creation'), the movie's tone is surprisingly light and much different than what he maybe used to. Despite maybe one or two moments when we constantly cut back and forth between Billy and Sivana, it can feel like two different movies, making it tonally uneven, but that's just a small percentage. The movie mainly works because of its youthful spirit. Teenagers always wanted to be a hero, and how Levi plays a 14 year old trapped in a 30 year old's body and his reaction to everything from super strength, to flying, really adds to the movie's joyful quality. The third act also, can get a little too cheesy at times, but maybe that's intentional, overall, this is pretty much 'Big' (1988) meets 'Superman' (1978), also, it does remind me of 'Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse' (2018) and that's a high compliment. It knows the concept is a little silly, it embraces its light spirit, and it has fun with the material, like how most kids have fun when they use some powerful piece of technology. Imagine if you were a kid, and you found out you could fly and have super strength. This movie is a joy to behold."

Good final battle but I think they overdued to show the full potencial of character. Overall, a good movie."

Action and comedy are well balanced and there are some horror moments too. Lots of heart. I had a big smile throughout the movie. Every character had their moment to shine."
