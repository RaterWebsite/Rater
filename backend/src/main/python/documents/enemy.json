Some scenes drag on for too long and the initial beauty of the first scene is not repeated often during the film"

The opening line on the screen is: \"Chaos is order undeciphered\", so you know not everything is going to be spelled out to you in linear form (i.e. beginning, middle, end). It's moody (incredible photography, score) harkens back to great noirs and reminds me of The Game as directed by Cronenberg.

However, when you think something interesting or dramatic is going to happen, it just falls flat instead.  They have so many opportunities to create a passionate or fascinating scene, but choose to go with watered down drudgery instead.  WHY?  Then, at the end, it's as if they can't muster up a real ending to this one-way street to Boringville, so they just randomly decide to throw in a gigantic spider to eat the pregnant chic (but you don't even get to SEE IT happen... zzzzz). The End. I thought this was the worst movie ever... until I watched Under the Skin... even worse!"

People will be split on their feelings of \"Enemy,\" those who are willing to sit through a very slow paced and simple story may or may not be rewarded with an abstract puzzle that awaits to be deciphered. I did appreciate the slow paced build-up, yet was a bit disappointed at the amount of plot closure the film gave us. French-Canadian director, Denis Villeneuve's use of intense sounds and music with summer blockbuster-like camera shots contrasted greatly with the slow character driven and psychologically oriented story. It seemed as if the director was unsure of what kind of a movie he was making. The screenplay was very simple, yet very complicated, and that is greatly credited to Jake Gyllenhaal's performance, or should I say performances? The Toronto skyline setting added a suspenseful and ghost-town atmosphere to the movie, which is peculiar as Toronto is a loud and busy metropolis in reality. But perhaps the film is trying to convey that nothing is as it seems. Although Villeneuve chooses to not leave behind answers to creepy crawling questions, he gives you just enough tools to answer them yourself."

It was unique, weird, and incredibly confusing, but that is what makes it fun at the end of the day. I love films that leave you wondering, \"What the hell did I just watch?\" and this one fits the bill to a t. Jake Gyllenhaal is phenomenal here as Adam Bell and Anthony Claire. He plays these two different, but very similar men brilliantly and is able to switch between the two at the drop of a hat, which is really cool to watch. In addition, it is gorgeously filmed. I loved the lighting at night and, on top of that, the shots during the day are also very beautiful. It truly is eye candy. It also functions great as a psychological thriller as, even though it slow going in the beginning, when it kicks into high gear, you are left wondering \"Wtf wtf wtf wtf\" as events unfold. This was one of my most anticipated films of 2014 and now that I have finally been able to see it, it does not disappoint at all.

Which will also lead to disappointment for the majority because it was detached from entertainment in the far distance. You can call it an art movie, but the materials used for the story were somehow stronger. I mean for the grown ups and especially for a man with patience. It deal about a middle aged man and his world of desires towards sex and irresponsibility in the life he lives.\r It was adapted from a novel called 'The Double'. Looks like the title was not available then changed it to 'Enemy'. Not a bad title either, but slightly misleads especially after watcher 'Prisoners'. Adam is a history professor and his life is a less joyous. His mother is worried about him for being careless. One day by chance he discovers something while watching a movie that knocks his inner consciousness. He begins to give more interest on it and prepare to solve the mystery. The venture he's after is supposed to take place smoothly, but it didn't. Hits back to his life and scatters the pieces of his own identity.\r \u2018\u2018Never know how your day\ris gonna turn out.\u2019\u2019\r I must make you understand that it was like a jigsaw puzzle. The story just happens and it won't expose completely with proper description. Like the outer layer of a fruit, but inside there are lots of stuffs to figure it out by ourselves. If you are a smart enough, you will sketch your own conclusion by joining the pieces. For that you may need to watch twice. Revealing my opinion may end in spoiler, but wanted to say that the story was programmed to handle a man's irresponsibility and desire. Both were symbolically exposed its identity and rest of the things leaves for the audience to observe closely, otherwise you will miss the important point.\r I yet to watch 'The Double', the description kind of match to this. Nowadays this thing keeps happening frequently like recently ones 'Olympus Has Fallen' and 'White House Down'. Anyway, Jake Gyllenhaal was awesome in this movie. Almost 90 per cent of the movie frames had captured his presence. Without a doubt its a one man show. He's becoming a great personality in Hollywood, but it was not a Hollywood flick. Finally, one more time I will remind you that it is not a piece of cake for everyone, choose it if you are not preferring entertainment."

The film is a mind bender for sure but it is maybe best to go into viewing with this in mind. Jake Gyllenhaal\u2019s character is battling something; what I will not spill. He must deal with it and fix the problem. The film also heavily links itself with dictatorship and women, so take note of this and watch the screen carefully. Basically, without spoiling anything, the films message and themes are executed in maybe a bit too indistinguishable way but once you\u2019ve figured it out it becomes an incredibly interesting film.\rThe films pacing wasn\u2019t too bad but then it was only 86 minutes so it didn\u2019t have to worry itself about that too much. Directing was very nice and really helped highlight the films message visually. The acting was good all round, but nothing extremely award worthy here. Most enjoyably is the last 15 minutes of the film, which are perfectly delivered for the audience to sit there tensely and afterwards deliberate over; and with this comes one of the creepiest and scariest finales I have ever witnessed!\rSound design and the soundtrack to the film add exquisitely to the films tone and atmosphere, but doesn\u2019t overpower itself. The dark and brooding atmosphere feels like something out of a Fincher classic.\rOverall the film is well worth the watch but with maybe not too friendly a viewing for people don\u2019t don\u2019t want to think too hard the film is not too easily accessible, quite an elitist film perhaps. I would give this film a 7.6ish or a bit more, and so will round up to 8. I don\u2019t believe the film has warranted itself an 8 but it Is definitely more than a 7 and better than what some people have made it out to be. Very enjoyable but not easily digestible; Will take a few bites.\r7.6/10"

      "text": "An amazing movie. It made me feel and think. It leads the viewer down a dark and curious path. And the feeling stays with you as you think about the movie for days afterwords. This is art. It is not for people looking for an anesthesia in the form of mindless action-comedy. Most amazingly it makes Mississauga look fascinating and mysterious."
