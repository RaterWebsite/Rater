Cons: May seem a tad bit filthy to some parents; unfortunately, it influenced the hundreds of Shrek-wannabes your kiddies crave."

      "text": "I remember this being controversial with more conservative parents when it first released for being marketed towards children, but having a lot of adult humor. I can understand why. Shrek is pretty blatant with it's sexual innuendos and profanity. I wouldn't show it to really little kids either. Probably only the more discerning tweenagers and up.Shrek skewers fairy tale tropes with it's sarcastic sense of humor without ever straying too far away from them. The idea being to allow the outcasts to finally get their happily ever after ending while simultaneously giving a sullen middle finger to the beautiful people who almost have one handed to them. That's what works for me with Shrek. I'm an ugly guy who has always been judged for both my appearance and the fact that I don't act like everyone else does. This movie showed me a protagonist with similar qualities and allowed him to find friendship, true love, and grow as a person (Er... Ogre).And isn't that the point of fairy tales? To enchant listeners with stories where anyone downtrodden can have hope? Why is it then that most of the time only the 10/10 hotties have been able to get a happy ending?Shrek is an escapism fantasy for those who don't typically get to have one outside of what they imagine for themselves."

While I think this film would be enjoyable to children there are many jokes in it that are aimed at an adult audience that grew up in the 70s or 80s. This movie is very charming and entertaining. The voice acting by well-known actors and actresses really brings the characters to life."

      "text": "\u201cShrek\u201d is an instant animated classic. Rudely sending up even the most beloved fairy tale traditions while at the same time effectively embodying them, this spirited and often very funny lark accomplishes something that most films in the bygone Hollywood studio era used to do but is remarkably rare in today\u2019s world of niche markets: It offers entertainment equally to viewers from 4 to 104.\r Playing equally effectively as a lively romp for kids and an enormously clever comedy for adults, \u201cShrek\u201d is both simple and sophisticated, hip without being smug or condescending. It\u2019s also a film for animation fans to cherish as well as one that non-enthusiasts can enjoy. On May 12, pic will become just the fifth animated film to be shown in competition at the Cannes Film Festival, after the late \u201940s-early \u201950s Disney features \u201cMake Mine Music,\u201d \u201cDumbo\u201d and \u201cPeter Pan,\u201d and the 1973 French production \u201cLa Planete Sauvage\u201d (Fantastic Planet).\r Shaking the narrative and stylistic cobwebs from the form, standing every fairy tale convention on its head and landing some excellent shots at Disney for good measure, the picture scores on every front: The writing is smart, the vocal performances are game, and the relatively lifelike look is stunningly realized, making for the best-looking computer animated feature to date.\r Screenplay by the team of Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (\u201cAladdin,\u201d \u201cThe Mark of Zorro\u201d), Joe Stillman (\u201cBeavis & Butt-head Do America\u201d) and Roger S.H. Schulman (\u201cBalto\u201d) is based on a short 1990 illustrated children\u2019s book by William Steig that chronicled in very simple terms a horrible ogre\u2019s journey to a castle where he wins the hand of an equally ugly princess. There was nothing more to it than that, so it\u2019s a conservative estimate to venture that at least 95% of the inspiration for what\u2019s onscreen came from the scriptwriters, who have let their imaginations go in coming up with characters, subplots, relationships, gags, intrigues and flights of fancy that have no seeds in the book.\r Fine jokes and reversals of expectations fill the journey homeward, where the film most clearly reveals its charming small debts to such timeless classics as \u201cDon Quixote,\u201d \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d and \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d among others. One of the funniest bits has Princess Fiona singing a Disney-style duet with a bluebird, until the chirping creature suddenly explodes when Fiona hits a piercing high note. Only false note in the entire picture comes when Fiona, accosted by a strangely French-accented \u201cMonsieur\u201d Robin Hood, makes some \u201cMatrix\u201d/\u201dCrouching Tiger\u201d-type martial arts moves; bit feels like a sop to tastes of the moment and is the element that will first appear to date the film in years to come.\r Visually, \u201cShrek\u201d is a constant dazzlement, the images all but leaping off the screen. Against the brilliantly designed, exceptionally vivid backgrounds, the characters, human and animal alike, appear realistic and highly expressive without being photographically so; the fine line between naturalism and stylization has been unerringly walked by the large team working under first-time directors Andrew Adamson (a veteran visual effects supervisor) and Vicky Jenson (an art director and storyboard artist).\r Endowing Shrek with a mild Irish brogue, Myers brings abundant drollery and vocal appeal to the physically repugnant title character, which implicitly lends weight to the underlying theme of beauty coming from the inside. Much as he did in his previous animated outing as Mushu the Dragon in \u201cMulan,\u201d Murphy provides Donkey with a jive-talking motor mouth; some of his riffs are genuinely amusing, but the routine threatens to become a bit much at times. Diaz\u2019s readings are energetic and willful, making Fiona a medieval \u201cCharlie\u2019s Angels\u201d candidate, and Lithgow makes the vertically shortchanged Farquaad imposing without undue melodrama.\r Outstanding score by Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell (\u201cAntz,\u201d \u201cChicken Run\u201d) is abetted by a collection of eclectic, shrewdly chosen pop tunes all used to lively effect."

Every single movie those two companies made were great and I loved every single one of them except Dreamworks's huge disappointments like \"Shark Tale\" and \"Bee Movie\" even though they weren't the worst movies ever made. By far, my favorite Dreamworks Animated movie is none other than \"Shrek\" loosely based on the book by William Steig. It tells the story about Shrek, a peace loving ogre who is desperate to save his swamp (along with help from a talkative donkey named, well, Donkey) that has been taken over by the fairy tale creatures sent by Lord Farquaad. He makes a deal that if Shrek rescues Princess Fiona, he'll give him his swamp back. I can't spoil the rest only to those who haven't seen it.Everything about this movie is magnificent. The story was very original due to Dreamworks's earlier entries. The characters were great/funny. Donkey was by far the most hilarious fairy tale character I have ever seen and Shrek had a couple of funny lines. The voice acting for the characters were absolutely perfect and they gave their successful talents for this movie. The computer animation is stunningly amazing with very rich colorful backgrounds and striking visuals. The pop culture jokes were very funny I loved every single one of them. The music from Harry Gregson Williams and John Powell was beautiful with some very emotional melodies including the song \"It Is You I Have Loved\" sung by Dana Glover was lovely.Shrek is Dreamworks Animation's strongest animated adventure comedy which was intended for its younger audiences and it is suitable for kids ages +8-12. A solid thumbs from me :)"

I love Mike Myers - but his \"if it's not scottish -it's crap\" voice over (which btw, they reprecorded after they decided they didn't like his regular vocals). And the Dr. Doolittle Eddie Murphy Donkey made me want to yak. It's as if someone in Marketing said: let's make a film that will appeal to all ages- it will be a mix of \"the Princess Bride\" and \"broadway's Into the Woods,\" but 3D ANIMATED. Then we'll make it hip by adding a few pop hits, and we'll get famous voices and make everyone tell sick jokes! Then we can call Burger King and have them make green slurpees and apple jelly dip! wow. It'll be great. And all you sick weirdos out there fell for it. This green piece won't be remembered for too long, take my word for it. Really, everybody thought the marky mark Planet of the Apes was great when it came out..and look what happened to that."

Deriving from a vast number of fairy tales, Shrek is an animation for the whole family, with its wit and satire that is both spellbinding and humorous. The characters have inimitable personalities, to their fairytale counterparts. Donkey played by Eddie Murphy is easily defined as the break out character, with his vivacious and gregarious attitude and his memorable lines. The only Dreamworks' movie that is superior to Beauty and the Beast and Pixar."

He is a loveable character and is someone alot of people (me included) can relate too. There are other characters here as well and all of them do a excellent job. The fact that this movie is based around classic fairy tale stories gives it such a nostalgic feeling but also puts enough of a fresh spin on it to make it new and unique. It hasn't got the sparkly sparkles that a Disney movie would have but that is what we are here to see! We are here to watch a ogre have a shower in the mud, but also go on a epic adventure and in doing so, find out there is more to life than just scaring people and that everyone, even ogres have layers...Like a onion."

The comedy is all jolly, wicked and brilliant, but the romance is also something to be treasured. Even though these are just animated characters, they are the most realistic people-like creatures. The romance story is amazingly subtle and is one of the best things about this movie. Kudos to Eddie Murphy, Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow too for voicing these full-bodied characters. Eddie is a hilarious fast-talker, Mike?s Scottish accent rarely slips, and Cameron?s true-love-obsessed Princess Fiona is a treat for her and John just seems to be a very talented voice. Of course I could not go through this review without mentioning the outstanding visual value in which this film beholds. The characters all look incredibly life-like, the sets are stunning, the cinematography is beautiful and the CGI-style will never fail. Hats off to the bunch of directors who deserve more praise than they get. Directors are often over-looked in animated films but the directors behind Shrek do marvelously and hopefully people will take more notice. But, at the end of the day, Shrek?s script is its top spot. The script is crude, hilarious, clever, poignant, energetic, inventive and romantic. Shrek is a pitch-perfect good time at the flicks. An animated masterpiece, one of the best of its kind."

If you have not seen this film yet check it out all the stuff I mentioned plus the humor make for enjoyable film that you will be glad you saw. There is a reason why this film spawned three sequels and a spin off. Shrek is one of Dreamworks\u2019 finest.\r Final Score: 75/100"
