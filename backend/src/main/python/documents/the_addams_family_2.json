      "text": "The sequel to THE ADDAMS FAMILY failed to pique my interest? Some of the film's scenes were entertaining, while others were strange? It's not something I'd recommend to anyone else! The film was so disjointed that it appeared as if the creative team was racing to the finish line. Every scene was sloppily cut; I was looking forward to seeing this film and had ignored all of the negative reviews, but I had to leave after the first 30 minutes. As a result of all of the confusing scenes, my head began to ache. The music was fantastic!. In my opinion, it isn't any \"better\" than the first. It isn't as interesting or entertaining as the first film. Wednesday was far too prevalent, with far too little of everything else. They try, but the majority of the humour is repetitive and lacks originality. It was all very bland and boring. Because of the voice cast and the characters that are well-known and popular, it's not even worth watching for those reasons alone. This franchise's prospects and future are completely meaningless. In terms of visual effects or the evolution of the animated film genre into a more artistic medium, The Addams Family 2 is not a ground-breaking animated comedy sequel by any means."
