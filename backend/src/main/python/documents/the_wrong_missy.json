Only problem I had with the movie, was the plot, the \"wrong Missy\" (Lauren Lapkus) was not likable from beginning, and since the real Mellisa \"right Missy\" (Molly Sims) was on screen, I loved her, and the movie just pushed you to \"like\" wrong Missy, but i just couldn't. Average Happy Medison movie."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "What do people expect with a Happy Maddison production, Funny slapstick comedy that's it!!!.I can honestly say the film is ok there's some laugh out loud moments but you can tell these guys are not wanting oscars, they are all friends and love to have a laugh.Definitely worth a watch to have a chuckle over complete stupidness that does not take itself  seriously."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I know movies are obviously very subjective. That being said, my wife and I absolutely LOVED this movie and laughed our asses off from beginning to end. Missy's character was so over the top and funny and just made the movie. Our all-time favorite movie is and always will be Step Brothers but The Wrong Missy has easily clinched our number two spot. I highly recommend watching. If you're not laughing hysterically in the first 15 minutes, turn it off because this movie is clearly not for you. However, if you are laughing hysterically, enjoy...because it won't let up until the end."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "The lack of effort is insulting but this **** gets produced because it's what people consume in Netflix and unfortunately I'm part of that statistics because I watched it there.I would be ashamed to be David Spade and know that I only get jobs because I'm friends with the producer"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "This film reminded me a lot of Adam Sandler's Jack and Jill as it tries way too hard to be funny and relatable and it just results in a boring movie with an overly annoying main character."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This movie is now my new favourite comedy!

Can we please stop trying to make David Spade happen? The dude is awful and has been awful pretty much his entire career and the main character playing Missy was so overbearing and over-the-top that I wanted to push her off the 50th floor of a high rise building. Avoid this movie at all costs if you have a brain in your head as it's clearly made for the lowest common denominators."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "was not expecting a good movie....wow was I Happily surprise, funny, physical comedy... be sure to watch it...adult humor...so not with the children... highly recommended."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Rarely do you want to strangle the female lead in a movie unless she is the villain. Not so with \u201cThe Wrong Missy.\u201d The \u201cwrong\u201d Missy (Lauren Lapkus) is so egregiously, teeth-grating, head-bangingly annoying that you\u2019re ready to kill yourself or her within the first 20 minutes. She gets better, but not much.  At least David Spade, Vanilla Ice, and Rob Schneider were temporarily saved from the Hollywood \u201cwhatever happened to\u2026?\u201d dustbin with this project, but for how long? OK to see when: stoned, drunk, on heavy pain meds, hungry for low comedy, or just bored out of your mind and churlish about \u201cTiger King\u201d being over."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "My wife and I were looking for something to get our minds off the current COVID crisis.

It is awful, there is one scene where \"The Wrong Missy\" full on sexually assaults Tim (David Spades Character)and it's fine. I'm not offended by it, it's just not funny its just gross. Lauren Lapkus's Missy is so super predatory it goes beyond playing for laughs and just becomes uncomfortable.I don't know why David Spade is wearing a bad wig and I have no idea why any woman would want to pay attention to someone as dull and as 2 dimensional as his character in this POS. I wasn't expecting much from this film going in, I just wanted to watch something goofy after a bad day at work, but this was bad, badly written, badly directed, badly acted.Please for the love of god!!! Save yourselves and don't want this film!!!!!"}], "recommendations": ["good_luck_chuck", "the_hangover", "the_watch", "dinner_for_schmucks", "30_minutes_or_less", "grown_ups", "trainwreck", "the_change_up", "this_is_the_end", "the_ridiculous_6", "what_happens_in_vegas", "tammy", "rough_night", "miss_march", "jexi", "ted_2", "couples_retreat", "jackass_presents_bad_grandpa", "ted", "thunder_force", "dirty_grandpa", "hot_tub_time_machine", "dumb_and_dumber_to", "superbad", "hubie_halloween"]}
