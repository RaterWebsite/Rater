Ethan Hawk was also good. Very emotional and realistic. The low budget did not hurt the movie at all in my opinion. Recommended!"

This gem of a film not only paints a very intelligent picture of our near future, but also succeeds in telling a truly beautiful story.

Andrew Niccol has crafted a truly beautiful, intelligent and poetic film, accompanied by Michael Nyman's stunning score, it just gets better and better with age. Thurman, Hawke and Law are painfully beautiful and al together wonderfully compelling. Part sci-fi, murder mystery and film noir carefully rolled into one, at it's core lies a simple story about the redemptive power of love. Practically ignored by critics, cinema goers and film buffs upon it's release, one day it may receive the respect and adoration it deserves."

      "text": "One of the finest science fiction films to ever hit the screen. It is most certainly in my top five. I think \"Noop\" needs to watch this again. \"No essence.\" What are you on about?. Of course the essence was there and it was in the quite insipid form of discrimination based on a humans DNA which has already started to some degree and in the film relegates those without perfect DNA to the scrap heap and dead end jobs. It is not to hard to imagine the losses to human civilization if such discrimination had existed a hundred or so years ago. For example, Albert Einstein would have been on the scrap heap. Makes you think doesn't it. An excellent script with superb performances by the cast, particularly Jude Law. Again I find myself wishing I could push the scorer further to the right. 10 out of 10 does not give justice to this superb film."

It championed the ideals of perseverance, discipline, and overcoming societally-imposed limitations. It dealt heavily with identity, and the repercussions of eugenics screening, genetic discrimination, and transhumanism. With a talented cast, well-written dialogue, and a moving score, Gattaca is an inspiring and touching film that everybody should see at least once."

      "text": "This is a really good science fiction film. Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Jude Law, and Alan Arkin, turn in great performances here and you can really feel the emotion in their performances. The score is also brilliant and the thrills/intrigue are provided quite capably by this one. In addition, the sets are effects are really well done. However, where this one truly excels is in its message. A warning about eugenics, Gattaca is not really a science fiction film or a thriller. Rather, it is an inspirational film as it shows that no matter what people think, you can achieve your dreams if you work hard enough to do so, even if there are things that could/will hold you back. In terms of the science fiction, the futuristic elements and technologies are all really well done and developed, plus all are very interesting ideas that may seem implausible now, but could be fact in just a matter of time. The thriller element was also interesting, but since I do not want to spoil too much, I will not mention what I like about it, but it keeps you on edge as you try to see if the cops will figure everything out or not. Overall, Gattaca is a smart, thrilling film that grabs a hold of you early on and does not let go until the film is over."

An incredibly human look at prejudice and how hard it is to get ahead in life when you are given the short end of the stick in society for something completely out of your control.An all-star cast lead by Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, and Jude Law will leave you spellbound. Seriously, these three actors are bringing their A-game with their performances. This movie holds up and has aged extremely well. Sci-fi fans cannot miss Gattaca!"
