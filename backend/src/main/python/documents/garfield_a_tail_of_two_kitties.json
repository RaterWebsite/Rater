      "text": "I recently watched it on TV, right after the first. Not as sophomoric as the first one, nor as campy, but still lacks what makes the comics funny: a brain. The parody is long dated, and lacks any satire that the comics possess. The acting is retarded at best. Especially Jennifer Love Hewitt. The romance is supposed to be tumultuous and funny. Instead it makes me want to s**t and vomit at the same time."
