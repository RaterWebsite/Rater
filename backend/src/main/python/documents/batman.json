The T Shirt with the BAT symbol...the Prince soundtrack...the endless merchandise.  How about the movie itself? It always was an unconventional film, from its choice of male cast (comedian Michael Keaton) to its Blade Runner influenced Art Design.Yes.. the narrative took strange turns, the fighting scene looked really stiff. But the spectacle is still present, two decades after its release. While the Nolan trilogy brought the Dark Knight to the 21st century, Tim Burton's version was the first super hero film that showed the true potential of the genre. Not the best, but still pretty great stuff."

      "text": "This was the first big budget Hollywood production of a live-action Batman movie not including the serial from the 1940\u2019s or the campy movie from the 1960\u2019s starring Adam West. It is presented as a darker story than the original comic series, as the Batman comics were starting to explore more mature themes in the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s with graphic novels such as The Killling Joke and The Dark Knight Returns. The film is set in the fictional Gotham city, which is constructed using visual effects for the film. The city is a cool setting, with gothic architecture and towering skyscrapers and bustling city life with traffic, hookers and panhandlers. There is a good tone-setting scene at the start of movie where Batman confronts a couple of thugs who mug a family in a sketchy part of town. At the start of the movie, Batman is a mysterious vigilante who little is known about and kind of seen as a urban legend. He hasn\u2019t started his relationship with Commissioner Gordon yet. Beautiful blonde photographer meets billionaire playboy and philanthropist owner of Wayne Enterprises Bruce Wayne at a party at Bruce\u2019s mansion and tells him she is trying to get pictures of Batman for the Gotham Times. She and Bruce start dating and sleep together, little does she know that he is the caped crusader himself. Meanwhile, mobster Jack Napier, a wise-cracking goon who is having an affair with Mafia Boss Grissom\u2019s young mistress is set up to break into Axis Chemicals, a factory that has ties to the mob, just to be confronted by dirty cop Lieutenant Eckart and his police squad, based on Harvey Bullock from the comics. Napier kills Eckart and almost manages to escape, but is apprehended by Batman who ends up making him fall into a vat of chemicals or acid although he tries to save Napier. Napier survives this and is left at a cheap emergency clinic where the doctor does surgery on him to get rid of the damage done by the chemicals. The procedure was done so poorly that it result in Jack Napier having something that looks like a permanent grin on his face. Also, now Jack\u2019s hair is green, his lips are ruby red, and his skin is bleached white. He looks like a clown. In despair after he sees his reflection, Napier begins to laugh maniacally in a chilling scene at the clinic and leaves to cause mayhem. He starts calling himself the Joker, kills Boss Grissom, and takes over the mob. Joker utilizes weaponized clown props such as an electrocuting joy buzzer, an acid spraying flower, a spring-loaded boxing glove, and guns that he can stretch into hand-canons which also sometimes just eject a flag that says \u201cbang.\u201d The rest of the movie is pretty much just the Joker causing mayhem and Batman preventing it. Vicki Vale learns that Bruce Wayne is Batman by the end of the movie and she chooses to stay with him. Batman also learns that Jack Napier was the true killer of his parents when he was a child ( as opposed to Joe Chill like in the comics) and makes the connection to the Joker. He stops the Joker from attempting to gas the city streets with Smilex gas, which causes people to start laughing uncontrollably and die laughing and then kills the Joker. I liked the movie\u2019s depictions of Bruce Wayne and his alter ego Batman, Joker, Alfred, and Vicki Vale. It was good how they actually established that the Joker was proficient in chemistry as he is in the comics, and the Joker was funny in the movie often making quips and saying punchlines. The Joker\u2019s origin was similar to his origin in the comics as the Red Hood, although the film took some liberties in making him a mobster named \u201cJack Napier.\u201d Sometimes in the comics, when Joker\u2019s real name from his past is alluded to it is \u201cJack.\u201d Michael Keaton\u2019s performance as Batman is probably my favorite out of all the Batmen I have seen in the movies, as he doesn\u2019t go too over the top but still manages to seem imposing. A classic, this might be my favorite Batman movie other than maybe The Dark Knight from 2008 which incidentally also stars the Joker."

      "text": "Nostalgia can be a very powerful thing.  I admit that.  This was the first VHS I ever owned as a child, and I remember it very fondly, even the preceding Warner Brothers ad starring Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck.  I have re-watched Tim Burton's 1989 adaptation of Batman several times, and even after re-evaluating the film as an adult, I still believe it to be the best Batman film to date.  I was too young to comprehend or care about the controversy surrounding the casting of Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne, or Nicholson working out a deal regarding the movie's profits.  I didn't care about any of that.  And honestly, I still don't.  This is simply one of my favorite comic book movies of all time that I rarely tire of watching.  The tone is dark and brooding, which is a far cry from the campy Batman television show/movie that came before it, starring Adam West. The story is quite grim, and Gotham City is a bleak, crime-infested place that is visually accentuated with hues of black and grey, a lot of grey. Nicholson and Keaton play their parts very well, with Nicholson being the stand out as Joker. The supporting cast is also stellar, particularly Kim Basigner, as the determined photojournalist who is investigating Batman.  The plot is straightforward, and the pace is good, if somewhat slow.  But the action scenes are amazing, and are all accentuated with Danny Elfman's brilliant score, which sets the mood perfectly throughout the film.  Director Tim Burton did an extraordinary job with this movie, and as terrific as his sequel Batman Returns is, Tim Burton's first attempt at Batman was his best.  There's not much to dislike here. Even though Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy was better received critically and by fans, I never cared for it that much. For me, Batman 1989 is the only Batman movie I'll ever need."

      "text": "Tim Burton's BATMAN was made in 1989 by Tim Burton obviously and stars Jack Nicholson, Kim Basinger, Jack Palance and Michael Keaton..... Jack Palance in Batman looks the same as he does in Tango & Cash and his performance is quite similar and he's not a great actor but his character in the movie worked... Batman for a 1989 film is cleverly directed and made and some of the film is pretty dark, some of the villains are laughable like Joker's troops because they seem a bit sloppy and not up to standards, as far as Jack Nicholson's role as the Joker was concerned he did a great job and certainly the best movie villain ever... Batman is full of great stunts, chases, shootings, fights, explosions and twists and turns that keep the viewer entertained from start to finish. The acting overall is pretty good and some scenes are hilarious like Bob the goon who works for the Joker because he gets asked by the Joker for his gun then the Joker kills him so some of the Joker's men are a bit dumb bit still a classic and a masterpiece of film making by Tim Burton... The action scenes are excellent and the story is okay so I've no negatives really to say about the movie because it's near perfect for me. The best Batman film ever made and that will never change."

      "text": "'Batman' is a movie that's seen many times, and while it certainly is a classic, it does have its flaws, mostly in the central characters.\r The movie stars Jack Nicholson as the Joker, and Michael Keaton as the title character. Yes, it is in that order as well. Directed by Tim Burton, the movie has his own unique style with colorful characters and a darker, gloomy tone to avoid the camp-style of the Adam West \"Batman\" from the 1960s.\r The plot revolves around Batman trying to catch the Joker from injecting Gotham city with crime, and exposing the citizens to some Smile gas which incidentally transforms the people into what the Joker has become. The Joker became the crazy maniac that he is after he fell into a pool of acid which disfigures his face to form a permanent grin. Nicholson gives a great performance as the crazy Joker, but having seen the movie recently, it almost seems as if he might be over-acting his role. The loud, maniac laughs and the over-the-top delivery of some of his lines can seem a little problematic.\r But this is in no way Nicholson's fault, like I said, he did a fantastic job in the role... Director Tim Burton has been known for animating his characters on screen. Not just with the pale face make-up, but possibly how he tells his actors to deliver their lines. A huge part of the Joker's performance is obviously influenced by Tim Burton's vision.\r Michael Keaton is great as Bruce Wayne/Batman, but we don't delve that deep into his character. It has been said many times by other critics that this is Jack Nicholson's movie, and not Keaton's. This is true, we get more of a Joker origin story rather than the title character. This may be due to the fact that the screenplay, written by Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren were so focused heavily on creating such an iconic villain, that they got lost in translation and forgot who the movie was for in the first place.\r Other than this, 'Batman' is a visual treat, a thrilling adaptation of the Caped Crusader of Gotham city, it does feel a little jarring that we get a glimpse of Bruce's childhood/origin story almost half way through the movie, but, when you have fun with what Burton presents you with, it's hard to stay mad.\r Overall, if you want a good Batman movie, this will deliver what you might want. The actors' performances outshine the overall story."

Why was it the Joker who killed Bruce's parents? These twists were very extra.

Jack as the Joker is deliciously evil (could have done without the Prince music though) and Keaton captures the psychological pain of Bruce/Batman. I gave this the same rating I gave to Batman Begins because both EXCEL with strong performances and the serious atmosphere of Gotham. However, it looks increasingly that The Dark Knight will surpass both with an even better cast and a truly menacing-looking Joker (played by Heath Ledger). May Nolan continue to build on the seriousness and quality of, not only Batman Begins, but also Burton's (while maintaining his own style)."

      "text": "The most successful outing of the Caped Crusader before the 2007 smash hit Dark Knight, the 1989 Tim Burton version offers a straight up comic book movie with a crap load of action, explosions and overall mayhem. Michael Keaton stars as Bruce Wayne, a sly and unassuming businessman who by day deals with documents and contracts and who by night is a one man army, stopping crimes all over Gotham City. He forms a relationship with photojournalist Vicki Vale, played sexily by Kim Basinger, who wants to write a story about the Batman legend and crack the truth once and for all. Meanwhile, a citywide spree of madness and murder is being perpetrated by The Joker, played excellently by Jack Nicholson who is perfect for the role. Quite simply, when it comes to portraying crazy people, he is THE best. As mentioned before, the movie was in the hands of extraordinary artist Tim Burton, four years after his big screen debut with the 1985 comedy Pee-Wee's Big Adventure. The movie looks great, and the DVD quality is top-notch for a movie that is nearly 25 years old. I have to say, this movie in particular is the best looking action movie I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. However, the film does have some flaws, my biggest complaint being a sometimes cheesy soundtrack (Prince). In sum, a truly great film experience that all fans of the genre should check it out."

This comes from a time when comic book movies were not that common and if they did exist they weren\u2019t taken as seriously as they are today. The fact that a dark comic book movie came out that was good was a big deal and the film did lay the groundwork for future comicbook movies and later versions of the character that I love specifically Batman: The Animated Series as well as the Nolan films. What makes this film entertaining are the characters primarily the Joker with Jack Nicholson giving an excellent performance. If this is your introduction to Batman you\u2019ll probably love this movie but if not you won\u2019t be blown away by it but it is still entertaining.

I just finished watching the scene where Bruce Wayne confronts the joker in Vicki Vale's apartment. Oh yeah, you fanboys know what I'm talking about and every one of you knows when you saw that scene even your reaction was, \"And Bruce Wayne did that because....?\".

      "text": "Batman is a truly fine superhero film. It's not just that, though - most of the film more closely resembles an action-orientated film noir, and it has a finale that appears to have been taken straight out of a Gothic horror movie. Michael Keaton is the best film Batman, no question. While I can understand his casting raised a few eyebrows, but his portrayal of Bruce Wayne is very human and sincere, and very likeable, and his portrayal of the Dark Knight is unexpectedly effective, and highly influential (Christian Bale wasn't the first to adopt a different voice for the bat and the man).  His successors never reach the heights Keaton does, with Val Kilmer being too camp and George Clooney being completely lifeless. Jack Nicholson's Joker makes for an extremely entertaining, scary villain. While he will now always be compared to Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance, you can't avoid the fact that they're very different roles. Ledger's Joker is uncontrollable and without any clear aim - he's a rabid dog. Nicholson's Joker is a sociopathic gangster with fame on his mind, is far more calculated and aware of what he is doing, and I personally find that far more scary. Like I say, they're different interpretations of the character, and impossible to rank one above the other. Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale makes a good damsel in distress, Michael Gough makes the perfect Alfred, and Jack Palance growls through his lines as another despicable villain, crime boss Carl Grissom. It's such a shame that Billy Dee Williams never got to play Two-Face (as he really wanted to) with his version of Harvey Dent being such an intriguing, ambiguous, image-obsessed character - he would have made a really memorable villain. Like all of Tim Burton's films, Batman is a visual feast, with Gotham city presented as a murky, industrial, crime-ridden dystopian metropolis, but with a striking ahistorical mix of architecture by designer Anton Furst. Appropriately enough for a film which is so influenced by Brazil in its design, the cinematographer is regular Terry Gilliam collaborator Roger Pratt, and his steady, measured filming style marries very well with Burton's dark, focused vision. As well as being a very engaging and well constructed superhero film and crime thriller, Batman has a surprising amount of comedy in it. This isn't the campy, pun-laden humour of the Schumacher Batman films - these are clever, self-aware jokes about social convention (the scene where Bruce Wayne is having a meal with Vicky Vale across a ridiculously long dining table before Wayne admits that he doesn't think he's ever been in this particular room of his vast mansion before is incredibly funny, helped no small measure by Keaton's impeccable comic timing) and the affectionate mockery of the ridiculousness of the source material (two thugs looking over an apparently unconscious Batman wonder who he is, but rather than immediately thinking to remove his mask, one suggests that they should \"check his wallet\"). The addition of humour adds a lot to the film, but never at the expense of story or character. Schumacher took this too far in his films, but Burton gets the balance between humour and seriousness just right. Finally, Danny Elfman's score is among the best of his career, providing a consistent moody and mysterious tone to the film, and creating a memorable hero theme to rival even John Williams' iconic theme for Superman. Batman is a truly great superhero film. So visually striking, it looks like it was torn straight out of the comic books it was based on, and the two most recognisable characters from those pages are brought wonderfully to life by Keaton and Nicholson. The film retains the tragedy and darkness of Batman as a character and the world he inhabits, but never gets carried away with it to the extent that the film becomes depressing. The addition of a liberal dose of humour is a welcome one, and it's nice to see a decent big budget superhero film confident enough to incorporate comedy into its story (something we have seen more of recently, with Iron Man and Thor). A great superhero film, a nice call-back to film noir and Gothic horror of classic Hollywood, and one of Mr Burton's very best - Batman really is rather fantastic."
