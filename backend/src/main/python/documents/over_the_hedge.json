That being said, I watched the movie with a bunch of my friends (resonably intelligent college freshmen), and we all found it hilarious. There is a manic energy throughout the whole thing, and while there is the obligatory slow down to talk about \"family\", even that scene has a sharp gag. There is a streak of dark irony in the movie as RJ explains suburban life and consumerism in such a way that it seems absurd, but he paints it to be glorious. I don't think young kids will get that, but it certainly stays true to the comic strips wry commentary on entitled animals."

      "text": "Not bad, but just 'OK' overall. For me, this animated film failed to live up to expectations in 2 areas. First, it was lacking comedic voice talent in the lead roles. Willis and Shandling were OK, but they don't impart even a fraction of the comedic voice talent of someone like Eddie Murphy or Steve Carell. Carell was hands down the best voice talent in this film, though I think everyone else did a great job as well. By comparison, Vern and RJ cam across as rather deadpan, and they both left me bored much of the time. Their characters were too conflicted as well, and they just couldn't bring the laughs with the seriousness written into their roles. The producers could have done far better to give Hammy (Carell) the lead role, leaving RJ (Willis) and Vern (Shandling) as supporting roles. Moving on to the 2nd area that was lacking, the writing in this film was not so hot. The storyline was anemic, it lacked engaging concepts, and most of all it lacked enough laughs. The human characters in the film lacked any comedic value whatsoever, and they were WAY overdone. All in all, I think this film needed more lighthearted comedy, and less seriousness about the themse of family and consumption. Hammy was easily the best part of the film. \"But I like the cookie...\""

It helps that the movie was also genuinely funny."

      "text": "The recent mini-grass roots movement by certain church groups to block The Da Vinci Code's ascent to its inevitable #1 box office position on its opening weekend by having members buy blocks of tickets to this, its only major competitor making its debut, was clearly doomed from the start. But even though such actions (though clearly preferable to picketing the multiplex and therefore calling even MORE attention to Ron Howard's leaden adaptation) are exercises in total futility, I STILL wish (strictly from a standpoint of esthetics and entertainment value) that I'd contributed to the cause by purchasing TWENTY tickets to watch the cute little woodland creatures encountering, enjoying and battling suburbia. This animated treat is a near-perfect mixture of adorable and engaging characters, silly but funny first grade humor and subtle, sophisticated adult satire, and it almost completely avoids ALL the indulgences that made DreamWorks' Shrek movies a tad overrated, and its Shark Tale and Madagascar well-nigh unwatchable: its pop-culture references are limited to a relative few; they're not slammed in your face with Soupy Sales pie-throwing velocity but are artfully presented (if you get the Mission: Impossible allusion, fine...but if not you'll still enjoy the context) ; they're all, as they used to say about onscreen nudity, relevant to the plot...and, most importantly, they work! (Would you believe that--wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles, this film features a Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon joke that's genuinely inventive, original and clever?) More often, Over the Hedge gets its humor from wonderfully observed aspects of human (and animal) nature: I'm not sure it's possible for anyone who's worked in an office, gone to school or just hung around an airport, bus terminal or other public place to NOT enjoy the brilliant opening sequence...and be sure you stay in the theater till the VERY end to watch it grow an even better payoff! The voice casting, which in many recent CGI features seems to boil down to little more than signing up whoever's currently available and has a moderate-to-high \"Q\" rating, couldn't have been more on-target here, with special favorites being Wanda Sykes as a skunk with even more attitude than you'd expect, Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as a pair of extremely Canadian porcupines, and William Shatner, who as a totally over-the-top fox with a real fondness for rolling over and playing dead, delightfully continues to embrace his late-career recognition of his inner William Shatner-ness. Special kudos goes to Steve Carell as the uber-ultra-maxi-hyperactive Hammy the Squirrel, a role that could've been truly annoying and unbearable, but in Carell's hands and vocal cords is irresistably sweet and hilarious...which is entirely appropriate, because the last theatrical movie I laughed this loud, long and often at was Carell's own The 40-Year-Old Virgin last September. (This doesn't mean that I'm suggesting that you wait for Over the Hedge to hit DVD, then invite the neighborhood kids over for a double feature!) It can maybe legitimately be argued that the movie's three villains--a grizzly bear, an exterminator and, creepiest of all, a scary homeowners' association poobah--get a bit more punishment than they actually deserve, especially since two of them have a legitimate beef against our heroes. But that's nitpicking: throughout all of its not-long-enough 80 minutes, Over the Hedge proves to be the non-Pixar CGI animated feature that's as close to Pixar as a non-Pixar can get...and that's more than good enough!"

Shame that the studio that brought us Shrek can\u2019t create something on that level again. Thankfully though the film is not all bad. Some of the characters get some laughs and the heist feeling of the movie is cool. Unlike Madagascar the film isn\u2019t too bogged down in arguing and does have some more fun and creativity particularly towards the end. This film is not for everyone and a lot of the issues mentioned here are going to bother some people. While these issues do bother me and hurt the film I still had fun with it particualry in the last third and am glad I saw it. If you are familiar with Dreamworks style you can figure out quickly if this is your movie. For me it wasn\u2019t good but it was still enjoyable"
