  "description": "In the late 1950s and early '60s, artist Walter Keane achieves unbelievable fame and success with portraits of saucer-eyed waifs. However, no one realizes that his wife, Margaret, is the real painter behind the brush. Although Margaret is horrified to learn that Walter is passing off her work as his own, she is too meek to protest too loudly. It isn't until the Keanes' marriage comes to an end and a lawsuit follows that the truth finally comes to light.",

      "text": "\"Big Eyes\" is a biopic starring Amy Adams (as kitsch artist Margaret Keane) and Christoph Waltz (as her husband Walter Keane) and the story of his attempt to pass off his wife's artwork as his own. The film was written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski  and directed by Tim Burton.\r Much like any film attempting to tell the true story of its subjects, life is not always as dramatic and interesting as a fiction writer and/or viewer would prefer and this movie is no exception. More like a short story made into a feature length film, the movie holds our interest primarily because it relates events that actually happened and with which most viewers will either identify or remember. Beyond that, the film is light and certainly not worthy of the accolades heaped upon it by so many critics. Mr. Waltz tends to overact and Ms. Adams, although trying very hard, appears uncomfortable in playing this heavy dramatic role. I give the film a 7 reminding the viewer that although fact may be stranger than fiction, it isn't always more entertaining."

I had high expectations for her performance and she certainly lived up to them. She was awesome. The soundtrack here, highlighted by the Lana Del Rey track, is also great. The song \"Big Eyes\" was used perfectly in the film and truly communicated the feelings Margaret Keane was feeling at the moment. On top of that, the script and plot were awesome, plus they were told very well through Tim Burton's direction. I do not love Burton, but he was great here in telling the story. On that note, the plot was very interesting. Very interesting story and enjoyable to watch unfold. Art is not something that really interests me, but when put on screen in this fashion, it was riveting. I also loved the cinematography. I do not know if I was seeing things, but there seemed to be some effect put on Adams' eyes reminiscent of the eyes in her paintings, which I thought was really cool.\r On the negative, some plot elements felt...extra. Namely Krysten Ritter's entire character (her acting was also sub-par). I typically love Christoph Waltz and Jason Schwartzman, but neither were amazing here. They were solid and, in particular Waltz, had moments of sheer brilliance, but felt comically over the top at times, which really messed with the tone of the film. Finally, the film has a really contained feel to it. Biographical films can feel this way sometimes and this one certainly does. It felt very small and as if it was just trying to hit certain marks, which is something I never really enjoy.\r As a whole, Big Eyes is a good, enjoyable film with a fantastic performance from Amy Adams and good direction from Tim Burton that both combine to make this one well worth your time."

      "text": "Tim Burton looks like he's going back to his roots of what made his films great from the first place. That's nice news I like to hear.\r Big Eyes tells the story of a painter \"Margaret Keane\" flourished in the 1950s, as her paintings featuring children with large eyes became the rage. In the 1960s, her husband Walter Keane started taking credit for her work, leading to a long, difficult legal battle.\r Tim Burton back in his glory days was the best. Releasing movies that turn out amazing or great, but something happened with Burton when he started directing remakes of classic movies or old TV shows. Yeah Tim made so pretty crappy movies in the 2000's such as: Plant of the Apes (2001), Charlie and the Chocolate factory, Alice in Wonderland and Dark shadows. At one point I was losing hope for him as the great director that he was is soon gone, until a film called Frankenweenie came out in 2012 that I actually liked and give me more hope for Burton. And now I sawed Big Eyes and yeah Burton still got it, because this movie is pretty damn good.\r Amy Adams pulls off once again a fantastic performance in this movie. She brought such a powerful weight and a heart hitting performance to her character that's actually base on Margaret Keane that you has a viewer knows how she feels as her dream has been taken away from her. Shes such a brilliant actress that it's kind of sickening that she hasn't won a Oscar yet, I mean come on.\r Christoph Waltz in this movie was good but I think at times he dose come off over the top, a bit cartoony and not on this earth human been who would act like this person. But I can't conform that yet, because Margaret Keane is still alive today and maybe she described him like that and Waltz got him spot on, but I still can't conform that yet. But anywhere Waltz has I said was good but I bit cartoony.\r Tim Burton directing a movie with no white face paint, No Johnny Depp or his wife Helena Bonham Carter, a simple movie with so beautiful shot scenes that the good all Tim Burton use to do in his golden days....yep Burton's back everyone and he shows that he still can do drama and he still dose. Now would I put this up there with ED wood or Big Fish? no but it's good to see Burton still got it after years of directing and in this he did pretty good.\r For problems: The start of this movie didn't really suck me in with it's story and character's, it's until later on it finally did. The movie did drag at times and has I said before about Waltz being a bit cartoony at times.\r Overall Big Eyes was a lot of fun to watch. Amy Adams dose a brilliant job in this film and this is a solid Tim Burton film."

      "text": "Big Eyes has set a negative note for everyone involved except Amy Adams, who's the only one who seems to think this is a valuable film. Tim Burton has long lost the charm of his earliest pictures, turning what could have been a great drama in a jolly caricature, complete with cartoonesque narration, silly music and over-the top acting (Christoph Waltz). Speaking of Waltz, his performance is not completely bad, but it's miles away from the ones that got him two Oscars - while still retaining the comical aspect.\r Seriously, this movie could have been a much deeper insight on 50s culture, art culture, gender roles, everything; and instead it was forced into a senseless, cold comedy that loses power after minutes. Amy Adams is the one who keeps it together.\r Generally unimpressive. I blame Burton and Danny Elfman (a combination that rocked some twenty years ago); one for losing his wit and his talent, the other for... well, what the hell was that score? Straight out of a bag of old tricks. No. I had hoped for more."

Waltz has shown that he is an excellent actor and while Walter was charismatic, a \u2018salesman\u2019, a manipulator but most of all a liar who invented himself, obviously, the director, Tim Burton, gives him too much freedom, especially in the trial scene. Though he is suppose to be obnoxious, possibly to make Margaret more understandable, he crosses the line.\r Aside from the question of who did the art, and the bigger question of what is art, the reasons Margaret left her first husband, being strong enough to leave and take their daughter, why she stayed with Walter, letting him take away her accomplish- ment as an artist, as well as all her self-esteem, until two Jehovah Witnesses knock on her door, is not gone into deep enough by the screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski.\r A segment takes place in the building and opening of the World\u2019s Fair in 1964 where I worked in the Gas Pavilion as a waiter and I don\u2019t recall any of what was suppose to have happened there but then except being aware of the \u2018Big Eyes\u2019 paintings I wasn\u2019t aware of Margaret Keane\u2019s story.\r Amy Adams, playing a quiet, single mother of the 50s who doesn\u2019t find acceptance due to the social mores of the time, does a good job and comes into her own with her eyes and facial experiences during the trial scene. Delaney Raye as her young daughter Jane, and Madeleine Arthur as Jane in her teenage years, don\u2019t add anything to the film. Jon Polito, as the owner of the Hungry I, and Terence Stamp as the New York Times art critic John Canaday are standouts.\r The story of  Margaret Keane, her art, the times she lived through and why she was the way she was, and who she became, deserve a much stronger film then \u201cBig Eye"

      "text": "This movie felt like a long series of missed opportunities.  Both Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz came off as ultimately flat, making it that more frustrating that a cast of supporting characters were kept in the background rather than used to flesh out the story.   The movie often seemed more concerned with producing a shiny, gorgeous version of the 1950s and 1960s than it did with developing either the plot or the characters.  Christoph Waltz isn't quite believable as the charming sociopath, because his charm is too manic from the beginning--I wanted him to be a more talented liar early on, so that his unravelling could be more satisfying.  Similarly Amy Adams' misery and submission aren't entirely convincing either, and the hallucinations so prominently advertised in the trailer had a minimal role in the movie, and lacked an accompanying narrative of mental illness to explain or justify them.  The movie was still somewhat enjoyable overall, but it felt too glossy and superficial to be a compelling portrait of the Keanes."

But there are several key moments when you want so much for Adams's character to reveal the truth about her artwork -- which would have been great for her sanity and perhaps even workable if done early in their marriage. She doesn't, of course, and where the film falls short is helping us to understand why."

      "text": "In the early 60s, Keane paintings of pitiful waifs were all the rage. Turns out that Margaret (Amy Adams) painted them, but her charismatic husband (Christoph Waltz) took the credit. He also revolutionized the commercialization of popular art. Their first happy, then tumultuous marriage takes a repetitive long time to get to the courtroom showdown, which also goes on too long. Adams turns this halting, insecure character into a nuanced and compelling performance. Director Tim Burton minimized the bizarre flourishes expected from his work, to tell a straightforward narrative. While it's a fascinating story and Adams is worth the ticket, the film feels more like an informative historical replay, than a moving personal drama. NOTE: Look for the real Margaret in a conspicious cameo on a park bench behind Adam's easel in an early scene."

Then a second thought strikes me that maybe Walter is capable of simulating Margaret\u2019s trademark style, which could elongate this lawsuit case into a more complicated protracted battle. Well, the truth is, I was thinking too much, during the court sequences, after a long-standing filibuster from Walter, which presumably should be funny but only feels insufferable, finally the judge orders them to paint, but as audience has already been informed that Walter simply cannot paint, that is all, case closed, Margaret\u2019s win is such a duck soup, what a stroke of bathos!\r keep reading my review on my blog, please google: cinema omnivore, thanks"

The horror or conflict is easy, fun and childlike. And that's the problem with BIG EYES. This most intriguing story of the Keane's and their big eye paintings invites exploration into gender politics, sexism, pop culture v. high art, and the very nature of art itself. I wish the film failed for seeking to explore too many areas, instead Burton and his screenwriters are only interested in rubbing the surface of the Keane's personal story and the filmmakers depict this world with little threat or real consequence. That's why it comes as such as a shock in the final moments when Margaret Keane testifies to being manipulated and threatened. When was there any real threat? Why is her duplicity never explored with any depth? Amy Adams has the chops to deliver what is needed but instead, Burton focuses relentlessly on the shenanigans of Walter Keane. In many ways, Burton and his two male screenwriters are guilty of doing to Margaret's story exactly what Walter did to Margaret in real life. The film is entertaining, but ultimately, nothing more than a diversion when depth and insight were there for the exploring."

That's a shame because she at least deserved that much as she shows amazing range in this film morphing from meek pushover, to scared and abused, and finally to strong and independent ... which was highly frowned upon in the era that the film takes place in. Christoph Waltz was uneven, but when he was on he was also great. The supporting cast excels as well with standout performances from Terence Stamp, Danny Huston, Krysten Ritter, and Jason Schwartzman. At times powerful and poignant, Big Eyes is an entertaining tale overall.\r The Bad: What prevents the film from truly being great is the film's oddly placed comedic moments. At times, the film almost becomes a full blown comedy, which was an odd decision and felt out of place. Christoph Waltz's Walter Keane was presented as an especially comedic and slapstickish character at times which was a waste of his talent.

It seemed like the creators didn't willingly supervised to tell the story which is clearly visible in each frame as there is zero passion and enthusiasm on screen in any single aspect. The adaptation isn't as smart as the writers think and addition to that it is a bit chalky around the edges, even though it has its few moments that gives hope to the viewers. Tim Burton whose love for cinema is usually visible, is the missing puzzle and the reason why he fails to execute the anticipated vision on screen. On performance objective too, there appears to be a weakness which comes as a shock considering the potential of the cast like Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz. The feature is shot beautifully and is immensely pleasing on visual aesthetics but unfortunately all of it fades away quickly. Big Eyes is a narrow and blurred sight that is not aware of the vision and the trajectory that it wishes to follow and is the only reason why it never connects with the viewers."

      "text": "Strong performances make this movie, which is a straightforward, predictable, but easy-to-watch biopic. While interesting in its examination of some of the ways women are often manipulated and shouldered out of the limelight by men, this film can't help but feel a touch simplistic and trite in its resolution, especially in the #MeToo era."

      "text": "\"Big Eyes\" boasts a wonderful performance by Amy Adams, solid shot work, and bright colours; all letting us see some majesty in Keane's work. The story of Margaret Keane continues to be a relevant one in today's business/arts world. It's too bad, however, that Burton's trademark direction is far better suited for fantasies and the macabre, not for 'based on real events' dramas. The misdirection causes a nasty clash of styles that becomes especially revealing during the horrendously offbeat climax, spearheaded by an increasingly cheesy, over-the-top performance by Christoph Waltz."
