It looked like scenes taken from a dozen movies and blended together. It wasn't the worst movie I've seen but should have been so much better"

The sound track is great I will give it that, and the idea about the main character having a 'disability' is interesting but isn't explored properly.   Yes, the car chase scenes show a lot of great filming but get pretty redundant.   The main character doesn't really cut it as the 'reluctant' criminal.   He only goes straight when his hand is forced.   He could have made a positive decision much earlier in the film.   And all the killing and violence just seems thrown together in some kind of unreality.   It is hard to cheer for the main character who only seems to redeem himself at the very very end, which is much too late at least for me.   It had a lot of potential but lost me in the end."

The driving sequences are good, but the inter-personal conflicts are far too contrived. It's a heist movie, it's not hard to come up with good reasons for tension between criminals, and yet Baby Driver bends over backwards to create artificial tension with random thugs picking a fight with Baby even after he's saved their bacon. The movie also leans heavily on a romance that just doesn't really work all that well in my opinion, the girl is hopelessly in love with Baby from their first scene and it doesn't really go anywhere after that. Finally, Baby's over-wrought conscience is a bit hard to square with his actions in the film. We're supposed to see him as a good kid in a bad spot, but he is an accessory to dozens of serious crimes and put civilians in danger constantly. In the end, I would recommend Drive instead, but Baby Driver is still a good time."

      "text": "After being booted-off of Ant-Man, Edgar Wright put his energy into (what I imagine he considers to be his own Barry Lyndon), Baby Driver. Wright wanted to make a super-cool film like Drive or Widows, except Edgar Wright isn't cool \u2013 he's a massive nerd. Which is fine, and it worked well for  Scott Pilgrim vs the World, where you can embrace the finely choreographed action scenes, and laugh/cringe along with the rest of it.\rBaby Driver starts out like a tightly-choreographed modern-day musical, but soon devolves into a fairly generic action film. The soundtrack, blared at full-volume is interspersed with frustrating  whispered, mumbled, dialogue, which often feels like it's being read off the page, with exception of Lily James who brings a bit more emotional depth than the rest of the cast, who seem out of it.\rThere are a decent 20-minutes at the beginning of the third act where the tension builds. Unfortunately, the film then descends into every other action movie clich\u00e9 you can imagine.  The jokes aren't funny, but there are some clever set-pieces and flashy editing.  A better concept would have been to focus on the Bonnie & Clyde romance, with protagonist jacking cars and driving to the music which is already playing \u2013 which happens once when 'Baby' takes the car from the ATL Twins. For someone who professes to have watched 1000 great films (link omitted per site policy), (yet admits to falling asleep during Tokyo Story), it surprises me how immature and shallow Baby Driver is. I'm sure the film's target audience of teenagers believed it to be a masterpiece when they saw it. I only hope once they grow up, they will roll their eyes  at the thought.  Regardless, Edgar Wright is still a great film-making talent with a unique voice. This film may not have appealed to me, but others loved it. Best of luck to him."

On the down-side: Baby himself, slick moves or not, is a bland hero, too half-assed cool to register as anything but a nerdy director's fantasy alter-ego; his romance with singing waitress Debora is too-cute by half, stretching whatever credulity the pulpier stuff has, and clashing badly with the final act's cold-blooded mayhem; Kevin Spacey's on auto-pilot; and the ending trails off where it should speed across a definitive finish-line. Entertaining in fits and starts but, on balance, it hits too many pot-holes to fully satisfy."

The opening scene is so iconic in and of itself that it almost immediately makes the film for me. It sets up the idea that the film will be flowing with the soundtrack and that music is important to the main character because of some personal trauma.Where it drags for me are with two performances, those of Jamie Foxx and Kevin Spacey. For me Jamie Foxx is trying too hard to be an intimidating bad guy that he almost reaches Jared Leto's 'Joker' for me. Meanwhile, Kevin Spacey's performance is pretty lackluster and forgettable, even before the news about his past came out. His roll could've been better filled by someone else with a better presence, perhaps Kurt Russel? Overall it's a fun movie and has a lot of intricate sequences that should be watched with a keen eye, definitely give it a watch."

Sure I love Edgar Wright's direction in Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead and with Scott Pilgrim, but this movie is substandard at best as a comedy heist film. First, it does neither of its genre elements particularly well - I wasn't laughing nor particularly thrilled for most parts. The plot is very generic and lacks any sense of urgency for the most part. Character motivations are all over the place like Edgar Wright's hair and editing-wise, wasn't anything special. People seem to harp on about how great the action is and how its well timed to the songs, but I don't see anything great about it to be honest. Perhaps why I didnt like this film is that I've seen it before. That was a masterpiece called Drive and Baby Driver seems to borrow everything about it. The good things about Baby Driver is that it is midly entertaining and some of the songs are okay, I guess, apart from the fact its blasting at the audicence 24/7 like an angsty teen's mixtape."

This is no \"Drive,\" nor \"The Driver,\" and nothing close to that hair-raising street chase from \"Nightcrawler.\" This was \"The Transporter\" w/o a believable lead nor pulse-raising fight scenes. Or indeed, chase scenes worth recalling. \"Baby Driver\" does boast Jon Hamm's impression of The Terminator, and an ending that comes after what should have been the ending, after an uncomfortable amount of waiting time.To wit: This DOES NOT live up to its ridiculous amount of hype.

What makes this movie so great is that it's filled with memorable characters, packed with action, a great love story, and even a few surprises and twists that catch you off-guard. Ansel Elgort plays the cool Baby, a young driver whose job is to drive a group of criminals so they can heist. He works under the intimidating Doc (Kevin Spacey) who is very demanding when it comes to Baby. We see that Baby lives a quiet life looking after his deaf companion, and whatever money he makes, he uses it to feed him, and make sure he's well looked after. Baby attends to a diner, and meets a pretty young waitress named Debora (Lily James), who also shares a love for music. They seem to really hit it off, and this becomes a thing for the two of them. However, things get complicated when a thug named Bats (Jamie Foxx), who doesn't like to waste time, he prefers to do the job, and get away just like that, no other questions asked. The movie is impressive and entertaining, and proves even further that Edgar Wright is one of the most underrated filmmakers working today. With films from; 'Shaun of the Dead' (2004), to 'The World's End' (2013), he has proven to be both original, and using some effective camerawork to craft his films. I really liked the romantic chemistry between Elgort and James, and at a time where many movies are filled with unnecessary and somewhat bland romantic subplots, theirs is honestly the best one I've seen since 'Deadpool' (2016). Hopefully, in the future, we get more films that are as expertly crafted and equally as fun as this. Probably the most fun movie in 2017."

To base a whole film around a soundtrack is almost certainly asking for trouble and inevitably Edgar Wright's idea and direction are both a lot better than his screenplay, which on more than a few occasions pushed the bounds of credibility. The cast are firing on all cylinders but the film annoyingly see-saws between good and fair throughout due to some loose writing. Strangely the music choices are often only ok, although credit must be given for them not having been over used in other films. Standout music piece is a track by 'Focus'(taken from Focus Three if I'm not mistaken)to accompany a chase sequence on foot involving 'Baby Driver' Ansel Elgort, who for once is actually good in a role. As befits a crime thriller the editing is sharp and the sound is clear. It must be said that the film definitely leaves an impression after disappearing from the screen. I just wish that the writing could have made that impression more consistent for me to appreciate the resultant movie better."

The film was well shot, the sound editing was amazing, and the cast was fantastic.  Ansel Elgort as \u201cBaby\u201d played a very likable but conflicted main protagonist. His performance supplemented by a great supporting cast (Eiza Gonzalez, Jamie Fox, John Ham, and Kevin Spacy).   Worth mentioning, the movie had a very well-coordinated continuous shot, as well as amazing implantation of song and sound. Edgar Wright and Team were able to turn the movie into a best hits playlist without it becoming boring or stagnant.  The way in which song was incorporated into each scene was unique and did not take away from the story.  I recommend this film to anyone looking for a new original screen play, or fans of fast moving crime films."

      "text": "Tarantino-like shots are almost to epidemic levels at this point. It's seems to be the medicine directors with poor scripts are taking. The film rarely lets it actors speak for themselves without constant sweeping pans or snappy close-ups on all small actions. All the same, the dialogue was pure meathead. Last one alive wins. I'm cool with that if I'm watching Rambo but I thought this movie was going to have a different angle. It devolved into a cheesefest so quickly. The glowing reviews for Baby Driver is a prime example or critical inertia."

The motives aren't explained, everything just happens and you're supposed to find it interesting?  There isn't anything appealing about this movie, it's just a continuous stream of action packed dribble.  Watch if you like music movies and car chases. Put it on in the background if you want to keep your TV on."

After 30 mins I stopped noticing it.The main character (and his girlfriend as well) was acting cocky and self confident, like if he was really cool, while actually he wasn't.It looked rediculously stupid.I will never base my cinema plans on Metacritic and IMDb ratings again.It's like in one moment everyone just lost the taste."

Most of the movie consists of manufactured conflict between characters who are written as unreasonable idiots.  And it's all too bad because all the actors here are good and giving it a good try.  But the writing is very weak.  But who cares about the story, you're here for the car chases, right?  Yikes.  They're pretty boring.  Sure, the cinematography is good, but Wright goes overboard here and you'll often see cars spinning unnecessarily.  Also, the ending is so infantile I laughed out loud.  Skip this one and go watch Shaun of the Dead again."

      "text": "The first three scenes of the movie had me smiling uncontrollably. They set the stage: Baby is introduced, we get some hints at the dark deal behind the scenes, and we learn that music is everything. The intro was so unique and fresh that I almost didn't notice as every subsequent scene played out beat for beat exactly as one might have expected from the intro, right down to the obvious deaths and betrayals and the disgusting, regressive film stereotypes. The lead man, the lead villain, and the lead criminal are all white men. The female love interest is mindlessly devoted to her man. The white guy criminal is suave and gets the most screen time of the criminals, his wife is sexy and a reflection of him, and the black guy is a scary criminal. I kept expecting my expectations to be subverted because my expectations were embarrassingly bland, but alas. Each character can be described fully in one short, nuance-free sentence, and if you leave the theater saying, \"What a unique ____!\" I can guarantee that word isn't \"plot.\""
