I'm as liberal as anyone but this was way over the top in my opinion. \"Wish fulfillment\" is the best diagnosis of what went wrong here--with crappy dialog and overly simplistic, one-dimensional characters (poor Greg Kinnear) it felt like a 12-year-old writing a historical-fiction war story for a creative writing assignment. Normally like Ebert, but he was way, way too kind to this film. Entirely forgettable film meant to cheaply evoke frustration over a national tragedy for commercial gain."

If you believe George Bush was a good president , than don't see this film. Our Iraq war was a mess and history has already shown that whatever happened and why , the whole reason behind the invasion was a hoax. The movie is one persons attempt to explain why we wasted all that time,money, and lives. Dick Chaney would not give this film thumbs up. I thought it was well done."

Instead of a critical examination of the role of civilian leadership in the reconstruction of Baghdad, we get a rah-rah-rah, there is no WMD in Iraq and we've all been duped! No look at Matt Damon act passionate and champion a cause after it is already mainstream. This isn't analysis of the political leanings of the film or cast, rather this is an outline of the plot structure. Formulaic and so overtly black and white that it is cringe worthy. Their is no moral grey, the bad guys are simply bad guys and the good guys have no moral flaw, beyond \"they're too just!\". The characters are so cookie cutter that you can't root for the good guys and the bad guys are so generic that you don't care if they get away with it or are killed. The resolution of the film is empty, because it so blatantly puts an oversimplified message ahead of a good story and characterization. That is the biggest problem in the film, by taking a political non-fiction book and turning it into a fictional military 'thriller' that is heavy handed in its message it loses all meaning and turns you away from caring. Where a subtle hand was needed, we got a megaphone wielding wacko screaming from the roofs."

Three years later  Greengrass directed one of the last decades   most acclaimed  and most controversial films \"United 93\"(2006) based on the true story of the heroism of the passengers and there tragic death when they forced the plane into a nose dive  causing it  to crash near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The film was a massive critical success but meet with extreme criticism form audiences alike over its touchy source material. The year after Greengrass and actor Matt Damon  re-teamed to star and direct the third(and possibly final installment)  of the hugely successful Bourne series  with  the \"Bourne Ultimatum\"(2007)  which proved to be the highest grossing and biggest critically acclaimed hit of the series bringing a crashing final close to the saga of Jason Bourne. For nearly three years Greengrass was  working on a new project that while may lack the enthusiasm of his early works  is no less thought provoking or  thrilling as his  earlier works. This film is one of his best and a film that not only gives you the views of why we go to war but if the reasons we do go to war are really for the right reasons.  When I first heard of Paul Greengrass'  \"Green Zone\" back in  late 2009   I can say that I was  extremely excited  to see  Greengrass and Damon  back together again making a big action picture again  I could almost picture how this film would  have played out in my head(no thanks to my limitless imagination). I saw Damon playing a solider fighting against another Government conspiracy involving some sort of political assassination or cover up  that he exposed. I was eager with anticipation however, when I found out the release date of this film my anticipation dwindled. It dwindled not because I found out the film might not be as good as it appears but it dwindled because I would have to wait three months into 2010 to see one of my most anticipated films of 2010. After nearly two months of waiting I finally was able to see Paul Greengrass' \"Green Zone\u00e2"

      "text": "Stephen Glass, the reporter who fabricated articles for The New Republic, never killed anybody with his lies. He can be forgiven. \"Hack Heaven\" didn't result in wounded flesh and shattered bone. In \"The Green Zone\", Amy Ryan portrays a Wall Street Journal reporter named Lawrie Dayne, who is obviously a stand-in for the New York Times journalist who sold the WMD story to the public. Disappointingly, the film goes easy on her, since Lawrie is depicted as a victim, a burned writer, misled by her fellow countrymen. Clark Poundstone(Greg Kinnear), a Pentagon Special Intelligence agent, gives Lawrie the run-around on the airport tarmac when she requests a meeting with Magellan, Clark's informer. Thereafter, the naif scribe notices Warrant Officer Roy Miller(Matt Damon) talking to a senior CIA officer, and subsequently, in her hotel room, she admits to filing a story based on hearsay. While the character of Roy Miller functions like Oliver Stone's take on New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison in \"J.F.K.\", our anger towards Lawrie is tempered, because the filmmaker cushions the blow of her war propaganda by giving this opportunistic journalist, SOME scruples. Across her visage, there's a look of humiliation while she relays her shaky reporting methods to the dumbfounded soldier. Lawrie was the government's tool, but she believed her story; believed in Clark. He betrayed her trust. Although \"The Green Zone\" is a superior action film with camerawork that can only be described as virtuoistic(perhaps, genius), the story should be told through the reporter's eyes; a reporter who is the anti-Woodward, the anti-Bernstein. \"The Green Zone\" may be a conspiracy movie, but the filmmaker doesn't go far enough. It's too fair, too balanced, since in all probability, the real-life Lawrie Dayne was \"The President's Woman\". If moviegoerswants to see Matt Damon kick ass, they can watch any of the three Jason Bourne movies."

If we have a man like that there, how can it be Bad? So clearly, Hurt Locker was not political. Green Zone's politics are its MacGuffin.

Ok, this is getting pretty silly. Action is well done, and the direction continues to impress. Very reminiscent of director's other work. However, the script is soooo weak. It seems like it's trying to boil all the problems about the war down to a few archetypal characters: the cynical old expert that no one listens to anymore, the close minded younger administrator that refuses to see the big picture, the crusading grunt that follows the good no matter where it leads...none of these people are developed as...people. Everyone does a pretty good job with what they have to work with, however. I think we are sliding further and further out of reality. This film is certainly no \"Hurt Locker.\" It is more fun, to be sure. The \"truth about WMD\" is the apparent heart of the story, which everyone watching this film already knows, and this might be the weakest link in the film, from a strictly 'thriller' standpoint. 1:11:00 into the film and Bush is declaring victory. It's these moments that pull you out of the fantasy of the 'thriller' aspect of the film and remind you that what it's using for fodder is a war that cost thousands of American and allied and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi lives, and to accomplish a completely imaginary goal . Not a plus for getting lost in the story, which continues to be heavy handed and rushed. Good scene between Damon and Iraqi General character. However, the narrative which has been slowly shifting from WMD to the beginning of the insurgency is unfortunately lacking in lots of elements, attempting to blame the coming violence on debathification and the disbanding of the military alone. This is a gross oversimplification, and if you are trying to inject a message into your action film, you are going to have to be judged by the message as much as the action. Ok, the film's over, and here's my verdict. The direction was great, and the actors all put in good performances. The story was very spotty. The weighty message of the film seemed to be \"America wanted the war and duped it's own military into fighting it for spurious reasons.\" This story has been told much better and much more honestly by filmmakers and media alike. I suppose if you enjoy your talking points with explosions and chase scenes, then this film is definitely your cup of tea, assuming you agree with said talking points. I enjoy a good thriller and I enjoy a good expos\u00e9 but mixing the two very rarely succeeds, and this film is no exception."
