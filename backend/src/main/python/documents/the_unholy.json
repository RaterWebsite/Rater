When terrifying events begin to happen all around, he starts to question if these phenomena are the works of the Virgin Mary or something much more sinister.",

      "text": "The Unholy is an awkward film that ultimately tries to leave the viewer with a positive message but not even a positive message can make this a good film. The horror film is centered exclusively around jump scares and with that exception has zero horror. The writing holds the viewer's hand in an already simple plot. A lot of the rules established in the film are broken even minutes after being created. Despite how fast-paced the movie seems, it still feels like it's dragging on at times. In the end, you are left with two messages: one about truth and one about faith. Both messages feel unearned and almost slapped together. The real shame is that the film does seem like it could be saved. In fact, without any reshoots and just some simple editing choices, I feel this movie could've been a lot better (and even saved some money on some horrid CGI). If you are a horror fan aching for some new horror - I would skip. If you are a film fan I would definitely skip it. Finally, there are some visuals in this film (early and in the very end) that make absolutely zero sense and almost like they were purposely there for a trailer."

The performances from Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Cricket Brown, Marina Mazepa, William Sadler, and Katie Aselton were excellent. The visual effects were awesome, so cool and creepy. The makeup and hairstyling was outstanding especially the Mary Elnor makeup on Marina Mazepa. Overall a pretty enjoyable movie."

      "text": "If you are even considering seeing the Unholy, whether you are using Amazon, YouTube or even an illegal stream, all I can say is save your time.  This movie is the most disappointing horror movie in recent memory, given how good the trailers looked.  I don't know how, but Screen Gems managed to take a decent concept, good actors and a pre-existing amount of hype and make that into 99 agonizing minutes of boring, suspenseless \"horror\".  Let's start off with what this movie does well: The concept and the setting.  The idea of a demon pretending to be the Virgin Mary, and using that as a way into a young girl is great, and the creepy setting of a small New England town suits the film well.  Unfortunately, that is where the list of positives ends.  The characters range from unlikeable to borderline cartoon villains (William Sadler's \"Father Hagan\"), and the atmosphere of the movie is far more boring than creepy, featuring the usual run of overused scenes like the characters being in a creepy church basement or a rural farm house.  Overall, the unlikable, poorly written and developed characters, and absolute butchering of the concept makes the Unholy an overall regrettable experience.  The trailer reveals way too much.  Going into the movies, there is the feeling that there is supposed to be a sense of mystery, but all along it is blatantly that it is a demon, not Mary, and that all the people with Alice Saves t-shirts coming to her for help are both in trouble and hailing a demon.  The demon itself looks awful, putting all former CGI demons to shame.  Ultimately, the best way I could describe the demon is looking like Vigil from Rainbow Six Siege.  With no suspense, no real scares beyond the occasional jump scares, and characters that you find hard to root for or care about, The Unholy is a disappointing experience that doesn't leave me wanting more, it leaves me wanting my time and $4.99 back."
