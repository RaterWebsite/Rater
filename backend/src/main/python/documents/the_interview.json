It is about how the media appeals to our emotions to get us to feel a certain way about certain things. It is about how our opinions on certain events are mainly driven by how the media portrays them. This is a recurring idea throughout the movie, and it takes many forms. It criticizes the United States a lot more than you would think as well. The movie's screenplay deserves credit for its shrewd observations of the media and human emotions, and for its exciting story line. The opening scene, a song, is simultaneously hilarious for its lyrical content, and chilling for its disturbing social implication. In terms of comedy, there are a few clever jokes written, but the comedy, while there is a lot of it, mainly comes from the performances, especially from James Franco and Randall Park, who also both perform well in their dramatic scenes. The scene with the actual interview is one of my favorite scenes of the year. The movie deserves Oscar nominations for Franco, Park, and for the screenplay, but of course that will not happen, because the movie will be scoffed at by people who will never give it the credit it deserves simply because they will never be able to see past the fact that it is a James Franco / Seth Rogen comedy."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Best movie I've ever seen in my entire life!

Otherwise I advise to spend you time watching something else."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Despite its initial hype concerning the actual North Korean government threatening the US because of this movie, \"The Interview\" turns out to be a major disappointment, with the buddy chemistry between Rogen and Franco failing miserably and the plot hitting a huge downfall starting from the second act."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I didn't find the movie to be entirely funny.

A TV chat show host is going to North Korea to interview Kim Jong-Un when the CIA get involved and tell him he must assassinate the leader while he is there. There are laughs to be had here but they are few and far between. As with all comedies from the Seth Rogan camp, scenes are allowed to go on way past their natural end point and it would seem most actors are told to go as BIG as possible. Worst offender here is James Franco, whose performance is nails-on-a-blackboard annoying!! In the end this is a inconsequential film that doesn't deserve the publicity that North Korea has given it, and in a years time we will all be struggling to remember what all the fuss was about"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I dont know why so many people dislike this movie, its maybe because of type of humor.

But reading the ridiculous click-bait articles about this movie \"It's racist\" \"It's sexist\" \"It makes light of North Korea\" are just click-bait. This movie is about as offensive as the Wedding Crashers. It's bawdy humor folks, grow up, Seth Rogen make a sex joke? Color me shocked.\r And to pretend like this is beyond the pale because it depicts an assassination, I'd refer the critics to literally any action movie from the 90s wherein almost every protagonist assassinates Saddam Hussein or Gaddafi.\r The movie was fun, it was gross, and it had a bit of heart.

Although the film restricts its use of crude teenage humour, the overall tone never really goes beyond an adolescent mind. Are James Franco and Seth Rogen funny? Yes. Did this film cross any lines in terms of political content? Not really.\r The portrayal of Kim Jong-Un is not even close to how dehumanizing it could have been. The pop culture references throughout the film accent the premise of Franco as a talk show host who is up-to-date on current events, but the narrative had so much potential and fell very, very short.\r The Interview is nothing special and the only reason for Korea's disgust towards it would be the dethroning of the fearless leader off his godly pedestal. This film is Team America: World Police meets Tropic Thunder and it delivers exactly what you expect it to. I had high hopes for The Interview despite its controversial topic given the success of Franco and Rogen's last film This Is The End, but it just failed to deliver the smart comedy it could have been."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "My very low expectations of this film were completely wrong.

Something in me tells me the \"hack\" may have been a big publicity stunt to generate hype, because without all the hype, I could easily see this movie being a huge bomb.  It did have funny parts, but the plot and the humor overall was sub-par from what I expect from this team.  It seemed the anti- North Korea parts were overblown and really not needed.

This movie was funny at times but not like what I had hoped. It may be the controversy that surrounded this film that will result in its downfall. Its not the worst movie I ever saw but it certainly wasn't worth all the drama. Of course its offensive, in the beginning it appeared to be fairly non-controversial but the ending will surly offend some people. I was disappointed with James Franco in this movie, it seemed like Seth Rogen took the beat seat although he was a co-writer, but his role was tolerable. James Franco seemed like he was playing himself and it made me lose some respect for him as an actor because he was a stupid douchebag for the whole movie. Obviously Sony has lost 44 million on this movie and will likely not come close to gaining it back with the film being in a limited amount of theatres.

The Interview offers little that is truly intelligent and if you are familiar with the movies that Seth Rogen and James Franco make together then you know what to expect: vulgarity, immaturity and sophomoric humor that we feel a need to apologize for laughing at. The irony is after all the reports of the horrors of North Korea that have been given little notice, the headlines and furor caused by this stupid Hollywood film has brought more attention to the matter then anything else and if that isn't the ultimate satire and sad commentary on the world today I don't know what is.\rVerdict: For the Franco & Rogen fan."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "The movie was painful to pay 6 bucks for, and even more painful to watch.

The entire plot is set up only to make North Korea look bad, not that it is unwarranted, however none of the jokes were original or actually made me laugh, they just felt forced and did not add to the humor at all. The only part that actually made me laugh was the beginning with eminem and the fight scene behind the cameras during the actual interview.\r Overall, this movie got way more attention than it deserved, and it probably would've been just another comedy turd shat out by the film industry like the rest of them were it not for the real-life events that preceded it's release."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Foreign conflict movies used to be smart and funny; movies like Spies Like Us, MASH, Dr. Strangelove, Top Secret!, Stripes and so on but The Interview takes Kim Jong Un combined with a fart joke and makes and entire movie disguised as a media satire comedy out of it.  Really though, what would you expect from two stoners who know nothing but potty humor?  The Interview has an okay start but ends up being something in the 'worst things you have ever watched' category.  This movie extra sucks for all the negative hype it generated only for the payoff to be worth nothing.  The world is going to see this movie after all the threats that have been made and digital hacks that have been accomplished and say \"They deserved it.\"  For Seth Rogan to go on television and say that this movie wasn't created to cause controversy makes him just as idiotic as this movie was.  This movie relies on celebrity cameos and bottom of the bucket humor to keep it going, but again, we've seen the same in every other one of his movies so not sure why I expected anything different.  Only difference between this and his other 'great' works are that instead of this one being based in a frat house its based in the in the real life setting of the supreme leader of North Korea WHO just so happens to be a film buff, like his insane father, as well a hot head about global relations at the moment; so for Rogan to say nothing was intended by this movie is a total lie.  Maybe years down the road when this conflict is over, yes, but not in the heat of it.  If this fat, unfunny stoner really just made things for the world worse over a nearly unwatchable 'comedy' then I vote that it's time for this guy to go away."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Sony is overestimating their work.

W/o helps of North Korea hackers, this film will never stand even a single day in US cinemas."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Kim Jong Un probably was responsible for the Sony hack. Maybe he ordered it after he saw the trailer. Then after the accusations of said hack they demanded to co-investigate or else. Things where heating up, North Korea was bringing their army in a state readiness. The keys for the nukes where already in the ignition and all battle-stations manned. WWIII was looming over Western Civilization. The end of mankind was nigh. All this probably happened while Kim was waiting for his copy of the film to arrive (on a Harddisk with a truck coz their internet was down thx to the Yankees). When he did finally see it he came to realize: this is just another stupid Seth Rogen comedy full of fart and f*ck jokes. I'm not wasting my Nukes over this! Soon after they released their statement that they didn't approve of the film's release (or any other future Seth Rogen comedies for that matter) but wouldn't retaliate. The world was safe again.\rSeriously, if they would have started WWIII over this, I would kill Seth Rogen myself if he somehow would have survived. Look, this 9,9/10 score on imdb is not a score for the movie itself. It's a reaction to Kim Jong Un's hack and his threats. So let me give this movie a realistic score: 6/10. It's actually not too bad as far as Seth Rogen comedies go, sometimes it was actually funny. Franco plays a retarded news presenter, Rogen plays the straight guy (cfr Pineapple Express). There is some criticism on the American media and it's obsession with fame as well as on suppressing regimes in general. But let's face it: this movie is just entertainment meant to entertain you for 107 mins and it does that fairly well. 'The Interview' wont change your life or the world. It's not a work a cinematic art to be remembered and cherished for years to come. Sony must be thinking they got the best free advertisement for the movie they could have ever dreamed. Now people will want to see it just to know what the fuss was all about.\rI do agree that people should be able to make any movie they want but in the end even Kim Jong-un must have cursed himself for making such a fuss about it. If he just kept quit it would have been a moderate success, after a few months it would have gone to DVD/BD and after a couple of years few people would have remembered it. Kim, you're advisers should have told you to keep your big mouth shut :)"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Were it not for the hack, this movie would have been an unknown bomb quietly fizziling to an early DVD release.
