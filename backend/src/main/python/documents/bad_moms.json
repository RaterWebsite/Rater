And here is one such case. In Bad Moms, there is a scene that mocks non-circumcised men. Yes, let that sink in: this excrescence of a movie body-shames men for *not* having their genitals mutilated. This is far beyond unfunny, this is morally unacceptable."

In theory this should be a good movie, great cast, but uses the same \"bad\" behavior for cheap laughs that every other \"bad\" movie uses. The plot and setting are a painful reinforcement of gender stereotypes, with moms that do everything, even their kids homework. In 2016 this shouldn't even be being made and it is completely offensive that the child says she won't get into ivy league and will have to become a \"teacher\". Can see how they really value education by the clever and witty plot and multi-dimensional characters, oh wait, they don't have those."

The message the movie was telling is an important one, a huge dynamic in today's world of motherhood, however it's portrayed in an escapist tone.  To give bravado to being a bad parent and cheap meaningless sexual encounters with even shallower characters.  A most Madame Defarge account of today.  There are many ways these issues can be addressed.  Education, research, self betterment.  Instead to show recklessness and drugalcoholist as answers to the issue is negligent and unintelligent.  Frat boys do a movie on bad moms!  I expected much more from an intelligent person such as Mila Kunis."

It is utterly dismissive of the male role in the family unit, to such an extent that calling it dismissive fails to capture how irrelevant the writers consider men in the lives of the moms and children portrayed.  The film endeavors to suggest that female empowerment in the family unit can only be accomplished through emasculation and dismissal of the male.  It goes on to portray abandonment of responsibility, substance abuse and casual sex as the only viable pathway to happiness and personal fulfillment for moms suffering from a lack of support at home.  To call the plot of this movie far-fetched just wildly understates the level of abandonment of credulity that this work required."

She makes 2 friends (Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn, who creates the movie's most enjoyable character) and they set out to make the title come true. This is the ultimate chick flick. The audience was almost exclusively women and they were loving it. The script crammed full of F-bombs and wacky acts, much of them funny. As is the fate of many modern movies, it sometimes tries too hard to be outrageous. The mom message gets a bit heavy-handed, but there are moments of genuine sweetness that adds to the appeal. Fun for moms and highly relatable with its amusing approach."

      "text": "I watched Bad Moms with my fiancee. I was mildly excited for the movie as I am a big fan of all three leads. All three women do a fine job with the script they have been given. It is only because of my appreciation of these three that I even gave this movie a four. Their strong screen presences (particularly Kristen Bell's weird stay at home mom) carried what is otherwise a dumpster fire of a film. First lets just get the main message of the film out of the way. It repeatedly depicts that men are bumbling, incompetent, and narcissistic. Even Amy's (Mila Kunis) son is presented as a spoiled brat while her daughter is a hard working but stressed achiever. The only male presented in an even slightly positive light is a widower who is just a vapid body for Amy to have rebound sex with. No men are shown at the PTA meetings, taking care of their kids, or doing anything remotely parental. If some rampant sexist depictions of women were done in the name of \"comedy\" the movie would universally be panned. Instead the film continues the growing trend that it is okay to depict (white) men as buffoons. The rest of the plot of the movie is basically paint by numbers. There are nuanced characters or any real insight besides \"moms are the best but society demands too much of them.\""

Everything is so over-exaggerated and simultaneously over-simplified, ugh. The main characters are all sterotyped caricatures.

      "text": "\"Kent and I have sex every Friday night after Blue Bloods. I find Tom Selleck's work to be very erotic.\"-Kristen Bell as KikiPart comedy, part ode to mothers, Bad Moms is an often funny comedy that boasts a cast of characters with great chemistry with one another, but has an incredibly weak plot. With cliches left and right, Bad Moms is a typical unsuspecting hero rises to the top against all odds against a evil villain who is not actually that evil story. I explained it poorly, but if you watch enough movies (at least more than 10 in your life), you are well accustomed to this storyline. This element certainly holds the film back and though the film's plot and jokes are very typical for a modern comedy, its characters have enough charisma and venom to make them stick the landing.Led by Mila Kunis, who stars as \"bad mom\" Amy Mitchell, this cast has some seriously comedic chops amongst them. Joining Kunis are Kathryn Hahn as slutty mom Carla and Kristen Bell as weird mom Kiki and together, the three kill every scene they are in. With raunchy humor coming from every direction, the joke repertoire is pretty limited. Yet, these ladies make it work for them. However, the best part here is actually the characters. Overworked, overstressed, and suffering from a cheating husband, Kunis' Amy Mitchell tries her best, but it is never enough for her kids or anyone in her life. Here, Bad Moms truly celebrates this hero. Though often overlooked, this mom who may not be the best, but tries her hardest and does a good job deserves recognition and this film is willing to give it to her. This is largely the film's greatest accomplishment. Otherwise, Carla is just slutty and Kiki is just weird. They lament about the men in their lives and, to be fair, the men in their lives suck. However, the trio is united in their love of their children, no matter how bratty and rude they can be to them, which is a real testament to moms as a whole. Unabashedly a chick flick, Bad Moms feels the need to borrow from past chick flicks with useless men, guys who the women fawn over, and of course, having its own personal \"mean girls\". The first two elements are whatever. It is a chick flick after all. However, Mean Girls already handled the topic of the \"queen bee\" and her little minions. Here, Bad Moms introduces its queen **** as Gwendolyn James (Christina Applegate) and her two lackees Stacy (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Vicky (Annie Mumolo). Vicky is hysterical with her aloof nature and willingness to just go against the tide to do whatever her scatter brain desires. However, Gwendolyn and Stacy are so typical, it is a shame. The plot is cliche, but make no mistake, so are the characters here. Together, they combine for a sea of cliches that hit with greater and greater intensity throughout.In complaining, however, I do not want this point to be lost: Bad Moms is not that bad. A cliche and modern comedy in all the worst ways at times, Bad Moms can also be hysterical. With a light and fun atmosphere and a lighting quick pace, Bad Moms evades being killed by its negative qualities and instead delivers a quality summer comedy that is nothing but disposable entertainment. Though not a woman or a mother, I can safely guess that Bad Moms would be the perfect idea for a get together of middle aged women. It is raunchy, yes, but it does have a story that will resonate with that demographic and it certainly celebrates these women who selflessly dedicate themselves to those who do not the same for them. This makes for an appealing chick flick for that demographic and it will likely be celebrated a such. For guys, it is a pretty funny movie and you can do far worse when it comes to clear chick flicks. At the very worst, Mila Kunis, Kathryn Hahn, and Kristen Bell, are incredibly funny here and deliver quite good performances that do often rise above the material."

So most of the younger audience won't get it, as well as the older people, because of the generation gap. I enjoyed it, but you know this is nothing close to any classic on the similar theme, just a decent entertainer though. From the director of '21 & Over', about the three moms whose children are in the high school, but it depicts those moms struggles over maintain the order in their professional and personal life.\r Mila Kunis' character is the centre of the story, but I liked Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn as well. Basically, these three ruled the narration. Some of the comedies were good, though there are too much of sexual references in that. Not good as 'How to be Single', but definitely better than both the 'Bad Neighbours' films.\r It got a mixed response, but a box office hit. Most of the story is predictable, though decently developed all the scenes by keeping them simple. I mean clich\u00e9 wise, but at some parts it gets loud and out of control. So make sure you are not watching for any inspiration, but the middle aged people feel more familiar with this than anybody else.

Yup people lap this rubbish up!"

I got a couple of laughs out of it but most of the humor is rooted to much in reality and is (sadly) too relevant to be as funny as at should be. In all honestly I kinda liked it but wanted it to be a bit filthier. Well cast too."

Vulgar, sexist, and with a script written by 12 years olds, this film is perfect for the misogynist in your social group. For the rest of us, I rate this film 'thumbs down' for stupidity."

      "text": "This is unwatchable. The plot has so many holes that make me scratch my head: How can a movie writer even start to conceptualize this ***fest!?The plot: a mom who works as a secretary even though her husband made so much dough that HE apparently doesn't have to work, they live in (you guessed it) the safest suburb in all of america and deal with 0 of the social issues which over 70% of the country has to deal with. Instead, she deals with the most basic chores as they've exaggerated them immensely so that the audience sides with her when she decides to stop doing all of them for no good reason. biggest red flag from this movie was the single mom portrayed as a FLAT character who's trashy attitude is considered excusable.This is the issue with this movie: nothing is grounded. 0 characters actually make sense or are reasonable. Due to this aspect, none of the movie is actually funny. It's basically an excuse so that any mom that is emotionally driven can say \"YEah! THat's RIght! THis is HOw I FEel TOo!!!!1!\".Here are two of the biggest character offenses in this movie:Character A) \"the protagonist\"The protagonist mom is portrayed as the hero of this movie. Not some tragic hero that has a broken past and tries to better herself, no. She's played as an ENTITLED hero from her broken past in which she's allowed to do whatever she wants and consequences which are caused by this attitude are supposed to be forgiven by the audience (as shown at the end of the movie, when she cries about the fact that the kids went with the dad for the divorce because the kids were scared of the fact that she literally had a drunken party the other day.... no joke that's how **ty the plot is). We're supposed to feel sorry for her during the whole movie and it kind of makes me sick. This isn't like a Bad Santa movie, where the degenerate character is lead by some ***ed up circumstances which weren't in the control of said character, causing them to act like a looney. This is a character which is shown as a \"good parent\" (they portrayed this super badly in the movie) in which the parent IS ALWAYS at a loss in her SELFLESS (not really) acts, which she then decides to postpone these acts for no particular reason other than insecurity. And I'm supposed to feel bad for this person? I'm supposed to forgive her actions because she committed them out of insecurity? The ending of the story simply justifies her actions instead of showing an actual ethical moral resolve.... which will surely make the audience cringe.Character B) The \"dad\"The dad is shown as (one of) the antagonist of this story. His character is flat and his whole backstory is narrated just like every other character in this movie (this is a movie sin btw). The dad is said to act like a child for some reason, reason being that he's rich enough to do this....? This is the biggest plot hole in this movie. The couple met during college and the dad became ultra successful off of a contract deal (I believe in the business of property if I'm not mistaken) and he has enough money to buy a house, buy himself a classic car (which at the time of the movie's released would've been a 50-100K classic just from looking at the paintjob and detailed interior), and he decides to basically retire? From my interpretation of the movie, a man of this calibre is either going to retire early on due to him being RICH ENOUGH TO NOT NEED A DIME THE REST OF HIS LIFE or somehow he suffered some sort of block (either physical or mental) from his work, causing him to not want to work. So either the family is well off and the mom doesn't ever need to work OR the family isn't well off and the mom should tell the dad to work. Since in the movie, it was never mentioned that the dad should work, I'm sad to say that seems as though the mom busts her ass for no reason, intensifying the fact that she's the worst tragic hero I've ever ***ing seen! All in all, this was the worst portrayed character since he didn't seem to have a reason to act like a child and it seems as though the writers wrote him as ass clown."

The film is a thoroughly enjoyable, a few good laughs and good direction. I loved all the times the film would go into slow motion (Especially the Grocery Store) The film isn\u2019t perfect; at times it feels like you\u2019ve seen this plot before, but you go with it anyways. Unfortunately, they are already planning a sequel and spin off (Bad Dads), totally unnecessary, but typical Hollywood lets go for the money grab (Neighbours 2) Sometimes a simple concept should stay contained in one film, go make something else original, not double and triple dipping in the well (Hangover series)"
