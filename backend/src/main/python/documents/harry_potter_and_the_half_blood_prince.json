Harry suspects perils may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemorts defenses and to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information. Even as the decisive showdown looms, romance blossoms for Harry, Ron, Hermione and their classmates. Love is in the air, but danger lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again.",

      "text": "The somewhat penultimate installment of the \"Harry Potter\" stories by J.K. Rowling leads us closer to the end than we ever anticipated, with 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince', we see our main heroes nearing adulthood and adapting to bigger changes. Plus, we get an insight to how the Dark Lord can be defeated.\r Our main hero, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) returns with Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) in order to find a former Hogwarts professor named Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) and bring him back to Hogwarts despite his reluctance. It seems that Horace knows about what the young Voldermort, known as \"Tom Riddle\" was asking for when he was teaching him back in his student days. Dumbledore needs Harry to try and get answers out of Horace, but that seems to be a difficult task on its own.\r Harry returns to Hogwarts with Ron (Rupert Grint), Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ginny (Bonnie Wright), and he notices that Draco (Tom Felton) is acting a little suspicious, he suspects that he might possess something mysterious linking to the Dark Lord. Meanwhile, at class, Harry discovers an old text-book that has writing all over it, written by \"The Half-Blood Prince\", and it seems that this book has all the answers and that Harry can possess great power thanks to this mysterious prince.\r Harry attempts everything he can to try and get some answers out of Horace, but still couldn't be able to get anything. Hermione seems to be getting emotionally devastated in regards to Ron falling in love with another Hogwarts student, it seems even more clear that Hermione is infatuated with Ron, but is unable to express her emotion, especially since Ron is unwilling to listen as he already has a girlfriend.\r Harry also suspects that Draco and Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) are planning something which relates to them serving the Dark Lord. He believes that they are out to kill. Harry is also still upset at the death of his godfather, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), which was done in the hands of the menacing Bellatrix Lastrange (Helena Bonham-Carter), and he is still filled with violent revenge, especially knowing about some dark wizard powers that was written by the \"Half-Blood Prince\".\r 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince' is a much darker movie than the previous installments, the cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel is suitably de-saturated to fit the darker tone, especially the more slow-paced storytelling. There are some surprisingly quirky moments, involving Harry's character that add some much needed levity to the darker side of the franchise.\r This is a more character driven movie, and I did like it better than \"The Order of the Phoenix\" (2007), I liked the darker and duller tone, I liked the fact that the characters are more fleshed out than ever, and I liked the funnier and quirky moments. This is a very sharp movie, and brings us closer to the end that makes you more excited, it's definitely one for movie-goers who like their characters fleshed out and the action, more compact."

      "text": "Half Blood Prince is the darkest of all Harry Potter films - quite literally. The grading effect applied to almost every single shot give the film an almost sepia tone, making the film look like the sets were illuminated solely by candles. However, given that this sixth instalment of the franchise is the most emotionally painful to go through, it works.Characters who have previously hovered mainly in the background finally take centre-stage. Tom Felton shows us a side to Malfoy - and himself - we never thought existed, and some of the finest work in Alan Rickman's career can be seen in this film. Finally, with regards to Dumbledore, one wonders how Richard Harris would have approached the material had he survived to the sixth film. His take on the character in the first two instalments is decidedly different to Gambon's in subsequent films. Nonetheless, Gambon certainly owns the part in this one, and there can be no doubt that he truly is Dumbledore.Alongside the emotionally weighty scenes is the franchise's trademark charming humour - supplied predominantly by Grint, Lynch and newcomers Jim Broadbent and Jessie Cave. The action scenes are very well shot, and the dark scenes are truly terrifying. After the final scene, you will be dying to find out what happens next."

      "text": "The saga thickens up.This film is the adaptation of the sixth book in the Harry Potter saga, written by JK Rowling and was directed by David Yates. Always betting on the continuity of its main cast, as well as in the ability of its studios when it comes to special effects and computerization, Yates manages to make a great movie. The script also becomes increasingly complex and dense. The loves and crossed romances will increasingly join the central plot, and that will help to thickens it and make the film more and more adult and mature, deeper and psychologically challenging. The actors will also gaining more and more experience and maturity and will raise their performance to ever higher levels.This film is one of the first where the audience gets to see the other side of some characters. So far, everything was very black and white, there were good guys and bad guys. Now it will no longer be so, with some of the characters to show gray sides of their personalities. The photograph will accompany all these changes, becoming increasingly cold and dark."

With him dead, Harry is given a note that he faked the deathcrux, the only key to Voldemort's immortality in which he and his friends will succeed in finding them. Saw it with my sister in theaters at the same year and now I will make my opinion just to make this review short. The acting.....amazing The fantasy action.....great The storyline.....well-paced The sad where Professor Dumbledore dies.....so sad it will make you cry your eyes out. The characters.....a little bit developed, but were amazing Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a dark, emotional, and funny entry in the series. 8/10"

He still has Ron and Hermoine to look up to, but it is no more fun and games. The movie however, was. Impressive special effects and groundbreaking sequences events, turn this into one of the most intense films of the entire franchise.

A big fan of the written series and bigger fan of the Azkaban film I felt confused and a bit cheated when watching HBP. The trailers were edited to be much more engaging than the film turned out to be, the acting/dialog seemed off balance compared to previous stints turned in by all parties, and the unbelievable reconstruction of the action on the tower were mind-blowingly inconsistent and disappointing.

Most of the acting seemed off, especially the age of the actors compared to the characters was incredibly offputting - Daniel Radcliff looks like she should have a mortgage and a kid or two but is playing a high school senior-aged kid. The CG was used in lame pastiches and at unnecessary moments and featured nothing particularly impressive or imaginative to look at.
