Do they have a right to exist? Absolutely. And as an avowed aesthetic relativist, I believe they're allowed to exist in whatever manner they'd like to. However, by that same token, that doesn't mean I have to like any of them. For me, the best movies that have anything to do with faith, end up either discussing it at a rather oblique angle or without a ton of specificity/esotericism (ala \"The Book Of Eli\" and \"The Green Mile,\" respectively). This is not that kind of movie.I'll say this -- there's at least a lot of passion behind \"Overcomer.\" However, none of it is intended for me or anyone like me. And it's honestly not as if I'm in any sort of cinematic minority here. It's a film crafted for a select, presumably small cluster of people; a class that I'm just not a part of. And that's fine. As long as it's fine that I say, in turn, that I feel this simply doesn't work. It's unfocused, overly earnest, sparsely well-acted, and almost chillingly out of touch. Again, if you enjoy on-the-nose entertainment like this, that's fine. I just don't. Simple as that."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "My wife and I attended this movie.  We've made it a point to catch all the Kendrick Brothers movies, and any Christian films we catch on our radar.  Overall, I found the characters in this film to be believable, struggling people who want to do well, and think they are, even when they are not doing the right thing.  That would be described accurately as realistic. The situations portrayed are well thought out, timely (I'm from Buffalo, and grew up when the steel plans all shut-down, and feel the character's pain), and accurately portray how God works through people and events to \"get our attention\" and help us deal with an imperfect world.  The forgiveness portrayed in the movie is one that would be foreign, no, impossible to believe to anyone who does not know the Forgiveness we receive when we accept Christ's atoning sacrifice for our sin, accept his gift of Salvation, and understand that we are to forgive others as we have been forgiven (Matthew 7:1-5).  The best advice I have is to go and watch the movie.  If you have friends that are truly seeking forgiveness, take them with you (if money is an issue, offer to pay their way, remembering that Tuesdays are bargain days at participating Regal Cinemas if you're a Crown member).  This movie accurately portrays the forgiveness that Christ offers, and the response that we need to have as a result of that.  The Bonus is that this is good, clean, and yes, fun entertainment for any age."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "As usual, secular critics\u2019 heads explode whenever Christians are portrayed as anything other than narrow-minded bigots. The very things that make them angry or uncomfortable are the things that show these characters as authentic Christians - flawed, prayerful, forgiven and forgiving.  I know these characters. I grew up with these characters. And that\u2019s why they\u2019re believable."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Poorly lit and abysmal, this propaganda film is just as bad as the ones that came before it, and the ones that will come after."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Well done, inspiring movie. I shed a few tears because of poignant moments and very moving dialog. If you like cross country running, you will love this movie. If you don't like running, you will still love this movie. It's also about relationships, dealing with personal letdowns, knowing your identity, and forgiveness. The critics always downgrade Christian themed movies, so don't be discouraged. The two others who came to the movie with me also enjoyed it very much. Thank you Kendrick Brothers for a movie that is suitable and meaningful for the whole family!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This movie was incredible.  My 8 year old and 10 year old loves it too.

Every bad Christisn movie cliche imaginable. White savior complex. Stunningly poor acting. Amateurish writing (if I want to be preached at, I'll find a church). Even bad lighting and cinematography.

They hated this movie. On the other hand the audience of real people I saw it with LOVED IT.  And before you accuse me of being a Jesus zealot I happen to be Hebrew.  The movie was great and inspirational.  I'm not ashamed to admit that certain scenes moved me to tears.  Great family entertainment.  Go see it."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "What an absolutely beautiful film! Great acting and excellent story line. It is sad to see so much hate toward the Creator these last days. If this film was based on a lie, it would have received great reviews, but being based on Truth, it is automatically despised, even by people that clearly did not watch it. Every breath we take and every beat of our heart is a gift from the LORD Jesus and this movie clearly demonstrates His great and unfailing love toward us! There is not human ability to overcome death, Jesus the Christ alone has provided the only way!"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "With the exception of maybe Courageous, the films from the Kendrick brothers have been just as amateurish and pandering as the rest of the faith-based offerings. Receiving the same kind of repeated criticism for middling production values, stale dramatic beats, and the messages themselves. However, I've always felt that the duo have really pushed themselves with each successive release to try new things and make higher quality entertainment, which something the kind of thing these movies really need right now. I can't say the same about Overcomer though, as it feels like their first really phoned in effort to date.While it's obvious no one onscreen is really trying with their performances, the real problem with the movie is the script. There are some effectively emotional moments, but no real depth. That's because the Kendrick's never went the extra mile to flesh out any of the characters. Not even the titular \"overcomer\" herself played by Aryn Wright-Thompson, who is oddly sidelined for the first half of the movie and never actually explored even when her problems do finally take center stage despite this supposedly being her story. Instead they just pulled a bunch of the oldest tricks from the book on how to get the audience all sappy without having to put forth any real effort. It works, but is totally cheap and kind of insulting when you consider how intentionally lazy it feels.If I had to bet, I would say the Kendrick's decided to not give 100% to this one because they realized the hardcore evangelicals that have been keeping this genre afloat for years now without even a hint of constructive criticism were going to support it no matter what. Which highlights one of the biggest problems with Christian filmmaking. Why are the people behind these movies ever going to try and fix the flaws that now serve as an expected part of these experiences when they're going to be met with blind devotion no matter what? Call me crazy, but I think God deserves better from our onscreen attempts at worship so it's high time we the audience demanded improvement.Even Overcomer's religious element itself is a step from their earlier works. Where films like Courageous and War Room offered real world applications of faith to help with things in everyday life like marriage and parenting, this is a straight up Sunday school lesson on salvation. Don't really see how that's going to help those watching this as they are either already converted, or are going to be too angry with the mediocrity the Kendrick's served up here to pay attention to it.There is one thing they got right though, and that's the running. Cross country is the kind of sport that's hard to carry a movie on, and you can see that here. However, when the final race arrives it's just as big and powerful as any football or basketball match you'd see at the end of some other sports flick. As a runner myself, I can tell you that they did a wonderful job at capturing the mentality and strategy needed to compete for long distances like that. Something that alone made this a movie I genuinely enjoyed, despite what a disingenuous cash grab it is overall.5.5/10"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This movie is inspirational, humorous, and wonderful.
