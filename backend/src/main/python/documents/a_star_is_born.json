      "text": "I will not talk about the other films, regardless of whether this is the third remake of the same story.But I will talk about what I saw and what I really think this film is and first of all I must mention that the hype in my opinion was excessive.Bradley Cooper did good in his debut behind the scenes, but I don't think it's the wonder a lot of critics are saying it is. Regrettably, I think this film will actually get some nominations for the Academy Award and in my opinion it doesn't deserve them.This remake is as basic as it is predictable and no matter that we are in a story updated to our times all its elements feel too predictable. Regardless of whether you've seen the remakes or not, if you've seen romantic films in your life you know where the story is going and that takes away much of its charm.Cooper gives a sustained rhythm to the first hour. The music is pretty good, the concerts scenes are vibrant, everything unfolds in a pleasant, entertaining and interesting way but there comes a point where the rhythm begins to fall drastically and Cooper loses control of the story because when the drama and the emotional break arrives, he only stacks one event after another in order to provoke an emotional reaction from the viewers in order to prepare them for the final and huge dramatic point of the story.Yes, there's quality, that I will not deny it, Cooper delivers a sincere performance although in points it's kinda cliche. Lady Gaga does the same because she starts well but when the moment comes she only becomes a more fictional version of her real life stage persona. No surprise on that side.Bradley Cooper ends up offering a solid debut as a director but one too predictable and safe. It doesn't take any risk and everything walks from point A to point B by a very straight path and although functional, it doesn't offer anything new or refreshing."

More importantly, it's their love story is a beautiful combination of perfect chemistry and wonderful performances. Gaga is astounding with charisma and subtlety that's continually captivating. Of course, her singing (done live) is spectacular (the song's are strong too). This is probably Cooper's best performance, he lays out his character with magnetism and raw emotion. Being an accomplished actor pays off when it came to Cooper directing the film. Not only has he elicited poignant moments from every member of the cast (with lots of lingering closeups), he's skillfully created an appealing narrative (the strong script helps). My only complaint is that the ending, although sad, didn't move me. Otherwise, this film features 2 wonderfully-compelling performances in a truly touching love story."

      "text": "Cooper's painfully earnest depiction of a (very unlikeable and greasy-haired) addict is far too heavy for this frothy material. As one reviewer said, more 'A Star Goes Out' than 'A Star Is Born'. At least the self-indulgent focus on him spares us much of Gaga's precariously near-wooden acting. If Cooper was insistent on giving it the heavy-handed treatment he should have had the character's addiction stem from the pressures of fame and not from his family background. The resulting premise makes the music industry setting redundant. Subsequently, there is no palpable reason for tension between the leads, which makes for a very lacklustre experience. This might have been saved by a crackle of sexual chemistry but there is none. Cooper looks good without his shirt on but so what? Nobody wants to stare at those two weird faces for two and half hours. Some of the gruff-voiced dialogue is embarrassing (Sam Elliott, anyone?). Following in the unfortunate footsteps of 'Mother!' and 'Hereditary', it's unintentionally funny in parts and boring in others. The songs aren't bad but they're not in the same league as those from the 1976 version. Gaga's performance on the stage is, of course, good but not that good. She screeches out the songs from the beginning and consequently has nowhere to go for the denouement. Let's face it, she has about a quarter of Streisand's talent and none of the charisma. I can see the effort, but mediocre results. Next!"

GaGa was simply the wrong choice for Aly, an actual \"star\" like Brintey Spears would have fitted much better."

      "text": "Here, in his directorial debut, Bradley Cooper presents a third retelling of a timeless romance. It is said that each generation has their own version of A Star is Born; whether it\u2019s the 1937 original, Judy Garland\u2019s 1954 retelling or Barbra Streisand in 1976. This modern adaptation draws on that same arc of one star ascending whilst another falls, but it also feels very different; Cooper\u2019s film is a raw, affecting love story, perfect for the audiences of today.Cooper himself stars as Jackson Maine, grizzled and drug-addled country rocker, cruising through fame down the side street of self-destruction. The film opens in the midst of an immersive rock concert\u2026 before which we see Jack swig from a bottle and pop pills on the side of the stage. Soon enough, we meet the other half of our captivating double act, as Jack stops off at a drag bar only to find Lady Gaga\u2019s Ally performing a belting version of La Vie En Rose. He\u2019s instantly smitten both with her and her undeniable talent. What follows is a love story of highs and lows, as Ally\u2019s success blooms and Cooper\u2019s Jack spirals steadily into a pit of addiction. This film not only explores the personal struggles of a relationship, but the paralysing and enticing nature of fame.Bradley Cooper is transformative in his performance as Jackson; his gravelly tones and haggard gait make for a portrayal that is unrecognisably convincing. What is even more revolutionary, however, is Cooper\u2019s direction, an attentive approach to a story that deals with tough themes. Lady Gaga is a powerful force as Ally; we already know this megastar\u2019s ability to dominate a stage and deliver a vocal performance, but what is even more impressive is what we see of Ally when she is still a waitress too afraid to sing the songs she writes. Gaga\u2019s performance is a compelling one and the director in Cooper is brilliant at playing to her strengths; we learn to love Ally as she grows into herself, with the help of (but not dependency on) Jack. Ultimately, what makes A Star is Born a story worth retelling is its central romance; this film always rested entirely on that being believable. Gaga and Cooper\u2019s chemistry is simply wonderful; theirs is a real relationship, full of laughter, love and resentment. There\u2019s something so ineffable just in the way the characters look at eachother that makes their love so potent and only heightens the emotional effect of the tragedy that follows.Whilst Jack and Ally\u2019s relationship is the obvious focus, other characters stand in the background with Sam Elliott giving a beautifully understated performance as Jack\u2019s half-brother Bobby. The relationship between Jack and Bobby is superbly done; the screenwriters know never to allow it to take too much light but it still reaches an emotional payoff in one of the best scenes. In contrast, a manipulative triangle that forms between Jack, Ally and Rafi Gavron\u2019s hissable manager is one of the weaker aspects of the film, a little too cliched and rather stunted.There are also a few structural problems; throughout the second act, events in the story (from hastened wedding to SNL skits) stream too quickly by, yet the pace of Cooper\u2019s edit seems to drag. These are quickly resolved by the third act, however, where we are brought back to the lyrical pace of the first hour that works so well. The soundtrack leaves one slightly underwhelmed; whilst the film\u2019s booming anthem, \u2018Shallow\u2019 will stick with you for days, many of the songs lack much memorability with only a few really aiding the storytelling. You almost forget about the songs however in the many concert scenes; Matthew Libatique\u2019s cinematography is judicious, an engrossing shoot, from the bright neons of Ally\u2019s tour right through to Jackson\u2019s rock concerts which we see in the same drunken haze of their star. Outside of these moments too, the film is shot with a tenderness that also manages to feel totally involving.Early on in the film, Jackson wisely states the importance of having \u201csomething to say and a way to say it\u201d. This couldn\u2019t ring truer of A Star is Born; despite being a third remake, it\u2019s a retelling that feels like it was meant to be told. Two alluring lead performances and Cooper\u2019s deft direction make this film far from \u2018Shallow\u2019, but rather a deeply moving and dramatic love story that hits all the right notes"

      "text": "A star is born seems to be a humble film about the rise of a star and the simultaneous fall of another. This humility I think has been lost in the recent award season but whether or not this film deserves oscars or not, proably the former in my opinion, the film still has positives and negatives. Lady Gaga is a tremendous talent and excels as her role which she clealry has some emotional connection to. She delivers dialogue and emotions earnestly and is able to convey emotions proportional to on screen events. Lady Gaga only offers to lift this movie up with her unavoidable star presence.Bradley Cooper is a very likeable actor, he has had an accomplished career as an actor so far and his performances aren't always versatile but are consistently good. Here Bradley portarys a complex character with previous and existing issues. His acting of his characters' addiciton was more believable and effective in some scenes more so than others. He was at times overshadowed by his famous co-star but I do believe Bradley Cooper held his own and played a role that no one could easily have taken. His job as a director was solid, the directing didn't hinder the movie but its hard to think of any times where it excelled, which isn't too bad a criticism for a directorial debut, but I have seen better debuts by actors (Paul Dano's Wildlife).The soudtrack was really good, again an area where Lady Gaga came through. Bradley Cooper has to be commended for his contributions to this soundtrack however it is obvious his acting is where his comforts lie. The storyline was ok but it was obvious how this movie was going to progress. This movie tries to tackle difficult themes and for the most part it managed to do so effectively. However, I do think that certain issues, especially the one related to the conclusion of this movie was a bit awkward. The movie seems to be clunky in the sense that half way into the movie they realise they need to start preparing for how its going to end. This results in a drastic change in mood that whilst creates a feeling of dread in the audiene it also feels like an uncomfortable attempt to depress them also. This may have been the goal of the film but then again you could have shown a short film of histroical tragedies which would require little effort on behalf of the film maker to elicit the same feeling.  A more creative way to show the downfall of a perons life would have been more relatable and would have created a deeper feeling of sorrow in the audience rather than just a depressing afternoon."

      "text": "\"Far from the shallow,\" Gaga, Cooper and Libatique hit the right notes on this electrifying, gritty and down-to-earth journey to the stars.Being honest, it's my duty to acknowledge I haven't seen any of the previous three movies, my knowledge about them does not go beyond what I have had the pleasure of extracting from think pieces, interviews and critics' reviews. It's also my duty to acknowledge, due to the nature of this new movie, it's not a remake that gets inventiveness as greatest grip; Cooper's \"A Star Is Born\" does not conquer by raw innovation, but the suitability of the new takes and shifts that make it shines purposely with a force never seen before in the spate of remakes. Will Fetters, Eric Roth y Cooper, based on William Wellman' and Robert Carson's story, have updated the material with such commitment and passion that not only is the most poignant big-studio star-crossed-romances since \"La La Land\" or the most powerful feature film on music since \"Whiplash\" came out, both of them directed by Damien Chazelle, but is one of the most wide-ranging, honest-to-goodness and resounding inspections on addiction, vice, aspiration, celebrity, entertainment industry and sacrifice in Hollywood. The script creates its own leitmotifs with respect, improves some others, dragging them into a new stylized \"world\" looking to set up a perfectly paced melodrama with overwhelming rhythm, with chiaroscuros making this complex romance drama as painfully as inspiring; A dreamy-yet-grounded portrait of dreams and showbiz, one star is born, whereas another is flaming out.Characters are slightly shifted and/or refined likewise, not only more relatable and true to the running entertainment scene, but to today's audiences. Jackson Maine, inspired by American musician, multi-instrumentalist and singer-songwriter Eddie Vedder, is a country rocker star widely known for his musical talent, his old songs and his messy \"private\" life. Dipsomaniac, downhearted and unhappy \u2014 unless a guitar is present, \u2014 Jackson begins to catch the sense of dreams when he finds another person to make them come true; a way out that changes worlds, but not fates. Although his final decision could be debated forever, screenwriters are respectful to the original ending, making some fitting, enriching changes along the way, drawing a more holistic design for a man who feels his most beautiful song is gone.   In a feature film crowded with accolades and kudos, Matthew Libatique is the one who must take much of the praise. Skipping from L.A. to California, Libatique encapsulates a vibe of naturalness via pink sunsets, the illusion of natural lighting suffuses pictures of a dreamy spirit and the atmosphere of an annihilating stoicism and fluency. Director Darren Aronofsky's longtime collaborator converges lighting, control of form and vision with glorious prowess, the performance scenes shot at the Coachella and Glastonbury festivals and Saturday Night Live are organic and honest because of the fantastic camerawork, focusing entirely on the actors and impregnating intimacy and deprivation into Jackson and Ally's relationship.Set in a supposed present-day entertainment world, cameos as Halsey and Alec Baldwin are guarantees of veracity for this remake, allowing audiences to relate briskly with the atmosphere. Above the romance and drama, \"A Star Is Born\" is not a musical, is a film about music, therefore, this feature corresponds to and pushes forward the plot. The soundtrack isn't as catchy as \"La La Land\"'s iconic and fadeless compositions; however, Lady Gaga' and Bradley Cooper's \"Shallow\" is a shoo-in for Best Original Song, a global phenomenon, a hit aimed by a meaningful, intense live performance amid the film. \"A Star Is Born\" has enjoyed a rapturous reception by tracks like \"Always Remember Us This Way,\" \"Maybe It's Time and \"Look What I Found.\"A Star Is Born\" by Bradley Cooper goes beyond a drama piece of loss and pleasure, fame and failure, hate and love, self-acceptance and selfishness; a fable of showbiz creatures designed in recording studios directed unflinchingly by Cooper and stylized by Libatique's keen visual eye, a meditation on Gaga's career, who delivers one of the performances of the year, shakes the music and film world up at the same time and leaves the viewer a bittersweet feeling, mirroring the true nature of dreaming. This generation's \"A Star Is Born\" is a painful breakdown of the toxic excesses from success, a v\u00e9rit\u00e9-ish take on the false \"perfection\" of an artist's public persona, a grounded and raw commentary as for how music and entertainment industry works, a love letter to love itself, a downright unwavering and beautiful depiction of the little compatibility between dreams and relationships, a theatrical melodrama and, in the end, a vehicle of spiritual magnificence and emotional depth on what dreaming really involves: some stars are born as others just flame out."

      "text": "A Star is Born is an incredible directorial debut from Bradley Cooper, who also gives possibly the best performance of his career. Lady Gaga gives an incredible breakout performance that in my eyes, establishes her as one of Hollywood's A-List actresses. Her portrayal of a girl on the verge of stardom is incredibly honest, and her chemistry with Cooper is all at once cute, heartbreaking, and palpable. Cooper and Gaga give one of the best romantic performances I have seen in a while. Also in terms of performance, I want to give a special shout-out to Sam Elliot, who is in maybe 15 minutes of the movie, and absolutely steals every scene he is in.In terms of the direction, every shot is beautiful and vibrant, even in the lowest moments in the story. Also, from a story perspective, A Star is Born is a roller coaster of emotions. A Star is Born deftly crosses the huge scale and expanse of Ally and Jack's tumultuous relationship without ever losing sight of it's characters. This is no small feat when there are as many different scenes and locations all across the United States in this script! The music was very well written and well done, and Gaga's performances are the spotlight of the show. Bradley Cooper's musical moments honestly can hold their own too!A few minor flaws with A Star is Born hold it back from being a perfect 10 for me. One, is that I didn't believe Lady Gaga's character blew up as big and as quickly as is portrayed in the movie. However, the movie does have a \"music-video\" type quality to it, so this is easily forgiven. The bigger problem, without getting into too many spoilers, is that it ends way too quickly. However abrupt the ending, the last shot of the film is beautiful. This is a great, musical romantic drama that I will watch again and again."

      "text": "We all must use our best traits of excellence, as passion plus skill equals impact beyond the grave, sustaining the salt of the earth and the light of the world. True to the expectation of our existence, Bradley Cooper\u2019s directorial debut brings everything he excels at in updating the tragically romantic classic A Star is Born for the 21st century.Before seeing this movie, the horrible, mega cheesy trailer got me worried, I thought despite all the early Oscar attention, this might match The Greatest Showman\u2019s quality, thankfully I was wrong. In fact, beyond just making a dang enjoyable film, the three-time Academy Award nominee exploits his clear skill in acting, singing, and directing. Bradley enhances his reputation beyond just the sincere tear drips he controls, but also shows a grand soul at a small-scale production size that proves bigger is not always better, unless that bigger thing is the heart.This character of his that represents all of Arizona shares marvelous chemistry alongside Lady Gaga enough to deeply move her performance in a way that will inspire any women watching. The famous pop singer first croons down a dark alley to communicate pain whilst the memorable title card comes up, then tops it off with a heavy-hitting finale she put her entire self into. It\u2019s honestly such a joy to see the similar journey these two love-birds go through, even proving how a conversation about some random bag of frozen peas goes a long way.Almost the rest of the whole cast puts their best foot forward, including the briefly present comedian Dave Chappelle, whose realistic speech further justifies our care about the main couple. That doesn\u2019t include everyone though, as Rafi Gavron proves unoriginality on the screen he ought to avoid from here on out. This \u201cactor\u201d plays a British guy who serves an antagonistic force with an accent that suggests slight racism. Along with its misrepresentation of those from the UK, there is also a missed opportunity for Mexican representation, considering its Southern US setting, to make this reflect more close-to-home our culture nowadays; look at No Country for Old Men to see Mexicans portrayed in a much timelier fashion.Although Americans are represented terrifically, as their culture is shown through all the small moments. Much like the mass obsession of appearance, Lady Gaga\u2019s big nose is emphasized, which her character thinks roadblocks her road to fame. Then once her pain is justified, Gaga\u2019s singing no longer sounds 100% pitch perfect, as her voice often cracks as she belts in front of the crowd. Normally, this would prove unprofessionalism, but in this case, our given perspective enables insight on her vulnerability as a growing celebrity. Then away from the spotlight, cute memories are lingered on between the two: peeling off artificial eyebrows, smearing pie on face, moments that naturally trigger laughter with sincerity surpassed beyond any West Side Story duet.Yet not every moment helps refine the final product, for editor Jay Cassidy (Into the Wild, Silver Linings Playbook) rushes things carelessly to lay out little time passage around some life milestones that come off as ineffective. One unimportant component lingered on includes the usage of old people for the comic relief of misunderstanding technology, which really should have been cut entirely to help the obtrusive scene-to-scene transitions not feel cut too short.Essentially, it just means this movie has a mind on featuring the world of fame with insurmountable depth. Instead of brash outfits, the costume designer Erin Benach (Drive, The Neon Demon) clearly understands how color complements human form. For instance, Lady Gaga at one point dyes her hair bright ginger, a rags-to-riches transition Benach accommodates to without being over-the-top lavish. Especially when inside the bathroom, the wardrobe remains quiet enough to even make Gaga\u2019s stark work uniform resemble a limiting straitjacket before meeting her beau. The costumes never call attention to themselves, as the noise depicted by the massive shaky-cam is relied upon instead to bulge out the true emotions. In any other project, this technique would come off as amateurish, but here, it helps authenticate every performance, especially when the energetic stage lights illuminate the steam to represent self-expression, achieving whatever 1980s feature-length music videos (Dirty Dancing for instance) attempted.Yes, A Star is Born is seriously worth glowing on about, even though everything beforehand worked against me having a good time; my ticket was paid out of pocket since MoviePass went flat-out faulty on a night the theater was so packed I had to sit third row from the screen. Yet miraculously, this piece of entertainment, like the passion in superb gifts, left an ultimate impact that knows how to salt the earth and enlighten the world with others who hope to do great."

I suppose Lady Gaga surprises people and she did better than I expected, but that doesn't make this a great movie. It's- okay. The chemistry between the two is great. However the plot is boring, the movie feels and is long as you know where the story is going, and that's it. I am not saying it's terrible, and probably a good starter for Cooper, but- it's just not that engaging, surprising or interesting."

From the script, to the movie, the acting, the music, the message and the chemistry is first rate!"

      "text": "Absurdly over-rated and ridiculously praised as a must by the jackass critics herd, media dunces, and the react as they're told audience now, it drags from beginning to end in a clich\u00e9 laden remake story with the major debut by Gaga coming off like acting class as you watch her trying to act (with good acting you don't notice).  Bradley is a very good actor, but he plays a contrived character with the put on voice only distracting.  The singing and music are great, but it doesn't make a movie.  The whole thing despite decent competent filmmaking rings false, going through the motions only.  Staged.Consider a movie with similar subject, \"Crazy Heart\", a far superior experience that got Jeff Bridges his Oscar (deservedly) but had no such hype because it was a small release without the benefit of huge pop diva presence.  That one got to you, more subtly maybe but it had a soul.  Bridges was the character.  This is a watch check flick."

This version is better than Streisand's but not as good as Garland's."

One of the odd scenes was his band cranking up with wailing electric guitars and you thought it was going to take off with some hard rock song.  Then Cooper started singing a ballad.  And Gaga didn't impress with her acting or her singing.  This movie was way overrated."
