My problem is with the emotional translation of the expectation.The Clone Wars was a good movie. If you are 8-12 years old. At 35, I was able to enjoy it for what it was: a good kids movie set in the Star Wars universe.What are these other reviewers wanting? I was 5 when Star Wars came out. 8 when Empire came out. 11 when Return came out. Most people who now claim to have been Star Wars fanatics fell right around the same age. This meant, at the peak of our hysteria, we were around 8. We thought (and still do) Empire was the best movie. And it is.We were 8.We wouldn't have, for a minute, been able to appreciate the dialogue of Pulp Fiction, the directing of Out of Africa, the story of Avalon or the acting in Glengarry Glen Ross.We were 8.So...I took my 8 year old to see The Clone Wars. And he was entranced. The action, the humor, the battles, Ritto the huttlett. Everything I've read as a complaint to this movie.You know why? Because it was made for an 8 year old.So was the original Star Wars trilogy.Hey...my generation. Stop criticizing George Lucas for making movies for kids. It's what he did from the minute he made Star Wars until the day he gave into the mid-30's fanboy and created Revenge of the Sith. He enjoys it. That's why he made another Indiana Jones. It's why he can't stop making Star Wars things. HE LIKES IT. He does a great job appealing to that age. And the kids love it.You aren't going to get the amazement of an 8 year old out of these movies while critiquing it with the intellect of a 36 year old. So stop trying.If you have young kids who love Star Wars, take them to see it. Show George that there is a reason to keep making these things.

Where did all this go wrong? My guess is that George Lucas wanted to extend the lifespan of Star Wars merchandising by making a new Star Wars movie made up of the first 3 or 4 episodes The Clone Wars TV series, only to expand on the merchandising when the series came out.\r This is not Star Wars. This is Star Wars: The Bored Wars. The battles are not exciting or engaging; they are the most formulaic thing in the film, and there is nothing much to add aside from how poorly edited this movie really was. Hell, the episodes, if they were kept in their original forms, would probably be just as bad as before even without the clumsy sandwiching they used to put them together in one under-produced film."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "not a terrible movie, but its just wasn't good enough. the animation was kind of cheesy and the storyline was kind of messed up, but the acting wasn't that bad and the visual effects were very good.

Youd have to be really young, or a very accepting star wars fan to get any enjoyment out of this. it does have good lightsaber duels, and its awesome to see more backstory on jedi in the council, but they executed the story in a completely wrong way, and the animation comes off as very kiddy as well. im not a huge star wars fan anymore, as ive basically grown out of it, and while i do still consider myself a starwars fan, and i do look foward to seeing 7, 8, and 9 in the theaters, this entire movie and animated series im just going to pretend didnt happen. this score is completely opinion based, but i stand by my opinions, and the opinions of many others, on this movie and even the tv series. good seeing jedi and great action scenes, but a story that doesnt fit and all together seems completely unneccessary, which makes it hard to get into."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "A disaster movie made \u200b\u200bonly for those who saw the bad set of 'Star Wars: The Clone Wars'. The movie is terrible."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "When I was sitting in a theater during the summer of 1977 enthralled by the spectacle that was Star Wars, never did I imagine that, some 31 years later, I would find myself wishing it would go away. Overmerchandising, fan unfriendliness, and greed have sapped all that was magical about the Star Wars name. The Clone Wars, as obvious a money-grab as there has ever been, stands alongside the infamous 1978 Star Wars Holiday Special as officially sanctioned productions that are better ignored or forgotten. The Clone Wars is the last nail in a coffin that has been propped up ever since George Lucas sold his creative soul in the quest for a few more pieces of gold.\r It has been 25 years since the Star Wars saga has moved forward. In that time, we have gotten three movies' worth of back story, but there really hasn't been anything new. The prequels work well enough in the overall picture of things, but there's something a little underwhelming about watching the pieces fall into places where one knows they'll end up. The tragedy of Anakin's fall is less compelling because we know what will happen to him after that fall. Now, with the latest cinematic installment of Star Wars, does Lucas finally give us something new? No. He returns to the time period of the prequels (specifically, the gap between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith) and gives us more back story. Only this time, we know the specific fates of all the characters. It's hard to imagine a more pointless endeavor.\r To add insult to injury, this isn't even a live-action episode. It's animated. In fact, the movie is really the pilot for a TV series and looks about as stilted as one might expect from something with that pedigree. This isn't quality computer generated animation, it's cut rate stuff. It might look okay on a television but, blown up on the big screen, it looks cheesy. The space ships and droids are okay, but the humans have the appearance of old-time Christmas tree ornaments. The Star Wars action figures have more personality. Then there are the voices. Most of the actors declined invitations to provide their vocal talents, so we have a group of unfamiliar actors giving voice to the animated likenesses of Anakin, Obi-Wan, Yoda, and Padme. Only Samuel L. Jackson (as Mace Windu), Anthony Daniels (as C3PO), and Christopher Lee (as Count Dooku) provide a tenuous link to things past. (This gives Daniels the distinction of being the only actor to have participated in all seven Star Wars motion pictures.)\r The Clone Wars is a good example of how action can be boring. Roughly 50% of the movie features droids and clone troopers blasting each other. Repetitive doesn't even begin to cover it. A lot of the other stuff is anti-climactic. For example, there's a lightsaber duel between Anakin and Count Dooku, but since we've already seen the final confrontation between the two in Revenge of the Sith, this feels more than a little unnecessary. From the moment it begins, we know it's destined to end in a stalemate, so what's the point?\r Throughout the six live action films, Lucas created a number of memorable sidekick characters - some successful, some not so successful. C3PO and R2D2 rank at the top of the former category, and are viewed by many as the most endearing inhabitants of the Star Wars universe. Then there's Jar Jar Binks, and the less said about him, the better. (To his credit, Lucas heeded the negative feedback and phased Jar Jar out of the series after The Phantom Menace.) The Clone Wars gives us Ashoka Tano, a bratty teenage girl who is nearly an annoying as Jar Jar, but without the accent. Since she's nowhere to be found by the time we get to Revenge of the Sith, one must assume she's not going to make it through the TV series. Sadly, her demise does not occur at any time during The Clone Wars.\r There's just enough of John Williams' main title to trick us into momentarily believing this is a true Star Wars movie, but even that has been re-mixed so it doesn't sound quite right. The incidental music is adequate but, considering what we have come to expect from the Star Wars features, it sounds pedestrian. It's another example of how much the entire project feels like a cheap knock-off - an attempt to prey on whatever little good will still exists in Star Wars fandom. Judging by the surprisingly sparse audience at the \"free\" promotional screening, however, there's not much enthusiasm out there for The Clone Wars. Gatherings for pre-release screenings of Revenge of the Sith were madhouses, with lines circling blocks. There were rows of empty seats for The Clone Wars. This surely won't be the last time Lucas attempts to wring blood from his Star Wars stone, but perhaps this golden egg is hard-boiled."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Yes, a little fan of Star Wars, with high expectations from Phantom, astonishingly surprised myself with a cheesy cornstock of complete patheticness (ignore the horrible spelling grammar). My expectations for the Star Wars tirlogy from Attack of the Clones, to Revenge got much lower. The second one was good, but the third had corny lines and bad acting (Hayden Christenson, razzi winner, mind you). I see a trailer in the cinemas while watching Get Smart on Aug. 1, and I see an animated Star Wars thing on the big screen. First of all, you can tell the script is awful by the cheesy lines they added in the teaser and theatrical. But then I randomly saw it, judging most aspects of the film to see how bad it really was after all. The special screening was interesting, and goodness, when this crap comes out in the cinemas, people will avoid it. Lioke seriously, what's the point of adding a remake of Revenge of the Sith, by changing almost everything around. It was very confusing. I don't know what Lucas was thinking while making this, but I think he's either on meth, or he's expecting to lose his career and laugh while people are watching him fail at his life -mostly taking back the reason why he won a life achievement award. But what a huge downfall in his career.

All the while the creators are raking in the money for the movie while simultaneously getting people pumped for the new TV show. As for the movie itself it's not that bad, it may only please the younger Star Wars fans, but older fans can get into it if they keep an open mind. It's basically just one battle scene after another with a simple plot behind it, and even adds some lightsaber duels and some touches of humor here and there, and does a good job of introducing a few of the new characters that you will be seeing in the TV show.
