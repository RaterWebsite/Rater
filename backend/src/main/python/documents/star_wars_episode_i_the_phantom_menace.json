Nothing good. The aesthetics of the characters is there, certainly, but every decision made is lacking precision and second, third, and fourth thoughts in its execution. Jar Jar Binks is supposed to appeal to the younger audiences, but was taken too far and became a caricature that only annoyed most. Darth Maul is a villain with with a ton of potential...but then is killed off without any further character development. These decisions, clearly, were based on merchandising statistics vs great storytelling motivations. A kid-friendly character sells better as a stuffed animal/pillow case than a villain, right? Add to this dialogue that is incredibly difficult to penetrate and understand for an audience member that is supposed to be driving the plot forward. Add to this dialogue that is really cliche and dumb that is supposed to entertain the kids. Total loss of tone in the story."

To alot of people it's too boring and childish, but I think it's good for what it is - an adventure movie for kids with deeper themes that adults and star wars nerds can ejoy too.

Darth Maul is cool no doubt, but his now iconic battle with that great music score, is not gripping since nothing is going on besides the fight. No drama, no character connections, just there for the spectacle. Just like the speeder race, which made a decent video game, but very dull to watch. Jar Jar Binks is yes beyond annoying, Natalie Portman's weird voice in this is well just weird. The story makes no sense and is not engaging at all. Nowadays your better off watching the Darth Maul battle clips, other than that I can't recommend you take the time to watch this film beginning to end."

Empty dialogue and stilted direction lead to bad performances from actors who are typically very good, and heavy use of CGI in its infancy has result in the film aging poorly.

People have often criticised the dialogue as 'wooden' but I think George did a great job extinguishing it from the previous entries. Boasting an excellent soundtrack and iconic battle between Darth Maul, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Only cons I can say about this movie would the heavy feature of Jar-Jar in it, though I don't mind the character, felt a bit too much at times. The podrace always dragged on a bit and was a bit of bore. Despite that, Phantom Menace will always remain a classic and mainstay on my shelf as the years go by."

The pacing was painfully slow, and even Liam Neeson seems bored. Then of course, there's the character of Jar Jar Binks, one of the most annoying characters in the history of cinema. Seriously, who thought HE was a good idea? Darth Maul was a cool villain, but he's barely even in it! The character development is practically non-existent, and much of the film is just a bunch of Jedi sitting around talking about taxation. The special effects were great, but the filmmakers seem to value them over story and characters. And just so you know, I am a HUGE Star Wars nerd. That's why this movie feels like a punch to the gut. FINAL VERDICT: This is a disappointing addition to a great franchise, and lacks the depth of previous instalments. 4.5/10."

      "text": "The actors are wallpaper, the jokes are juvenile, there's no romance, and the dialogue lands with the thud of a computer-instruction manual. But it's useless to criticize the visual astonishment that is Star Wars \u2013 Episode I: The Phantom Menace. With this epic and the trilogy that preceded it, George Lucas has built a pop-culture monument that packs all of history \u2013 war, religion, myth, art, science and those old reliables, good and evil \u2013 into a mystical grab bag that plays like a kiddie cartoon. There's a less fancy explanation for why Phantom Menace will inspire fetishistic worship: It's loaded with cool stuff. And reasonable facsimiles thereof are on sale at your local Force emporium.\r Episode I is set thirty years earlier than the original saga, Episode IV: A New Hope, but some things never change. A royal babe is in trouble. Not Princess Leia; this time it's Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman). The Trade Federation sends battleships to her planet, Naboo, to persuade her to sign a dodgy treaty. To her rescue come two Jedi knights: old pro Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). You'll recall that Alec Guinness played Obi-Wan the first time, and McGregor does a deft job of matching up with him vocally. ^Vhen Federation types send in droids for the kill, the Jedis link up with Anakin Sky walker (Jake Lloyd), a nine-year-old slave who will grow up to marry the queen, father the twins Luke and Leia, and turn from the Jedi cause to the dark side as Darth Vader. Got that?\r Good; here's what else you should know: Phantom Menace, which cost $115 million, lacks the crude freshness that Lucas lavished on the low-budget ($10 million) original in 1977 and the fluid storytelling that director Irvin Kershner brought to The Empire Strikes Back in 1980 \u2013 still the best in the series. But Menace is light-years ahead of the uneasy mix of furry Ewoks and Freudian psychology in Richard Marquand's 1983 Return of the Jedi. As for Lucas' directing skills, his work with actors still belongs to the \"Don't emote, just stand there\" school. But in terms of visual sophistication, already discernible in 1973's American Graffiti, Lucas ranks with the masters. He has always been more articulate with images than with words. Harrison Ford, who played Han Solo in the original, has famously chided Lucas, \"You can type this **** George, but you sure can't say it.\"\r McGregor is saddled with lines like, \"I have a bad feeling about this.\" And Neeson must answer, \"Be mindful of the living Force, my young Padawan.\" Ouch! Is it a coincidence that Phantom Menace and James Cameron's Titanic \u2013 whose box-office record ($1.8 billion worldwide) Lucas is chasing \u2013 were made by men with a poet's eyes and tin ears?\r Comic relief \u2013 and, boy, does this movie need it \u2013 arrives with scene-stealer Jar Jar Binks, a gangly, floppy-eared Gungan, voiced hilariously by Ahmed Best but otherwise a fully digital creation. Jar Jar is an alien amphibian who lives in an underwater city and speaks in a pidgin English that still gets the point across. \"Mesa in bombad troubles,\" says Jar Jar as he nabs food off plates with his long tongue and guides the Jedis in a submarine that gets chewed by a killer fish. Digital marvels abound, along with appearances by old favorites such as Jabba the Hutt and Yoda, who leads the Jedi Council on the planet Cor-uscant, along with Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson). Lucas surpasses himself in the creature department. Jar Jar's nemesis, Boss Nass, is a wonderfully odious menace. And Watto, the slave driver, is a fat-slob fly who manages to levitate on tiny hummingbird wings.\r The human element is hard put to keep up. Neeson has a natural warmth but too few opportunities for humor. Portman, a beauty and a gifted actress at eighteen, is stuck with an underwritten character \u2013 at least Carrie Fisher was allowed to bring her verbal snap to Princess Leia. And McGregor, a live wire in Trainspotting and Velvet Goldmine, spends the film's first half trailing Qui-Gon like a lap dog. Happily, McGregor comes into his own in the final scenes, suggesting that the next two episodes, due in 2002 and 2005, will let him cut loose.\r For now, the human focus is on Anakin, and the demands of the role \u2013 a messiah and an anti-Christ \u2013 put undue pressure on Lloyd, who was eight at the time of filming. You will search Lloyd's face in vain for the Darth Vader to come or for the agony of a boy forced to leave behind his slave mother, Shmi (Pernilla August), to begin his Jedi training. Lloyd shines in the lighter scenes, especially when Anakin enters a Podrace so perilous that ordinary humans can't tolerate the speed. The race is pure exhilaration. \"Whoopee!\" yells Anakin. Indeed. In this virtual universe \u2013 the video game supreme \u2013 Lucas is the king.\r Still remains the most disappointing films of all time. It's rubbish."

From the lush and delectable beauty of Naboo to the vast and overwhelming city-planet of Coruscant, the environments are simply wonderful to behold. I simply don't understand why the use of CGI in the film is ridiculed as it is-CGI is something created by humans, just like animatronics-I don't believe CGI is \"less human\" than animatronics. The CGI enhances the visual quality of the environment and the characters that are CGI; this was what CGI was created to do, after all. The action sequences are amazing to behold, especially in the film's 20-minute climax; the pacing was perfect-the quick cuts between the three major conflicts matched the intense, fast-paced style of the battle-George Lucas' mastery in the visual arts was evident in the film. The symbolism and mythology-a Star Wars hallmark-is still a force to be reckoned with. Darth Maul's image, the duality in characters like Palpatine, and the symbiosis between prevalent organizations are all compelling, as well as the character types. Speaking of characters, I enjoyed Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, Padm\u00e9, and Anakin. I was interested by each of their journeys, and where they began and ended. I cared about them, as well; they weren't \"wooden\" and \"boring,\" and nor were the performances behind them. The writing was good-not written by a 5-year-old-Lucas kept me interested in the characters and the story. I liked the politics involved in the story, as I am very interested in politics. The pacing for the story was good, as well. The supposed \"plot-holes\" are easily explained and/or easily ignored, and are more like nit-picks than actual criticism. I realize the problems both certain fans and critics alike have with this film-I understand their criticisms, but, to me, they either hold no water, or aren't significant enough to undermine the film, as I see it. I thought at least some of Jar-Jar Binks' antics were funny; he didn't annoy me, and I'm willing to bet he didn't annoy most of the kids who watched the film. Not only was Jar-Jar a character for kids, but he represents a \"wise fool\" in the film. Additionally, I hope people realize that this film isn't \"universally hated;\" look at this site-62% of fans gave this film a 3.5/5, and 57% of critics, just 3 points under \"fresh\" status, gave the film a positive review. All in all, Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace is an excellent film, and a more than worthy beginning to the saga; if you haven't seen it already, it is at least worth watching once."
