It is well executed and the acting is great. Many of the comedic scenes are original and it is remains light throughout. However, it pains me to say I just did not find myself being immersed or laughing very often, perhaps it was too light for my taste. Even comedies have a level of tension, suspense, character development, intended to pull you in, be invested at what is at stake, but I did not feel that here so much."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Fairly funny film with really good acting but men acting like women is only funny for so long."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "A solid first third, a slow saggy second, and magnificent third reel. The cross-dressing comedy is a bit meh in the 21st century but the satire and heart is still relevant. Tony Curtis' comedy chops are great. Jack Lemmon hams it up as the role demands. Marilyn Monroe as \"Sugar\" is perfectly cast, and is a very likeable character."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Some people still say this is the greatest comedy ever made in Hollywood. Who am I to argue? Even after 45 years, it's still very funny and not the least bit dated. It is one of the true classics in the history of film.I know one thing: Marilyn Monroe never looked hotter!The film is a wonderful combination of comedy, action, suspense and romance with great old-time gangster scenes played out first in Chicago and then in Miami Beach. George Raft and Nehimiah Persoff are just great as gangsters.The stars, though, are Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis but you can also enjoy performances from famous known actors like Pat O'Brien and Joe E. Brown. The action scenes are in the beginning and end. In the middle, the bulk of the film, is the main story featuring comedy and romance. Lemmon has the best lines in the film and his facial expressions alone evoke lots of laughter.This film is so famous that there is no need going into detail, but for some younger person reading this, don't worry about this being an old-fashioned, boring black-and-white film your parents or grandparents liked but you would find boring. You'll have fun watching this, too, I guarantee it."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Omgosh...i am shocked how good this movie is. Its 2020 and this movie is NOT out dated at all. The acting and writing is so good, so natural. Jack Lemon is halarious, so many funny scenes....Tony Curtis is wonderful and he was HOT. The dancing scene he has with Joe e Brown was cracking me up i had to keep rewinding it to see it again. I hope younger generation watches this movie. Its incredible. Gotta say i dont love Merylin Monroe, she is over acting and just not believable. But who cares Jack Lemon is Brilliant!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Some Like It Hot can be attributed to an immortal film. It will be relevant in the future, time does not affect it in any way. It looks on one sigh, the plot is simple and light. Acting is great. Yes, the black and white picture even goes to the artistic style of the film, although in 1959 almost everyone was shot on color film. Great comedy about easy love."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Some Like It Hot. Funny men in dresses. A truly comedic classic in which everything is perfect. 20's Gangster vibes, amazing music and I Wanna Be Loved by You."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "refresh my memory..Some Like It HotThe comic sequences aren't just some hocus pocus but contains some concrete material that has witty humor and amusing characters that focuses on the crisp of it and not some lame one liners or double entandre. I.A.L. Diamond and Billy Wilder; the screen writers, adapted the raw concept smartly and projected it onto various conversations that draws out laughs; especially the \"train\" sequence. Billy Wilder's brilliant execution is the key that helps keeping it to the ground and practical despite of having some sketchy scenes in it. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are flat out hilarious in their parallel roles and are supported thoroughly by Marilyn Monroe. Some Like It Hot defines and preaches others on how to create such genre feature and that is by focusing onto its lead characters that should and does go in here the journey that is full of chaos and bold but still never leaves the fun out of it."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I watched this film at the age of 14-15, I liked it very much and wanted to watch it again and it was as nice as I remember.I think we laughed so much that almost everyone would be happy to watch this movie.Jack Lemmon fascinates you with his acting really he plays the role and makes us feel it was one of the best acting I've seenMy favorite and most laughing scene was the dance scene of jack lemmon and Joe E.Brown duo,is probably one of the best scenes in the history of cinema.would definitely recommend to everyone.wonderful movie a masterpiece.but of course there are some bad aspects of ridiculous scenes, but you don't wear them too much."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This is a classic comedy film which I admit I'd never seen before but I'm glad I did, as I found it very amusing, quirky and I was glad it wasn't choc full of toilet/sex related humour, like a lot of modern 'comedies' have (there are mild innuendos but nothing especially graphic). I liked the visual slapstick comedy element and I thought that the two main characters, Joe and Jerry played by Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon respectively, did well in playing their parts, trying to keep their proverbial head above water while a number of different issues arise.Its all quite harmless and entertaining, with a nice soundtrack for the time it was made I suppose. Its certainly an easy watch and with solid performances and quite a number of laughs, its well worth a watch."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Ridiculous plot, but very enjoyable nonetheless.'Some Like It Hot' is good, unserious fun. Tony Curtis (Joe) and Jack Lemmon (Jerry) are the stars of the show, with amusing performances from start-to-finish. Marilyn Monroe is pleasant too, this is actually the first film of Monroe's I've seen. A good'un!The pacing isn't perfect but that doesn't hamper things at all really. It's a bonkers 122 minutes, filled with entertaining shenanigans - the ending is particularly wacky. Don't think I would've liked it as well without Curtis & Lemmon, admittedly.Worth watching, without question."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Although not all the jokes have aged well its a funny film.
