I really saw an improvement here, from the mother of the worst, Twilight. I liked Red Riding Hood really much because it is quite interesting and unpredictable, but werewolves are monsters, not normal animals ms. Hardwicke, you should've worked on that and I could give it the 8 it could deserve (not saying the movie is bad) If they make a sequel, which I really doubt, I'm gonna be one to see it."

And to be honest, I walked into the theater a little bit nervous about what am I going to see, does it really suck so bad? But walked out with a smile. Everyone's got their own opinion, the critics say it is so bad, I say it's good.

That said, RRH is that 1 out of 10:  the Stinker...just a weird and stilted film that never finds its footing.  One of the funkier things about the movie is that it has the trappings of a period piece where you expect the characters to have at least a little bit of British accent, but they all end up talking like your standard modern American (with the exception of Gary Oldman who overacts--or maybe it just seems likes he overacts b/c the other actors barely are acting).  Visual, Design and Costumes were cool... especially RRH's deep red Hood/Cape contrasting with the cool colors.  Bottom Line:  Amanda Seyfried's beauty saves the movie from being a zero."

The dialog was horrible, the screen shots were jagged, the celebration reminded me of a village full of inbreed villagers set in Mardi Gras.  The villians were laughable as villians... the cruelty was over the top & seemed faked. The best part of the movie was when Gary Oldman died (I guess everyone is facing hard times in this economy)... as his character gave me a headache.\r I was actually on the side of the wolf... kill all the stupid, inbreeded town people... they bring the stupid curve to a whole new low. Amanda Seyfreid was the best thing in this movie (which believe me is not saying much) but her character shows no emotion & I had a tough time seeing the evil side that they tried to focus on. During the movie I actual googled the listing time to see how long I was required to be tortured by this movie... the 12 year olds l took w/ me liked it... but this movie - which had the making to be a cult classic fell so short of anything worth watching.\r I want my money or time back from this movie."

      "text": "From the maker of \"Thirteen\", the 2003 film that depicts the accelerated speed in which kids are growing up in today's society, now comes \"Red Riding Hood\", the latest retelling of the ancient faerie tale made famous by The Brothers Grimm(known as \"Rottkappchen\") that shows how young medieval wenches from yore were no chaste angels either. Billed as a reworking of the popular \"Twilight Saga\", the film's theme of a young girl's lost innocence aligns itself equally well with the Larry Clark-lite indie, since in the recent \"Eclipse\", Bella(Kristen Stewart) keeps her virginity, whereas Valerie(Amanda Seyfried) gives it away quite freely for a nineteenth century chick. Starring Evan Rachel Wood and Holly Hunter, \"Thirteen\" examines the ramifications of a mother who tries too hard to be her daughter's contemporary. In one scene, set at a high-end Melrose clothing boutique, Tracey emerges from the changing room outfitted in garb more suitable for a bar than middle school. Most mothers would throw a fit, but Melanie, a former flower child, wanting to be \"the hot big sister\" that Evie(Nikki Reed) labels her as, endorses the tight-fitting ensemble by remarking, \"You look incredible.\" In effect, encouraging her little girl to flaunt her wares around boys through coquettish behavior. Similarly, in \"Red Riding Hood\", Valerie, who had previously looked as if she were a Renaissance fair fashion victim, accepts the scintillating red cloak from her proto-hippie grandmother(Julie Christie), who all but encourages the young lass to dress provocatively and to engage in sexual activities by warning the newly-ordained Red Riding Hood to be \"careful\". She makes for an equally poor role model as Valerie's mother, who gave birth to a love child, her half-sister Lucy. Betrothed to a wealthy blacksmith, Valerie still possesses some unresolved feelings towards a lowly woodcutter, who should have been the original wolf instead of a red herring, since the final plot twist creates some unintended sexual tension among family members.  The red cloak, originally intended as a wedding present to be worn on the night she was supposed to consummate her nuptials with Henry(Max Irons), the sexually-charged garment instead is utilized as a means to seduce Peter(Shiloh Fernandez) in a premarital fling, thereby spoiling the girl's chances for gainful holy matrimony. Valerie ends up living in the forest as an outcast, cohabitating with an animal outside the sanctity of marriage."

This movie was a disaster and even though Amanda Seyfriend is in it, is not a good enough reason to rate it high. That is not a true review. She is a very limited range actress, and while has done a couple of good things, she really can't due dramatic roles with the depth they require. A really good actress can sometimes do something good with the character despite crappy writing and wierd animals flying around. I suppose it is young people who keep saying they like this crap and therefore will never get anything better..what a shame. Filmaking in the last decade has hit it's lowest point. The continual dumbing down of american youth. *sigh*.I'll stick to the older character and dialogue driven oldies. I don't need a lot of bells and whistles to keep my attention. I can have deep thoughts about a good plot and find entertainment in that, as always. I am so glad I was born in the 50's."

You wrong. Still the same type of movie as twilight. More romance than horror. I thought this movie was going be a horror film. THis movie has the same type of music that a twilight movie would have. Im kind of a twilight fan. I like twilight way more than this movie. I think that they might try to make another movie of this. If you like  Gothic movies than you will love this. A very bored and very entertaining Gothic Horror movie. More drama and romance than horror. This movie does has dip of horror. Just a little dip. The scary parts in the movie might be scary to only kids under 10. If you over ten it might not be scary to you. A great movie to see if you love Twilight. I think twilight fan is loving this movie.

The story is really not that complicated, even though at certain points you're always wondering, who is who, what's going on, and so on. Very well made, probably the fact that it doesn't follow the story which we loved when we were children, made the public not appreciate this film. Great acting, small flaws in the movie, but in my opinion, a film worth seeing. Amanda, an impressive actress, couldn't have chosen a better role, followed by a strong male cast, and of course a mystery to mix them all up. Some elements really represent a sort of childish game, but all in all I would suggest you watch this movie. Not something you will remember in the past years, but still, if you're a fan of this kind of genre you won't be disappointed. I love movies and I liked this one. I really don't know what's the reason for all the small graded reviews, it was not at all that bad, that someone would rate it 0, for example, but I guess some people just don't appreciate the effort put in movies, even though you don't really argue with tastes.

This is one of the movies that ended up being forgotten.The film's problem begins when director Catherine Hardwicke decided to try to reissue the huge success she achieved, years before, with the \"Twilight\" franchise, based on the timeless story of Little Red Riding Hood: nothing easier than making the innocent and disobedient girl from the classic story in a hot-blooded teenager who, against her family's will, lives a burning passion with a boy from the same village, a village we don't know where it is but is isolated in the middle of a dense forest where a werewolf lives. And we have the elements for a story that appeals to young people, full of action, fights, suspense and, of course, sexual appeals that just don't go any further because it's a film for young people.To talk about the cast, we first have to talk about something that usually bothers me a lot whenever I see a period film: the anachronistic errors. Assuming that cinema is a field of entertainment, I try to be reasonable with this, but I value a film that respects the past. There are mistakes that can be forgiven: the wrong kind of weapon, food that didn't exist at the time... but it's harder to forgive if the entire cast decides to behave like they're in the 21st century. Unfortunately, that's what happens here, and it adds to the bad material and the bad dialogues given to the characters.Amanda Seyfried is beautiful, and the film knows how to explore the attributes of the actress. However, she is a 21st century girl dressed in medieval clothes. Shiloh Fernandez and Max Irons don't even try to look medieval, and Lukas Haas could be anything but a priest. Even stranger is to see Gary Oldman give life to a hybrid character, who mixes a witch hunter and a fanatical inquisitor with a Catholic bishop, in purple robes and a pectoral cross, who only lacks the miter, the crosier and the cape! There are good actresses (Virginia Madsen, Julie Christie) with characters who are totally insipid and uninteresting. The inclusion of black actors is a sign of their racial integration, but the Middle Ages were not politically correct and nothing helps me to understand what they do in the middle of medieval Central Europe, retrograde and isolated from people coming from so far away. It was a casting mistake that the script doesn't even bother to explain. For what?It is in the technical aspects that the film finds some redeeming elements: the cinematography is truly good and makes good use of elements such as fire, the flickering candlelight, the shadows of a rustic house, a misty and gloomy forest environment. The sets and even the costumes fulfill their role well, even though the director's lack of concern with the chronology has given rise to a mixture of bad taste of medieval elements from various periods and different moments (remember that the Middle Ages lasted practically a thousand years). The action and fight scenes work and help to give the film some movement, they fit more into the context of the film than that brief attempt at a sex scene by Seyfried in the straw, which will only serve to keep the boys looking at her cleavage. The CGI, and especially the wolf, is somewhat disappointing and the soundtrack sucks."
