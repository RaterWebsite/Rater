Catherine Zeta-Jones is very good and overcomes the predictable material. Pleasant score. Patricia Clarkson is very capable in a supporting role. It jumps around abruptly from light comedy to heavy drama too often. overall it is a satisfying film."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This movie was wonderful.

This was like seeing a horse jump over a fence, clip its legs, land in the mud, only to have the trainer come out, break its neck and put it down with a wrench... all the potential in the world!

The worst movie of the year, I rather would watch Epic Movie."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "If I hadn't been with a friend, I would have walked out. Cliched script. No energy to the movie except making people move fast (and even when they did, you could practically hear the director saying \"pick up the pace, people\". All of the acting seemed mechanical. Absolutely NO chemistry between Eckhart and Zeta-Jones. This was a waste of my time and money!

This movie made me hope to get home to tantrums, spit-up and pre-teen angst. It was awful. Catherine Zeta-Jones has the personality of drywall. The only thing positive was Erin Eckhardt's likable character."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This movie is by far the best I've seen all year. Zoe is just so cute and Nick is so dear-hearted. Kudos to the director/producer/etc for making a film that didn't involve open sex for once. The romance was heartfelt and tender and perfect.
