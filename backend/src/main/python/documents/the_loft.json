      "text": "Everyone seems to hate this movie and I can kind of understand why but to me this was a cool, sexy, twisty and entertaining thriller. I do actually genuinely like this movie. The plot follows five married guys who invest in a loft so they can take their mistresses their and then one day they walk in and find a dead body and they must find out who did it. now none of these characters are necessarily likable but the performances behind them are pretty good. Karl Urban is great as per-usual, James Marsden is a stand out and gives the best performance in the entire movie, Matthias Schoenaerts is also very good reprising his role from the Belgium film, Eric Stonestreet is serviceable to his role but not really all that good and Wentworth Miller is just plain awful and awkward in his role. Rachel Taylor is quite surprisingly good as one of the mistresses and Isabel Lucas is really hot (she sheds a lot of skin and it is kind of awesome) and has definitely improved on her acting skills. While the film is very confusing and takes a little too many twists here and there, I did enjoy the unraveling and the motives, it kept me guessing until the end. My biggest issue with the movie is its ending it just felt a little too nice for how dark and serious the movie is. In the end I found this to be a very entertaining movie that I would go back and watch again because of its ensemble and its fun plot. I know it has a 0% on rotten tomatoes and everyone seems to be hating it but I really like and  I give \"The Loft\" an A-. It is now in my list of guilty movie pleasures and underappreciated movies.\r Grade: A-\rRated R, 104 min. Open Road Films"

      "text": "I completely disagree with the American press. This movie is phenomenal! It\u2019s about 5 guys sharing a loft where they can bring their mistresses and eventually end up involved in an investigation that could land them all in jail. The movie has a very strong story that underlines the plot where it is going. This genre of erotic thriller is difficult in some parts of America. That is why the Belgian Director Erik Van Looy decided not to organize a press vision in advance. Perhaps he should just have done that given their pulverizing and ridicilous reviews. Apparently the American press has less difficulty with someone shooting forty men down than with five men who cheat!! The theme of premeditated adultery caused bad blood with the US press. That five adult males take a loft to jointly deceive their wives sometimes could shoot down the wrong way at the puritanical Americans, Van Looy had expected. But the press reviews are so over the top that they cannot be taken seriously because they prefer to pretend as if adultery does not exist. Just go look it up in theaters or bluray and decide for yourself!"

      "text": "\"The Loft got terrible reviews, it has a very rare 0% on Rotten Tomatoes so it interested me even more and i had to go watch it. So was it really that BAD?!? No it actually wasn't, at least for me. The acting is OK it's definitely not Oscar worthy and it's also not terrible. I thought Wentworth Miller was pretty decent, why people are calling him the worst actor in the movie is beyond me, if anything every actor was on par with each other. The film has so many plot twists and it gets annoying after a while, I could have done with one less twist. The way the story is told is in present tense as well as flashbacks between the present scenes and it's OK, but it could have been told better. There is some comedy relief mostly done by Eric Stonestreet also known as the fat guy from Modern Family. The movie had some potential but it kinda missed the mark, you wanna see how everything plays out but you also don't really care for any of the guys because they're all D-bags. Also I didn't buy that all 5 of them were friends. The movie would have been better had they added a thriller sense to it or just more suspense! I did enjoy it nonetheless, it did interest me and i honestly wasn't bored with it at all! Idk why critics tore this one apart, sometimes they just like doing that. If people can find enjoyment in movies like Tammy, Ouija and Transformers 4, why can't I somewhat enjoy this one ?! I'm giving The Loft a 6.5/10 it has its moments, but you're left thinking it could have been WAY better. Also I didn't like the ending. Is it worth watching at a theater? ehh, no not exactly. I don't regret it, but I also wouldn't say it's a must see at the theater lol. It's worth watching at least once, like a rental you'll either like it or not. I did like it but i know it had many flaws! I'll probably get it on bluray.\"\ufeff DON'T LISTEN TO CRITICS ON THIS ONE!"

      "text": "The film's mystery is obvious and predictable but there is a twist on top, the script is terrible the writer of the other remakes in 2008 and 2010  Bart De Pauw and  Wesley Strick script is laughable the romance is corny and their mystery is well done. You have talented actors so why are they in this film? It's the script that makes them terrible. We have two remakes that should not been made. The director of the original Erik Van Looy returns with more and more **** directing. The film gives us clues and good suspense the way we look at Karl Urban, James Marsden, Chris Vanowen, Wentworth Miller, Matthias Schoenaerts. The women in the film are terribly written; the film represents women as a whore of cliche's. But the film has a Hitchcock thriller and times it can be great it's gripping. Grade C+"

      "text": "Five married men enjoy sharing a beautiful apartment for their trysts, until a woman turns up handcuffed to the bed and dead. This is a classic whodunit with flashbacks to lay out the clues and every character having a motive. The plot keeps you guessing, but the suspicious glances, sometimes portentous dialogue and the director's stylistic flourishes get in the way of any tension. On the positive side, the movie's got an attractive, able cast and a high-end look. If you don't delve too deeply and appreciate this film as a crime puzzle you might enjoy trying to put the pieces together."

      "text": "Infidelity burns, friends might not be there to share the heat. The concept of having a getaway place to fornicate is enticing, if one is seriously considering such sexual mischief The Loft serves as a guide of what should not be done. Boasting good cast and decent drama thriller, the film has pretty interesting twists and turns. However, the use of multi-perspective in varied timelines is occasionally as messy as the portrayed adulterous acts.\r One woman is found dead in an apartment which turns out to be clandestine rendezvous point for five married men. The resulting roller-coaster ride takes the plot shifting constantly between past and present. It also chains together the individual story of each men, as well as their confessions with the police, resulting in many subplots. It's an ambitious undertaking, which the film is barely able to pull off.\r The film method of transition is choppy. Not to mention it needs to reveal important information just at the right time, so expect backtrack aplenty. With many characters to portray, the movie sometimes veers from the mystery and rehearses overly dramatic secret lovers or scheming friends premise. Fortunately, its layered narrative pays off with good plot twists along the way, even though the journey there can be exhausting.\r With good line up consisting Karl Urban, Wentworth Miller and James Marsden, the acting is decent. They do their best despite the characters beings sociopaths, pathological liars or immoral jerks at best. It's very hard to identify with them as they can be ridiculously conniving, near the level of obsession. Emotionally detached is an understatement.\r The Loft does have good cinematography and crisp design, so its visual matches the big screen, although somehow it reminds me of TV crime drama series. It offers a degree of entertainment with adequate suspense and thrill.\r A word to the wise: Best friends should never move in together, or share one apartment for promiscuous purpose."

      "text": "The Loft had so much potential with an interesting plot and a great cast ensemble but it ultimately failed to deliver the goods. I largely blame the director here. Erik Van Looy tried to do too many things and none of them really worked. The cinematic effects used came off as pretentious and unnecessary and the twists at the end felt out of character and unrealistic. Overall it had certain strengths like solid acting and decent character development but it was not a good movie."

      "text": "Let's talk about The Loft...god help me.\r The story to The Loft is about five unlikable friends turn a loft into their own extra-marital affair playground. But when a young woman if found murdered on the property, and the only five keys belong to each of the five men, the suspicions turns on each other.\r Just when I thought I had a lucky escape from January with the movies that came out, so far February has been a hard month for me, not because of home problems or other such dramas, no it's just bad movies after bad movies that came out and bite me on the ass. The Loft is nothing different, it sucks like the month of January and February dose.\r Now let's talk about the good things in this movie: If you and your friends where drunk one night and you all want a good time destroying and movie this is the one.\r Now for the bad and these a lot of bad: Every character in this movie is A: Unlikable. or B: A peace of **** to the human race, and I think it's both. Who got great actors here who in the past pulled off great performances, but in this movie they where truly awful in this movie. I bet right now they regret being in this movie, because this film makes them look bad has actors and character's.\r The writing has well is probably the worst I've seen so far this year. I mean my god nobody talks like this in real life. Aliens from out of space can write pretty dialogue than this if aliens ever came out in pace and joined a movie business.. if that even makes any sense at all, if it doesn't that's fine I have no idea what the hell I just said but I'm just going to keep it in to confuse people. So overall the writing in this was pathetically bad and I hope the writers never write anything else after seeing this.\r The movie drags on and on as well. I couple of times I kept guessing that the movie will end here or here or here, until at one point I already checked out before it finally reached to the end, that's how bored I was. Now in this worse than Mortdecai or Fifty Shades of Abuse? I can say no, those two films to me are much worse-er than The Loft. But on a positive side this movie can be best use when your friends around your house and there's nothing to watch, put this in and you can talk through out the film, it's okay I'm not going to tell you to be quiet, I will be talking too."

There are moments of real tension, a fair amount of humour, and the acting from the five leading men is very good. It's not the most cerebral film and it certainly doesn't merit or require repeated viewing, but there are some satisfying twists at the end and it is never boring."

BUT, in their haste to create a whodoneit with plenty of twists and turns, the  writers and directors forgot to create characters that had any depth. We don't know very much about any of them, and what we learn comes out in a mess of scattered flashbacks. The dialogue is stilted for the five guys involved and the wives are indistinguishable. I kept watching because I was curious, but it's not an engaging film.  Somewhere between  letting us know it's a murder mystery in the beginning and how the pieces fall together in the end, we don't get a very cohesive movie."
