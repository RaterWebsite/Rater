      "text": "(Mauro Lanari)The initial impact is deceptive: the \"Brokeback Mountain\" prequel? It is enough to give \"Cowboys\" just a few more minutes to change your mind and understand that we are faced with one of the increasingly sporadic cases in which indie cinema is still an added value, a crowd-pleaser movie that the Academy will never reward because it ostracizes this nonconformist type of cinema which instead is decisive to instill credibility and honest delicacy to the moving identity crisis of the 3 belonging to a family unit of a remote community on the border with Canada. Anna Kerrigan does not linger on events and concisely tells a story cleansed of any tinsel and imbued with an irresistible candor."
