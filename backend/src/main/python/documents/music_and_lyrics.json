      "text": "Best romantic comedy in years, avoiding the tired cliches that plague the genre. The self-mocking Grant, of his lame fame past is hilarious, and Barrymore is the most natural leading lady staring today. My wife and I loved it. One of those movies that I laughed about long after I left the theater. Only a hopeless cynic would not like this movie."

      "text": "Very cute. Ignore the many jokes that fall a bit flat, the cheap sets and Drew's neurotic Jew shtick and you're left with a sweet romance, Hugh Grant effortlessly carrying a film and most importantly the behind the music stuff. Very similar to That Thing You Do (obviously, since songs by Adam S.)---the music affectionately and effectively parodies different cheesy elements of pop...while at the same time infecting us with a love for the sounds."

      "text": "What screenwriting course, book or set of self-hypnosis tapes has writer-director Marc Lawrence been availing himself of lately? The man who brought us Miss Congeniality (a thoroughly mediocre script that was made watchable by an extremely engaging cast) and Two Weeks Notice (a desperate, laugh-free effort that even the cast didn't help) has made a 1000% quantum leap over his previous efforts, giving us an uncommonly smart, endearing and consistently funny romantic comedy that's also uncommonly perceptive about the American popular music industry, circa the 1980s and today. The MTV-video parody that opens the film is so delightful, well observed and absolutely spot-on that I was prepared to be let down by everything that followed, and I absolutely wasn't: this tale of how has-been Pop! singer Alex Fletcher (Hugh Grant channeling Andrew Ridgely, the half of Wham! that doubles as a Trivial Pursuit question) and a young woman, Sophie Ridgely (Drew Barrymore, intensifying all the crushes on her that currently exist and undoubtedly starting a few new ones) who's better at writing lyrics than watering plants, get together both professionally and personally is not only beautifully constructed in the manner of some of the best \"battle of the sexes\" comedies of the 1940s and 50s, but features endless bright dialogue, extremely catchy songs that are also accurate period pastiches, and--best of all--two flawed but intelligent, lovable human beings you really care about and root for. Nothing wrong with the supporting players, either: Brad Garrett, as Grant's sweetly resigned manager, rises from the ashes of his embarrassing work in The Pacifier to prove that there really is life after Everybody Loves Raymond, while Kristen Johnston, the rubber-faced Amazon from 3rd Rock from the Sun, is a comic marvel as Barrymore's giddy but wise older sister--the almost-throwaway sequence in which she tries to get her picture taken with Grant is a gem! Equally good, both in conception and interpretation, is Haley Bennett as Cora Corman, the flavor-of-the-month trillion-selling artist that Grant and Barrymore are writing for; Lawrence makes the very smart move of writing her as spoiled but not a brat. (She's predictably wrongheaded in some major ways, but that's because she's young and placed in the middle of an extraordinary situation she doesn't have the experience or wisdom to handle; unlike certain current pop stars we could name, she retains enough decency and common sense to assure us that she'll turn out fundamentally OK when she grows up.) The one common characteristic shared by romantic comedies and horror films (besides the fact that very few of either reach $100 million at the box office) is that in both genres you have to slog through a lot of dreck to find a good one: with every When Harry Met Sally... or Pretty Woman comes a dozen Must Love Dogs, Wedding Dates or Little Black Books. That's why it's so pleasantly surprising to come up with not one but two terrific ones in the last four months: the warm, uncommonly satisfying crowd-pleaser The Holiday and this. If my luck in other areas of life runs parallel to this, perhaps I'm doing the wrong thing at this moment. If you'll excuse me, I think I'm going to run out and buy a whole bunch of lottery tickets!"

      "text": "Being a guy who likes movies like Old School and Big Daddy, i was surprised to get a couple of genuine laughs out of this movie. However, since this IS supposed to be a chick flick, that may or may not be a good thing. I actually enjoyed this movie more than my friend (who is a girl). She DIDN'T like it because it wasn't chicky enough, and i liked it because it wasn't too chicky. So all in all, what i guess i'm trying to say, is that this movie doesn't really know what it's doing. Usually in romantic movies i still get that feeling at the end, that feeling that let's you know it's a sweet romantic movie. I didn't get this feeling from this one. In fact i didn't feel anything at all from this... so yeah it's basically just a throwaway film. If you wanna watch a chick flick, go watch The Holiday, and if you want something funny, go watch something funny."

Personally I didn't like most of the music, but that is sort of the type of music of today. The music that Grant and Barrymore compose is excellent. Nothing objectable in this movie, which is always a refreshing change."

      "text": "The movie begins with a hilariously cheesy 80s-style music video starring Hugh Grant, and then wavers between slightly humorous to forgettable and uninspired the rest of the way. Kristin tries to be funny as Barrymore's big sister, but she doesn't succeed. To top it off, I don't think the core \"song\" that Barrymore and Grant write is all that good to begin with--it's just decent. As in 8 Mile, That Thing You Do, Hustle and Flow, and other films focused on music and lyrics, the main melody needs to be catchy enough for viewers not to get bored. Also, I didn't really buy the romance between Grant and Barrymore, but they're as charming and adorable as you'd expect them to be."

      "text": "For those of you who wished \"Hustle and Flow\" was a romantic comedy, your movie has arrived. \"Music and Lyrics\" is surprisingly realistic in showing the creative process. Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore in their own ditzy way, pull off the same trick of muse contacting as Terrence Howard did in his breakthrough role; this modern-day Brill Building team convinces you that they're actually writing a song, in the moment, with flirty banter that really hits the mark. What Lester Bangs(Phillip Seymour-Hoffman) forecasted as an \"Industry of Cool\" in Cameron Crowe's \"Almost Famous\" and in his legendary essays is the timeline \"Music and Lyrics\" begins with, the inception of MTV(not named here) and its terrible byproduct; the triumph of style over substance. Although Pop bears a superficial resemblance to Wham, these fictitious eighties has-beens can't be Wham. Andrew Ridgley wasn't talented enough to have Alex Fletcher's fledgling career. Pop is more like Simon & Garfunkel reimagined as New Romantics. \"Music and Lyrics is a lot like the Crowe film in that it yearns for the recent past. The early-eighties isn't the late sixties(Haircut One Hundred, anybody?), but at least melody still took precedence over rhythm; best exemplified in \"Music and Lyrics\" when Cora Corman(an excellent Haley Bennett; her character is a perfect balance of innocence, and a self-assurance that vapidness is the new shrewd) thrashes a perfectly functional song you could perform at a karaoke bar."

Anyone who remembers MTV's beginning and danced through the 80s, will find countless ways to laugh at their past -- the style of dance, videos, hair, make-up and music are all spot-on and hilarious. Hugh Grant and Drew have good interaction. No big surprises as it is a romantic comedy, but good banter. Some of Hugh's one liners get a little hidden by his dry style, the quickly moving dialogue and Hugh's accent. I look forward to a second viewing on DVD. The biggest problem -- the Pop! song can get stuck in your head by the end of the movie and you may find yourself 'pop!'-ing in the car or at home."

And newcomer Haley Bennett was intriguing as the iconic pop diva. Fluff perhaps, but not empty fluff."
