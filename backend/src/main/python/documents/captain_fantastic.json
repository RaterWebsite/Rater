This unconventional family drama addresses a host of poignant issues (some flattering, some critical) on both ends of the social and ideological spectra, raising valid points for consideration and debate (one can only hope, though, that a currently polarized America will have the patience to take the time to listen to each side).

Always an excellent actor here he is even one step better than other times. Besides holding your attention in every scene he is in, including, yes, his required full frontal nudity shot, there are two short scenes that will mesmerize you with one being the screen filled with his full face from the chin up that expresses pain, hurt and puzzlement so distinctively you won\u2019t be able to miss what is going through his emotions. In the second scene, with his son, played by George Mackay, who should certainly get a supporting nomination, they are both so forceful in what they feel you won\u2019t breathe until the camera moves on to the next scene.\rThe story is a simple one of a couple who raise their 6 kids, ranging in ages from about 5-18, in the mountains and forests of the upper Northwest away from civilization. They are taught survival, are home schooled and in the evening they read, eat, play music and talk politics, philosophy and whatever else is on their mind. The opening scene is one of the oldest son becoming a \u2018man\u2019 by killing a deer for food, which, thankfully, is over quickly.\rTheir mother has been away for 3 months in the hospital for a bipolar condition and they are all shocked, including dad, when his sister, Kathryn Hahn, calls to tell him that their wife/mother had committed suicide. Though his father-in-law, Frank Langella, doesn\u2019t want him coming to the funeral he has all intentions of fulfilling his wife\u2019s Last Will and Testament and so he piles the kids into their school bus camper and takes them into the outside world.\r\u201cCaptain Fantastic\u201d is a roller coaster ride having you gasping by the deer, or other animal, killing followed by the laughing of the youngest asking \u201cWhat is sexual intercourse?\u201d or her older brother kissing a girl for the first time and then tears streaming down your face as you realize that as much as Ben loves his kids he may be hurting them more and could lose them.\rIn a cast of standouts, including all the kids and Steve Zahn along with Ann Dowd, the dominating figure is Viggo Mortensen followed closely by George MacKay\u2019s performance. Each of the kids have a chance to shine whether it is using the \u2018f\u2019 word, in a funny way, or a teenage girl discussing \u201cLolita\u201d and her feelings about the old man or a boy, not knowing how to deal with death, \u2018turning\u2019 on his father.\r\u201cCaptain Fantastic\u201d just misses being an excellent film due to a bad musical soundtrack, being a few minutes too long and turning to a \u2018Hollywood\u2019 ending which wasn\u2019t needed.\rThe film is rated R due to Mortensen\u2019s full frontal nudity, language, adult themes and talk, the latter mainly by the kids dealing with mature subjects.\rYears ago I said I would stop going to the movies if Charlize Theron didn\u2019t win the Oscar for \u201cMonster\u201d and at this point I feel the same way about Mortensen\u2019s performance!."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A very good adventure/drama movie about hippie outcasts.

This much buzzed about Sundance hit works on many levels, thanks mainly to Viggo Mortensen's charming and often times gripping performance, as well as the performances from the actors who played his six children. The film's story however felt a little uneven at times and unsure of where to go or what to say. Granted however, there were also many times where it had its fair share of both funny and heartbreaking moments.

Certainly there are many comical scenes which would make laugh even a calm person. But the movie raises a lot of problems, and it ask a viewer to make his/her own opinion - it does not have good or bad characters. Probably, a viewer would determine each character by themselves according to his/her own preferences and beliefs. All in all, actors play their characters very well - even the smaller children. It is also interesting, how some dialogues which do not have much sense in the first half of film receive their own resemblance in the events of the film later, obtaining a rather serious meaning, if you watch the film carefully, of course. It is not the movie to relax and at certain points it should make you sad or even cry, if you are sentimental one. But you should stay aware that this movie is not about its plot - its about showing the situation, around which script is written. You should not expect much of the development - you mostly get to know different sides of characters and obtaining your own opinion about them.\rI would suggst this movie to almost anyone, but not when you want to relax and ave a lil'bit o'laughter with a couple of friends.

Featuring a phenomenal leading turn from Viggo Mortensen, Captain Fantastic is a funny, charming, and moving little indie film from writer and director Matt Ross. A terrific calling card for future success, Ross has established himself as a man to watch with a nearly phenomenal work that is his most mainstream film to date. The entire cast is more than able in this little indie film about a man and his kids who live in the forests of the Pacific Northwest. An incredibly philosophical film about child rearing, acceptance, and balance, the film is incredibly well-written with its characters carrying a considerable amount of nuance. Nobody is all good and nobody is all bad, instead there is an incredible amount of things we will never understand about those we encounter. The film does a great job balancing these themes, while still telling a truly engaging story and building a world that we can really dive into and enjoy. Overall, Captain Fantastic is a sneaky little indie film that has flashes of brilliance, but its ending is a really let down."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I think this is one of the most inspiring movies in 2016. It talks about the problems today's society, from media to education. It brings up a strong argument. Everyone thinks kids should take today's standard education. And the movie highlights the point that an average kid today knows jack **** ****\rI do not imply home school is better than school but there is a major flaw in our current education systems.\rKids know nothing. They might know something but most important, we do not teach them to think. Kids don't do enough exercise, do not know how to survive, do not know discipline.\rI like the movie to put that education to that extreme, to bring up the controversy. It is that to start a discussion. I would argue if the character is smart enough to incorporate both his home school with actual school. It will be too perfect and end the discussion.\rWhat it brings out is if you teach your kids 'properly' i.e. to read, to think critically, to understand, there are a lot the kids can get from it (and the current education fails to deliver, the so call education experts can shut up, I do not care about your statistic, the fact is kids have a problem). However, it also demonstrates the other extreme of  home school which is the lack of social interaction. I think this movie should spark a discussion on our current education system.\rI believe in the state, people need to declare.\rI declare I am working in a university. Teaching final year undergraduate and I can tell you how many useless undergraduates have been award a certificate and pumped into the society.\rNo offence, even the best universities in the world, (e.g. Oxford, Cambridge, Yale or Harvard, etc).

It's used as a joke (how dumb this country is!) and as a way of courting empathy through the shared sense of superiority the audience has following this family as the protagonist. It's also outrageously unbelievable -- the kids all know like 6 languages, have read all great works of literature, play instruments, are up to date on all monthly periodicals and science magazines, oh right and outrageously fit and well-fed and know how to hunt and farm and THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME IN THE DAY! And the hypocrisy of their lifestyle going mostly unchallenged...But that's not really what this film is about. It's about dealing with grief in the best way you can, however that may be, other people's beliefs and their customs be damned. You're allowed to feel how you want and deal with it as you please.

The idea of raising your children in the nature, free from consumerism and having a healthy life is what every teenager dreams and claims to their friends, that he or she will do it in the future. The thing is that just like those dreams die when the person grows up, the story fades as the film goes by. It never became clear what concept the protagonist was trying to avoid: capitalism, consumerism, occidental culture; just was choosing a healthier life form; all those things or none. The plot was to light for a whole movie, with too many inconsistencies that make difficult its understanding.

You might even find yourself  saying \"right on\" at some of the lines. But people stop saying \"right on\" when...c. 1973-4?  And this movie is as dated as that for the same reasons. The counterculture isn't just over,  it almost seems quaint in today's harsher realities when good jobs are outsourced, employers who want to give their employees just enough to keep showing up, petroleum companies who spend their money on expensive print ads rather than actually doing the things they profess to do in the ads, ad nauseum. Sure.. all of the sentiments this family believe in are probably   more solid than  most of today's families..but so what? Who cares? And certain things about the film are almost laughably contrived...they travel in an old school bus(like the Merry Pranksters c. 1966) ...at a point of  giving up his  ideals, Mortenson CUTS HIS BEARD OFF, no I'm not kidding. The actually say \"stick it to the man\"..but who IS the man?  We knew that c.1967-1974 but who is the man now? The cops? The politicians? The main reason I saw this was the pretty good reviews and V. Mortensson's appearance. What  a waste..

So he wrote and directed this beautiful film. One of the best films of the years that should be in must see list. It was just like the film 'Alabama Moon', only the initial plot that extended for over the hundred minutes. The first thing is the cast, it was the best combination. Lots of future stars are here. It was more like a road movie, except in the opening few minutes.I did not like the entire film, I found a couple of things uncomfortable. Like the killing a deer in the opening scene and the end part. The conclusion was good, I thought it was the best solution for such a story, not for the theme. But then the final shot gave me an impression that they had got compromised. After all these years hard work, I felt they had given up. That did not stop me from enjoying it and recommending it to the others. Still, it is a very unique film that tried its best to avoid the usual clich\u00e9.This is the story of a father of six kids, raising them by his own outside the society in the wilderness. But the children are not left behind on the knowledge of the world, especially the philosophies theirs favourite topic. They are bright, as well as tough and can survive in any condition. One day when they get a message that their mother died, the journey begins to attend the funeral and during their way all the adventures are what we're going to witness.Due to the copyright issue the birthday song was altered. Surprisingly, the film was not based on any book. So my utmost appreciation goes to the creator of this wonderful product. Surely it will be a cult classic. It has lots of great dialogue, and bold revelations in a simple way about the facts of the world. Especially like related to the sex and other grown up stuffs clarifying the little kids' doubts.At some point I thought it was okay for the kids to watch with their parents, but it did not get better on that perspective. I mean having lots of main characters as children, the film is not good for their watch. Though the adults should not miss it, even though you are a religious person or any other kind.

Crian\u00e7as lendo sobre Marxismo e manifesto comunista s\u00e3o uma das coisas que vemos com frequ\u00eancia aqui. O filme, no inicio, nos d\u00e1 uma sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de uma propaganda socialista que \u00e9 totalmente desconstru\u00edda ao decorrer do filme. Vemos um tipo de sociedade estabelecia nesta pequena fam\u00edlia que funciona perfeitamente dentro de seus pr\u00f3prios padr\u00f5es. O roteiro trata com profundidade a rela\u00e7\u00e3o de irm\u00e3o para com irm\u00e3o e de pai para com filhos. Ben \u00e9 visto n\u00e3o somente como pai mas como capit\u00e3o, do qual as crian\u00e7as sentem enorme respeito.  Viggo Mortensen est\u00e1 em uma de suas melhores performances aqui.

Entre os filhos quem se destaca \u00e9 George McKay como Bo. McKay soube dar profundidade ao personagem que oscila entre parecer confiante e inteligente e completamente vulner\u00e1vel e inocente. Os dois personagens tem um dos melhores di\u00e1logos do filme, onde Bo finalmente diz o que est\u00e1 preso em sua garganta a muito tempo para seu pai.A dire\u00e7\u00e3o suave de Matt Ross acompanha o roteiro. Durante o filme temos v\u00e1rias cenas abertas nos enfatizando a natureza e nos oferecendo com profundidade o ambiente em que aqueles personagens vivem.

O filme nos proporciona um encontro perfeito entre dois mundos quando os personagens se deslocam de seu porto seguro para se aventurar no mundo considerado normal.  Ben e seus filhos parecem igualmente deslocados vivendo cercados por tudo aquilo que eles desprezam.  O filme tamb\u00e9m possui uma dose de humor negro que constantemente entra em contraste com a carga emocional que esses personagens carregam. Poucos filmes nos \u00faltimos anos trabalharam t\u00e3o bem a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre seres humanos como Captain Fantastic. Os ensinamentos filos\u00f3ficos de Ben para seus filhos nos inspira e o longa cumpre muito bem seu papel ao mostrar todos os lados de uma mesma situa\u00e7\u00e3o e aprofundar seus pr\u00f3prios questionamentos filos\u00f3ficos."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "You know a film is in trouble when you end up rooting for the wrong characters\u2014a fact made worse if you take into consideration the fact that the only semi-likable characters appear until the last third. But, not just that, \"Captain Fantastic\" comes of as a supremely hypocritical sermon whose main ingredients are arrogance and an unpleasant sort of cynicism. I'll admit, though, there are some moments of arresting anarchic beauty every now and then."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Oh, so that's how you get nominated, not once but twice by showing your dick for cinema.But in all seriousness, Viggo Mortensen was brilliant in this or just in anything he's in. Can't remember a time when he gave a bad performance."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "It is amazing how the film conveys the love of the family in the same way that the viewer clings to the film. Perhaps the main merit of the film is its clever script, which in addition to great fun, creates great dramatic scenes. But his effective direction, his beautiful cinematography and a great soundtrack make the movie something magical. It's a good drama, a good comedy, a good article of discussion. It is a human film and extremely well done, that surprises."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Sin relaci\u00f3n con el Captain Fantastic de Elton John, Viggo Mortensen fue la mejor opci\u00f3n para interpretar a un padre que hace lo mejor posible para demostrar que puede, a pesar de lo cuestionable de sus m\u00e9todos, cumplir con su compromiso. Una buena opci\u00f3n para celebrar el d\u00eda del padre."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Captain Fantastic is about a seemingly well-educated family raised in a life outside the typical civilized life led by their father. However, when they are faced with a tragic incident, they travel back into the city mostly unprepared for life there.\rThis is another great indie film worth checking out. It definitely shows its dedication to its conflict by showing the reactions of people in the city in response to something that the father does. Furthermore, the movie features great characters and a great story.\rWithout giving too much away, the ending just didn't work for me and I didn't feel as if it were earned. Also, it doesn't spend as much energy on its conflict as it thinks it is. With that aside, I recommend seeing this film, especially in this rather disappointing blockbuster season, and will grant it a seal of acknowledgement."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "A la mani\u00e8re d\u2019un Mosquito Coast, on suit dans cette chienlit de deux plombes le papa gaucho strict et s\u00e9v\u00e8re qui \u00e9l\u00e8ve en pleine nature sa smala de 6 m\u00f4mes\u2026 on dirait M\u00e9lenchon en Bolivie et sa vie de merde au milieu de nulle part, toujours en train de haranguer ses ouailles et de critiquer le \u00ab syst\u00e8me \u00bb\u2026Toutefois, sa femme \u00e9tant d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e, il faut bien aller aux fun\u00e9railles et se heurter aux r\u00e9alit\u00e9s du monde moderne ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 la belle-famille\u2026 et ceux-l\u00e0 ne portent pas forc\u00e9ment les m\u00e9thodes de l\u2019anarcho-gauchiste dans leur coeur !Mais qu\u2019importe, car papa mao a r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 tout sur l\u2019\u00e9ducation qu\u2019il prodigue \u00e0 sa descendance et ce, entre quelques s\u00e9ances de guimauve obligatoire particuli\u00e8rement assommantes (la m\u00f4man de la marmaille a clams\u00e9 -faut-il le rappeler- et en plus, elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 dingue).On s\u2019\u00e9tonne en tout cas qu\u2019il forme ses moutards au \u00ab close combat \u00bb entre deux lectures des Fr\u00e8res Karamazov, des d\u00e9lires de Noam Chomsky et de quelques essais sur la m\u00e9canique quantique) et qu\u2019il offre un couteau \u00ab Rambo \u00bb au plus jeune\u2026 (pour chasser le cerf sans doute) : ces \u00e9colos de mon cul restent donc de vrais Am\u00e9ricains apr\u00e8s tout, toujours la violence dans le sang !Ce ne sont \u00e9videmment pas les seules contradictions de ce foutoir \u00ab anti-tout \u00bb mais nous ne tenons pas \u00e0 nous \u00e9tendre plus que n\u00e9cessaire sur ce merdier d\u2019\u00e9colos-gauchiasses \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de leurs pompes : le p\u00e8re n\u2019est en d\u00e9finitive qu\u2019un gourou et ses enfants sont une mini-secte de trous du cul compl\u00e8tement perdus.

Must watch for every American family, young and old."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "I have to admit this is an emotional review, I mean it is more about the content than the esthetics or filming quality of the movie which I did appreciate. First of all, I have no kids but I think the homeschooling a very appealing concept hence my interest in watching this movie. But when you start a movie by killing and eating a reindeer, and the best gift the father gives the 6 years old kid is a pocket knife then you have the impression the message is not what you expected. I believe the director wanted to share a lot of messages, healthy food, minimalism, natural life and character development. But I found the movie full of forced cliches and too exaggerated which left me most of the time with mixed feelings. At the end the kids go to a normal school? Really? Like if there is no middle ground. Again it is a beautiful film to watch in terms of nature, but I got a very confusing message. Would not recommend to anyone question homeschooling unless you want to live in the forest."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "and in his place..Captain FantasticDespite of having a potential head start on its brilliant concept the feature relies upon the usual issues and properties of its genre and still surprisingly reaches to the place where the viewers may have been before but never experienced it like this before. Matt Ross's work is plausible as a director but its writing skills overpowers it and feels a bit unsatisfactory as it itself fails to justify it whilst projecting the anticipated vision on screen. The young actors are supporting convincingly but at the heart of it lies a genuinely moving performance carried off by Viggo Mortensen as a single parent trying to befriend and teach his kids. Captain Fantastic is aware of its eerie bubble created on script and hence spends its first half on setting the characters through it after which it shows its bright and poetic colours that paints this stunning craft."}], "recommendations": ["moonrise_kingdom", "the_florida_project", "the_big_sick", "wonder", "instant_family", "the_help", "freedom_writers", "the_perks_of_being_a_wallflower", "the_glass_castle", "up_in_the_air", "the_intern", "me_before_you", "3_idiots", "lady_bird", "fighting_with_my_family", "the_hunt", "stand_by_me_doraemon_2", "ingrid_goes_west", "manchester_by_the_sea", "the_hate_u_give", "silver_linings_playbook", "young_adult", "the_descendants", "okja", "collateral_beauty"]}
