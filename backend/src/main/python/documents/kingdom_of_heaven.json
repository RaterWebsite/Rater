The film seemed poorly edited and was missing something.  Then came the Directors Cut and it all made sense.  Americans were robbed of an excellent story once again due to low expectations on what the general public would like.  Whether or not his is true is another story all together.  What I feel is true is that the directors cut elevates the movie to something more than another action story.  It adds so much more to the dynamics of the characters, fleshing them out in much greater depth and detail, and providing more of a connection from one character to the next.  The stories protagonist, Balian (played by Orlando Bloom) is a mixture of several different personalities from the period, but his view of the world at the time could be considered very tolerant/progressive.  Bloom carries his role well, playing him as a reluctant \"hero\" who is more practical, preferring to rely on his mind as well as his fighting prowess.  He tends to fall in line more on how the ideal knight, sans the arrogance, would act if he actually defended his oaths.  He gets a lot of flack for this role for some reason, but I feel he fit very well.  The rest of the cast is very well thought out, with Eva Green skillfully playing the role of Sibylla as a strong, intelligent woman who understands all too well what must be done to maintain power.  Her character is probably one of the most tragic ones in the story, although the list of those is pretty long.  Jeremy Irons portrays the grizzled and cynical veteran Tiberias, who does some chewing of the scenery, but not in the bad way as far as I'm concerned.  His character is probably one of my favorites, as his expressions and manner of his delivery is perfect for his role.  There are very few characters that I did not appreciate in this one, but needless to say it would take up a lot more text.  Liam Neeson, Edward Norton, Marton Csokas all do excellent jobs in their roles as Balians father, King Baldwin IV, and the comic book villain that is Guy de Lusignan.  The three that stood out the most for me were Ghassan Massoud as a very honorable and respectful Salah'ad-din, Brendan Gleeson as the vicious but entertaining Raynald de Chatillon, and finally David Thewlis as the Zen-like Hospitaller.  Ridley Scott is one of my favorite directors of all time, and this movie definitely displays why.  This movie is awash in his trademark visual aesthetics (gorgeous color palettes, the ever present snow flakes fluttering about, etc), excellent writing, and some of the best music I have ever heard in a movie.  Any movie.  All in all he weaves together a very complex, but not entirely historically accurate, story between the second and third Crusades.  As much as the trailers would have you believe it, this is no action movie.  The pacing is good but sometimes on the slower side, and if you live for constant scenes of blood and violence, then you will be disappointed.  Kingdom of Heaven is a glimpse back in time through the eyes of Scott and Monahan and they did an amazing job."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "\"What man is a man if does not make the world better\"\r those signed words on the smithy touch my soul every time i watch this epic film.\ri regret i didnt go to watch it to the cinema, though in home still is a very good movie to watch.\rthe phography is beautiful, the cast is amazing, the dialogs are deep and well done. the action is intense in a very good way, you dont see favoritism for the muslims or the catholics.\rbalanced.\repic.\rAfter watching it i have learn what it takes to be a real knight."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "While Balian as a central character is under developed, Bloom did a fairly good job with what he had to work with. His rise to becoming a \"Perfect knight\" doesn't seem palpable enough, it would've been good to have seen him make a few mistakes, or perhaps take an action that has a consequence greater than he first anticipated. The themes running through the film are all good themes to work with, and the film definitely tries to analyse them, but it does take a couple of re-watches in order to figure them out completely, which I think is good. I gave The Dark Knight praise for doing that, so this gets praise too. The themes of Balian attempting to be an incorruptible knight seeking redemption for his sins (by committing none in the Holy Land) worked quite well, even though at times it seemed like he was sticking to his principles a bit too much. I think it was a good twist how Balian refuses to commit a little evil for the greater good by having Guy executed, however Seyblla, who is willing to commit a little evil for the greater good eventually dooms the kingdom by doing so. In a sense, they're two sides of the same coin.The film also highlights the other reasons why people went on Crusade. Its so universally believed now that the Crusades were just about religion and nothing else, as is the recent wars in the Middle East, that people forget about the commercial aspects of the Crusades. It's no secret that trade between Italy and the Crusader States helped to fester the Italian Renaissance by bringing massive wealth, and it was also no secret that Pope Urban who initiated the First Crusade, stated that the Holy Land was a land that \"floweth with milk and honey\". People were attracted to the Middle East because there was a great deal of riches there, and the film definitely brings out the fact that in the end, religion is just an overtone, while at the core, they're only fighting for betterment of themselves; something which Balian does not wish to do. In terms of cinematography, the movie is beautifully shot and edited, and highlights Ridley's signature big sweeping shots. The battle scenes are all well done and frighteningly realistic. The acting is also to be commended, mainly for Edward Norton, Jeremy Irons, the always great Liam Neeson, Alexander Siddig and Massoud (I really hope that's the right one), who portrayed Saladin.

First, the cinematography is great. The sets are also beautifully put together and they really chose a great location for filming this one, as it provided many beautiful images. In addition, the soundtrack was perfect. Often times, I do not notice a film's soundtrack, except when it was very good or very bad, and this one was great. Finally, the battle scenes were very well put together. They were certainly violent, but for the most part, beautifully filmed and choreographed.The acting was also solid, in particular from Edward Norton. He had a very small role, but had a really commanding presence here and killed it whenever he was speaking. Brendan Gleeson and Jeremy Irons were also very good here. Orlando Bloom and Eva Green were mostly good as well. Really, the only things holding this one back for me were the pace at times. While, for the most part, it was very interesting and moved at a steady pace, at times it slowed down to almost a crawl. If those could be picked up a bit, this one would be better. Another negative would be the script. At times, it was absolutely cringeworthy, at others it was serviceable, and at others it was pretty good.

Genuinely spectacular and historically quite respectable, Ridley Scott\u2019s latest epic is at its strongest in conveying the savagery spawned by fanaticism, as well as in creating a convincing view of a late 12th century when East and West co-existed, then came to blows for neither the first nor last time. Dramatically, however, there is a vaguely programmatic feel to the drastic upward mobility of a simple French blacksmith to the ruling echelon of the Latin Kingdom.\r The notion of basing a $140 million Hollywood production on the most calamitous episode in the joint history of the world\u2019s most dominant religions \u2014 and at a time like this, no less \u2014 would run the gamut from unlikely to sheerest folly in the minds of cautious industry execs.\r But Scott and screenwriter William Monahan have craftily solved most of the thorny problems by beginning their tale toward the end of the nearly century-long truce that followed the Crusaders\u2019 bloody conquest of Jerusalem in 1099; correctly pinning the lion\u2019s share of the blame for reigniting hostilities on a couple of rash Christian belligerents; making the Muslims look good in comparison by more thoroughly detailing Frankish deviltry and, perhaps most importantly, bestowing the most sympathetic characters with an anachronistic post-French Enlightenment humanistic attitude that, while not denying God, at least suggests a desire on their part to take an extended vacation from doing His fighting.\r In this respect, pic may irritate traditionalist Christians more than it will Muslims, who can delight not only in the ending, but in the hugely noble, if one-dimensional, portrait of the legendary warrior Saladin, strikingly impersonated by Syrian actor Ghassan Massoud.\r But once all the intricate historical needle-threading is said and done, it\u2019s the story that counts. First-time scribe Monahan has done quite an adroit job merging fact with fiction, shifting and adjusting certain elements to streamline and augment the drama but never betraying the subject matter in a way that remotely recalls the Hollywood approach epitomized by Cecil B. DeMille\u2019s laughably inauthentic 1935 epic \u201cThe Crusades.\u201d\r There really was a Balian who led the doomed defense of Jerusalem in 1187, but he was not the ordinary bloke vaulted to lofty rank played here by Orlando Bloom. Brooding over his wife\u2019s suicide after the death of their son, this Balian is shaken from sullenness by the arrival in rural France of imposing knight Godfrey of Ibelin (Liam Neeson), who informs the youth he\u2019s his father and beckons him eastward.\r Ruled by a wise Christian king, frail leper Baldwin IV (beautifully voiced by Edward Norton from behind a sculpted silver mask), the domain is further dominated by Baldwin\u2019s comely sister, Princess Sibylla (Eva Green); her snaky husband Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas), and the latter\u2019s warmongering cohort, Reynald of Chatillon (Brendan Gleeson).\r Balian finds more natural allies in Tiberias (Jeremy Irons), a peace-minded and pragmatic military expert, and the Hospitaler (David Thewlis), a court counselor who has also seen enough fighting for one lifetime.\r With all these colorful and intriguing characters circling around, the one in the center, Balian, looks bland by comparison. He seems uncomfortably like a reactor instead of an instigator, a consciously concocted Everyman designed for audience identification who has greatness thrust upon him.\r Narrative contains significant gaps, notably in the romance, Balian\u2019s adoption of his new home and especially in his rapid assimilation of military savvy. (Indeed, Scott is on record as saying his definitive cut of the film runs 220 minutes, a version he claims will be released on DVD.) Suddenly, after Reynald has outrageously provoked Saladin by attacking a Saracen caravan for no reason, it is Balian who warns in vain against Reynald and Guy\u2019s ludicrous decision to take on Saladin\u2019s army at the broiling Horns of Hattin, a miscalculation that made Jerusalem\u2019s fall inevitable.\r Scott is content with one-dimensional villains, and Gleeson and Csokas indulge him with bluster, glares and dismissive put-downs that are both delicious and far too easy.\r With CGI work improving all the time, the mix of live and computerized elements creates numerous extraordinary canvases of virtually seamless quality. Harry Gregson-Williams\u2019 score emphasizes the uniformly solemn tone of the proceedings while mixing in such diverse sounds as traditional and liturgical songs, Arabic and world music and, most surprisingly, bits from \u201cThe Crow,\u201d \u201cBlade II\u201d and a piece by Jerry Goldsmith called \u201cValhalla.\u201d"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Firstly, don't bother with the theatrical release, go straight for the director's cut.

And of course I should mention Orlando Bloom, who will probably pleasantly surprise many who watch the movie. His performance had many good things to it. A blacksmith who by way of his father's nobility and land can become a great knight in Jerusalem, Bloom was definitely solid. I understand many critical of the movie would have liked it to be a bit \"madder\" in terms of how it presented the crusades, but reading the Ridley Scott and William Moynahan (writer) wanted to retell this story by a fictionalized account with a bit of a exaggerated benefit of the doubt to peace.

Highly recommended."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "'Kingdom of Heaven' had an immensely talented cast going for it, despite being unsure about seeing Orlando Bloom in an especially substantial lead role. It also looked great from the trailer, and have liked a good deal of Harry Gregson-Williams' work which can be one of the better components of films. Ridley Scott is not the most consistent of directors, his best films like 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner' are brilliant but lesser films such as 'Robin Hood' are really not good (personal opinion of course).There are also films of his that are much better in the director's cut version. 'Legend' is one such example, but the biggest one for me is 'Kingdom of Heaven'. Found it a very mixed bag as the theatrical/ non-director's cut version and found a lot of issues with it (and this is actually forgetting the historical inaccuracies), such as choppy storytelling, erratic pacing and underwritten characters on top of Orlando Bloom and the dialogue. While it is still not a perfect film still in the director's cut version, it is a big improvement and some of what were major problems in the theatrical version are corrected.Not all though. Do still find Orlando Bloom charisma-void and out of his depth, have nothing against him but this role was a meaty one, even more so in the director's cut where he is more complex, and needed a lot of authority and a wide range of emotions and to me Bloom didn't have enough of either.Some of the middle of the film stalls a bit in the pace, the storytelling not always going very far. Although the characters are much more interesting in the director's cut edition, a few of them could still have gotten into more depth such as those with not much screen time still and the same goes with the themes, also did that the messaging at times could have been more subtle.Improvements are many though. The characters generally are far more interesting and better developed, Eva Green's went from one that one questioned the presence of and was hugely underwritten to a well fleshed out character. They interacted more convincingly and not in as stilted a fashion. Despite some aimlessness in the middle, the pace is less erratic and doesn't jump around as much. The story is uneven still, but there is generally more cohesion and less choppiness, more of a sense of resolution with the vast amount going on and for me the contemporary relevance was a good thing.Dialogue flows better and is less awkward, quite intelligent here too.Both editions cannot be faulted visually. It is gorgeously shot with lots of atmosphere and the costumes and sets are stunningly evocative, with the siege especially being quite breath-taking. In fact, the action was very tense and powerful in both versions as well but especially in the director's cut. Harry Gregson Williams' score rouses and also has emotional impact, the director's cut does it more justice and a better job is done complementing everything whereas in the theatrical version it was the case of a great score deserving a much better film. Scott directs everything skillfully which is remarkable considering there was a lot to balance. The messaging and everything regarding tolerance and the historical inaccuracies were much criticised and still are, they weren't as big an issue for me.With the exception of Bloom, the cast are very good. The standouts being an against type Edward Norton who gives a lot of complexity and intensity to his character and Gasshan Massoud showing how to do cool and menacing wonderfully. Eva Green's performance is deeply felt and Jeremy Irons shows a lot of dignity and restraint here.Overall, didn't care for the theatrical version, but this review is namely for the director's cut which is an infinitely better, if imperfect, version and is a fairer way to judge the film on. My thoughts though. 7/10"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Liam Neeson, Brendan Gleeson, and Jeremy Irons are all wonderful in small, but rich supporting roles, but I have to give a special mention to the film's best character.

Directed by Ridley Scott, the film has a screenplay by William Monahan and the cast is headed by Orlando Bloom, Eva Green, Liam Neeson and Jeremy Irons.The film deals with the crusades from a new point of view. In other movies we see Christian expeditions. In this film, we see a precise moment in history, where Jerusalem, captured in 1099, is lost again. Many of the characters is based, slightly, in real historical characters, as part of the script as well. Although I'm not an expert, it seems a film that seeks to portray things with some historical accuracy. Thus, costumes and scenery seem to have been designed with some care, in order to meet these standards. The script is interesting. Of course, the story is romanticized and not entirely correspond to the facts, but its quite entertaining and holds the audience until the end. The action scenes are excellent, particularly the battles and the final siege, where the fertile imagination of Hollywood left its mark in the original way the siege engines are being put out of action by the besieged. The scenarios are good, representing well what may have been Jerusalem during that historic period.The actors fulfilled their role on a regular basis. Orlando Bloom is equal to himself and Eva Green made some effort to look more oriental, surprising at the end by purposely overshadowing her character in maternal grief. One of the most emotive and memorable characters is King Baldwin IV, played by Edward Norton (who never shows his face in the film). He's the author of some of the most deep, philosophical and meaningful quotes.
