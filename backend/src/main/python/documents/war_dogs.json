While it is entirely derivative of many other films and, more recently, tries to emulate the success and style of The Big Short, War Dogs is still entertaining in its own right. Jonah Hill and Miles Teller have good chemistry, while Hill in particular is terrific with his shady charisma. That said, the film never accomplishes its full \"let's reveal the crookedness behind the curtains\" schtick, nor is it as funny as it may thinks it is. Other than attempts at making blowjob jokes, War Dogs really has no other comedic tricks up Jonah Hill's fat sleeves, which is unfortunate. That said, it is well told, decently entertaining film even if it falls short of its lofty goals. Another problem were the intertitles that really seemed out of place and were sort of trying to break the film into \"chapters\" for no apparent reason. Overall, War Dogs was largely disappointing, even if it was entertaining and Hill's performance is worth the price of admission. It is a film that had the pieces to be great, but lacked the heart, soul, depth, and originality to do so."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Good action comedy film, Miles Teller and Jonah Hill both give great performances, the plot is interesting and well put together, it is also well paced and funny at times."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "This is obviously Todd Phillips trying to make a Scorsese film, more specifically the Wolf of Wall Street, but he's no Scorsese. However, it's watchable and mildly entertaining and sadly that's a rare thing for summer cinema."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "War Dogs seems like a film with a ton of potential, because of the people involved in it, but lacks the spark to make it anything other than okay. The problem seems to be that the crew wanted to tell a true story and make the audience laugh but didn\u2019t fully understand, given the source material, how to do that. War Dogs is intermittently funny, but relies too much on clich\u00e9s, and fails to pack any kind of a punch. If you\u2019re trying to figure out what kind of a movie this is, picture The Big Short with a slightly lesser known crew.\rWar Dogs did have a lot going for it, namely the talents of Miles Teller and Jonah Hill, as well as the direction of Todd Phillips (The Hangover Trilogy.) Above that the trailers for this film looked fairly funny, but note that almost all of the genuinely funny parts of the movie are contained in the trailer. That being said the film often tries to take a more dramatic approach, and fails to ever generate a hilarious moment. That being said both Miles Teller and Jonah Hill\u2019s performances are great in this film.\rWhile Teller and Hill are great in this film it really feels too familiar, as if you\u2019ve seen it before. That shouldn\u2019t be the case with a film about two men in their twenties running guns in the Iraq War. That being said it ends up making it\u2019s characters into cliches, and tells an overdone storyline about rags to riches idiots, and betrayal of best friends. It really is a shame because, as I mentioned before, this film could\u2019ve been very original and interesting, but ends up being like most other films of today, more recycled than anything else.\rAbove that the film fails, at what it ultimately wants to do, which is pack a punch. It seems self evident watching it, that the director and writers wanted to expose a scary problem in America, and at the same time generate a few laughs. In that sense it\u2019s a lot like The Big Short, however War Dogs fails to ever do what it strives to do. Where The Big Short was informational, funny, and in the end terrifyingly honest, War Dogs is not. This movie may have a moment or two, but seems to miss it\u2019s intended mark on both ends, in that it\u2019s not as funny as it\u2019d like to be nor is it as damning.\rIn the end War Dogs feels like more of an average film, which is disappointing because it had the potential to do everything wanted to. If you expect a great comedy, it\u2019s not really that, if you\u2019re expecting a great look at true and terrifying events that led to two young immature men running guns for America, it\u2019s not really that either. War Dogs is funny, well acted, and has a story to tell, but relies on cliches, stereotypes, and doesn\u2019t offer very much thought provoking material. This is a good film if you want a few chuckles but it doesn\u2019t supply a ton of laughs."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "War Dogs: Shia Lebeouf & Seth are 'Murican, **** Yeah!\r Now you're thinking **** this guy he can't even get the actors right!

Don't get me wrong, you can totally tell real things that actually happened were glossed over(where did they get the guns in the first place?), changed, or just left out to make for a more widely pleasing movie. At it's core though the tale is still interesting. Not too mention we get two fantastic performances from Jonah Hill and Miles Teller.In the end War Dogs ends up being a better drama than comedy. Quite frankly, it's nowhere near as funny as those trailers let on. Part of this has to do with subject matters serious nature. Mainly though, it's an issue of timing. It's simply off. The witty and quick lines the characters are given rarely hit that right note to make you laugh out loud. You'll still chuckle, but there are plenty of times where the jokes just fly by because you are too caught up in what's going on with the actual plot.The plot itself has a few stumbles of it's own. For starters, it's really hard to care about these two characters. They're just too big of scumbags to root for. They're occasionally dumb decisions don't help either. You're supposed to be able to possibly sympathize with Teller's character, but not even looks into his family life make that possible. So essentially we're just watching two not very likable people getting involved in some very interesting scenarios that aren't quite as funny as we hoped. Normally, that would be the death of a movie like this. However War Dogs just barely manages to get by thanks to the inherently compelling nature of the events it is based on. I, for one, found myself pushing past myself and increasingly getting more and more involved with the events. Fans of \"based on a true story\" movies can likely find their fix here.So in the end it's a disappointing, but passable movie. One that could have been executed better, but still proves to be watchable and usually entertaining thanks to the great, true source material. Overall it may leave you wanting more, but it won't leave you feeling like you totally wasted your time or anything.6.7/10"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Though it may try a bit too blatantly to be like similar films that have preceded it (\"Lord Of War,\" \"Wolf Of Wall Street,\" \"The Big Short\"), Todd Phillips' \"War Dogs\" still manages to use its too-good-to-be-true narrative towards its ultimate advantage. The film is brash, infuriating, occasionally insane, and blissfully irreverent. And when coupled with the knowledge that all of this actually happened (for the most part), it makes the film that much more watchable in the end."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "War is like a business zone, anyone can start-up a business.Ten years ago a similar film was made with Nicolas Cage in the lead called 'Lord of War'. This was based on the two youngsters who got into arm dealing, but many events were fictionalised. War is a business and these two made lots of profit out of it. So it all begins when financially struggling David clueless about raising his unborn child. At a right time he meets his old friend Efraim and decides to partner with him to supply arms to the US army abroad in a small scale. But when they saw a big opportunity, they decided to give it a try. From the obstacles, they go the extra mile to achieve it. But not knowing how serious the consequences are, finally they step into a dangerous turf and from there, what follows is revealed in the remaining parts.This is really amazing film. Obviously a slow start, but like after 10-15 minutes later it gets better and better. For these actors, this is something big and they have done it excellently. Jonah Hill was simply unbelievable. Kind of good, as well as negative, totally unpredictable character. Mile Teller was superb, he narrated the story with the opening scene, gun pointed at him, the flashback begins. While the story keeps developing, it only gets crazy and crazier. Nearly two long was never been an issue, because of the good pace, as well as for the off beast storyline.Lately I have been seeing lots of Ana de Armas, quite a coincident to watch some many films of someone in a short time. Anyway, her role in this was small, but she was decent. From the director of 'Hangover' trilogy, I think one of his best films it is. If you like the American Dream themes like 'Pain & Gain' and 'Wolf of Wall Street' about making dollars in a fast way risking everything, you would enjoy it as well. Like those two, it was also a comedy, despite inspired by the real. One of the film posters imitates the 'Scareface', but there's a strong reason for that, so you should watch it. Definitely worth a watch, so I suggest it!8/10"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Todd Philips' war comedy is a film that lacks some substance, but most of it is filled up by the brilliant performances of Jonah Hill, Miles Teller and Bradley Cooper. Those actors alone make this a worthwhile watch. The plot of the film is interesting and will drag you out like other war comedies this year, but it is all seen before and done better. Guys do illegal things, buy a lot of expensive sh*t, get into trouble, cue in bromance. I wish that the ensemble of such actors could have got a better, more fleshed out film than this. It still is fun though, will make you laugh and is enjoyable as a one time watch. I found no deep storytelling in War Dogs, but it was hella fun."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The movie was enjoyable. Jonah Hill and Miles Teller had fantastic chemistry. The movie was very funny and it's almost mind blowing that all thus actually happened.

They begin raking in big money but soon get in over their heads. Also starring, Bradley Cooper, Ana de Armas, Kevin Pollak.This type of movies usually depend heavily on the coolness of the leading actors, and Hill + Teller surely is an exciting combo. Hill\u2019s work is especially noteworthy, giving the staple comedy actor a chance to create an unusually multifaceted character, a sociopathic narcissistic dude.\u201eWar Dogs\u201c also has the typical weakness of this type of movie: underdeveloped final act. After taking their sweet time showing all about the humble beginning and rise to fame and fortune, the later events are shown in a hurry. Stuff happens because it has to happen, not because the story has evolved to this point naturally.Director Todd Phillips is known for moderately funny but not especially inventive mainstream comedies (\u201eRoad Trip\u201c, \u201eOld School\u201c, 2004\u2019s \u201eStarsky and Hutch\u201c, \u201eSchool for Scoundrels\u201c, \u201eThe Hangover\u201c trilogy, \u201eDue Date\u201c). This is his first break from the mold, and surely a refreshing step in new direction.Like some of the best screen stories, \"War Dogs\" is not tied to a particular genre such as comedy or action or drama. It has a bit of everything which has always been one of the most attractive aspects of this type of rags to riches movies.By the way, the poster design is a parody of the iconic poster for mafia classic \u201eScarface\u201c, which is referenced throughout the film; also, Hill was born in 1983 when \u201eScarface\u201c was released. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s really important in some way.It's a solid way to spend nearly two hours, but there's a great number of movies of the same type already.

Judging by the trailers and the two leads, I was expecting a much more light-hearted comedy-drama, but War Dogs is actually an enthralling and at times intense film. Whilst it still has a good sense of humour, what really shines through in this film is the lead actors\u2019 incredibly striking performances, director Todd Phillips\u2019 ability to deliver such an unexpectedly dramatic atmosphere, as well as the absolutely fascinating story.So, the most important thing about this film is to go in not expecting a comedy. There are some good laughs here and there, but it\u2019s very clear that War Dogs isn\u2019t trying to be funny, rather a genuinely serious and interesting drama, only with interjections of humour to lighten the mood and provide some unnerving moments.Let\u2019s start off with the two central performances from Miles Teller and Jonah Hill. For the whole film, we see the events unfold through the perspective of Teller\u2019s character, a down-to-earth, new father who just wants to find a way to make ends meet for his family. Immensely likable and relatable, Teller is excellent from start to finish, and even when we begin to learn about some of his character\u2019s less morally justifiable actions, he works brilliantly as the person to guide you into this world of arms dealing, whilst also retaining a shred of reality.On the other end of the spectrum, we have Jonah Hill, who is terrifying. In just one of the many elements of the film highly reminiscent of The Wolf Of Wall Street, Hill plays a highly ambitious and morally dubious man who will do anything to make more and more money. From the start, his character is immediately unnerving, thanks to his terrifying cackling and clearly short-tempered nature, but as the film unfolds, Hill becomes more and more intense in the role, adding a brilliant level of dramatic depth that we really haven\u2019t seen from him before, yet another hugely impressive surprise from this film.The two work together brilliantly throughout, and are instrumental in making the wild ride the two men take through the world of international arms dealing both absolutely fascinating and surprisingly intense. What\u2019s more is that director Todd Phillips also plays a big role in getting those performances out of the actors.In general, his direction here is excellent, as he directs two very contrasting on-screen personalities and ties them together brilliantly. The entire film\u2019s atmosphere is a stroke of genius, as he retains the odd comedic relief, but still confidently delivers a very dramatic story that, after coming at you out of nowhere, is enthralling from start to finish, something that\u2019s very difficult to do.But the real reason that this film is so good is because of the story. Very loosely based on a true story of two men who got into a similar situation, it is a truly enthralling watch. The screenplay is excellent, detailing some of the most complex dealings in very simple and easy-to-understand ways, without coming off as didactic of patronising. What\u2019s more is that the story\u2019s focus on Teller\u2019s character, and particularly his relationship with his wife over the course of the years he works in this business, gives an emotional core to everything that\u2019s going on, making it feel a lot more important, and as a result interesting, than two guys hopping over to the Middle East on gun runs.Excellently paced and featuring an intense snowball effect towards an enthralling climax, I was hugely surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. Its story is fascinating, the two central performances are excellent, and the directing makes its unexpectedly dramatic vibes work brilliantly."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "\u5f71\u7247\u786e\u5b9e\u6bd4\u8f83\u677e\u6563\uff0c\u7537\u4e3b\u89d2\u6f14\u6280\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u2026\u2026\u4e54\u80d6\u88ab\u5e26\u6c9f\u91cc\u53bb\u4e86\u2026\u2026\u7fa4\u620f\u4e0a\u4f3c\u4e4e\u642d\u914d\u5e76\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u7075\u6c14\u2026\u2026\u53ea\u80fd\u8bf4\u975e\u5e38\u523b\u677f\u2026\u2026\u5bfc\u81f4\u6574\u90e8\u7535\u5f71\u90fd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e86\u7075\u6c14\u2026\u2026\u5e93\u73c0\u51fa\u573a\u4e54\u80d6\u5c31\u4eae\u4e86~~\u4f60\u4eec\u4e00\u5b9a\u662f\u771f\u7231~~~\u7fa4\u620f\u6c34\u5e73\u66b4\u589e\uff0c\u8fd9\u7fa4\u620f\u6c34\u5e73\u662f\u8981\u51b2\u5b66\u9662\u5956\u7684\u8282\u594f\u554a~~~\u5236\u4f5c\u4e0a\u591a\u5c11\u62cd\u70b9\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u554a\u2026\u2026\u7f57\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a\u548c\u963f\u5c14\u5df4\u5c3c\u4e9a\u573a\u666f\u4e0d\u4e00\u6837\u554a\u2026\u2026\u8fd9\u6837\u88ab\u770b\u51fa\u6765\u771f\u5fc3\u5f88\u7c97\u7cd9\u554a\u2026\u2026\u5b9e\u5728\u4e0d\u884c\u5c31P\u4e0a\u53bb\u554a\u2026\u2026\u5f53\u7136\u8fd9\u7247\u5b50\u53ef\u4ee5\u6df1\u6316\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u8fd8\u6709\u5f88\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u53c8\u4e0d\u662f\u300a\u6743\u529b\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u300b\u53ef\u4ee5\u62cd\u4e2a\u7535\u89c6\u5267\u4ec0\u4e48\u7684\u2026\u2026\u6316\u5f97\u8d8a\u591a\u641e\u7b11\u6548\u679c\u53cd\u800c\u53d8\u5dee\u4e86\u2026\u2026\u4e0d\u8fc7\u5e0c\u671b\u6709\u4eba\u80fd\u62cd\u4e2a\u6df1\u6316\u7248\u672c\u7684~~\u8fd9\u7247\u5b50\u7684\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u5f97\u5206\u53ea\u670957\u5206\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u7279\u4e48\u5728\u9017\u6211\uff1f\u5c31\u7b97\u5f71\u7247\u8282\u594f\u6bd4\u9884\u544a\u7247\u6162\u4e86\u5f88\u591a\uff0c\u4e5f\u6709\u4e0d\u5c11\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5546\u4e1a\u559c\u5267\u7247\u4e5f\u8981\u6309\u7167\u5b66\u9662\u5956\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u6765\uff1f\uff1f\uff1f\uff1f\u90a3\u5e73\u5747\u4e5f\u80fd\u62ff\u523070\u5206\u5de6\u53f3\u3002\u4f4e\u4e8e50\u5206\u7684\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u771f\u7684\u770b\u7535\u5f71\u4e86\u5417\uff1f\u8fd8\u662f\u5fd9\u7740\u8868\u5fe0\u5fc3\u7231\u56fd\u4e86\uff1f\u8c01\u8bf4\u4e09\u89c2\u4e00\u5b9a\u8981\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff1f"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "War Dogs is the tried and true tale of greed and arrogance wrapped up in unique circumstances.

A good, admirable one. But nonetheless a mistake. Almost as if Jonah Hill's character is going to deny or defend it.War DogsThe co-writer and director Todd Phillips makes a wannabe Adam McKay alike biography. Unfortunately, it is not smart. It is not sensible. What it is, is light on feet. And that's a double edged sword. That is not to say that when the time comes the film fails to draw in necessary emotions. Though not powerful, that pull you feel towards these characters is through performance and not the way it is portrayed. Phillips is smart enough to realize that within the next four lines the script asks him to shift the tone in a snap. What he then does, is make us walk through long one shot elaborated scenes that puts us right into the middle of the desert- often, literally! This is how the film remains to be for the most part of its run. You see each of these artists, on screen, straining themselves to achieve something higher from the script that never even existed in the first place. There is disappointment. Dissatisfaction comes from the incompleteness. Certain expectations are built in this completely-new-world, for the audience, and we are repeatedly shot down. We never get to seal the deal. The good scenes are overpowered by the dull ones and its muddy speech, is somehow, the spine of the film. How will it stand tall, then? Even Todd who is exceptional in sliding in his sense of humour, fails to cook its content into favoured crisp texture.
