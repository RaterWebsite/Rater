Instead, the film focuses on the chemistry and relationship between it's two leads, who are terrific in this film. There are more than a few genuinely funny moments, but there are also a few extremely intense and graphically violent scenes.

The found footage aspect from the perspective of an officer in the LAPD is a great concept, and is well executed early on in the movie.

It does a great job a showing parallels between the police vs. gang life (they are not that different).  Good vs. Evil was well documented and shows that everyone wants to move up the food chain.

G. trudge his way through this extended episode of 'Cops'. He is the movie's only saving grace amidst a poorly written screenplay that feels clich\u00e9 and strips the LAPD of an opportunity to be depicted somewhat accurately in a fictional setting.

It chronicled the lives of two cops caught in the war zone of crime, gangs, drugs, and violence and kept a light humor even during the worst scenes. The two young officers, their family involvement, their wives, the job, their fellow officers, personality profiles were set early and the action went from one dramatic scene to the next with gang bangers and street people actively involved in every aspect of their city's subculture. If you aren't ready for violent action, you might want to pass on this. Every minute there was constant action, dialogue, this movie had no dead air time with nothing but scenery. During the non action moments it was full of banter between the two about everything from their families to their sex lives.

It has been done many times before and done better.  Nothing new here and nothing like the Movie Trailer.  Absolute waste of time"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The various points of view and personality of End of Watch have created one of the best police dramas in years, with the shaky cam and POV technique that really immerses the viewer in the film, with said film outlining perhaps the dark side of being on the right side of the law, the trials of day to day routine but also the obstacles faced when there is always someone with a higher pay grade. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pe\u00f1a star as the two LAPD officers, Taylor and Zavala who create a tension of unpredictability and lack of safety as the film progresses. As the documentary style film unfolds, we realise these two officers end up investigating much deeper into the criminal activity in south central LA, nothing really screams new that hasn't been done before, but the way in which it unfolds can sometimes be frightening, often edgy but seriously entertaining.\rThe story is a character-driven account of these two officers as they deal with their job but also their personal lives, they discuss their ambitions and their love life, these two perfectly fit the bill of a buddy cop film, but it properly explores these two individuals and the closely wound lives they lead, they have weaknesses and fears, something which the two actors perfectly portray, these two officers are friends, they spend their social lives in each others company which makes the film hit home that much more.\rThe film itself as mentioned explores the gritty side of the police work, and the film tells a brutal tale involving trafficking and brutality of the highest level, with some very gruesome and edgy scenes that come alive with the documentary style and approach. There are laughs to be had at the very real conversations that the two share, with an excellent supporting cast to back up some of these moments.\rWriter/Director David Ayer had consistently showed his strength in the cop genre of films, and his latest is a no holds barred action flick that has a lot of heart, but tells a tragic and powerful tale of friendship and doing the right thing, End of Watch succeeds in being real, honest and forthright in the story it tells, leaving room for both the police drama and the personal story the two central characters have, elevating the charisma and heart the film has."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "This is basically a FPS film about militant, calloused patrol cops in the worst section of LA. If this type of thing works for you, great, but I was done 15-mins into it.

The film is very realistic but the wavering candid camera photography almost made one of my buddies carsick.

It's only more recently than I've warmed to Jake Gyllenhaal and both him & Michael Pe\u00f1a are great together here. The chemistry between the duo is one the most convincing and realistic buddy cop pairings I've ever seen. It's the pointless everyday conversations between the pair whilst on patrol that carries the film and makes it believable. Usually I find the found footage style camera work to be a worn out gimmick. But the majority of the time it works well here. And it plays an integral part in making the experience so intense. David Ayer's overall direction is impressive and overall I found this to be a refreshing, original, real and honest take on the buddy cop formula."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I watched this movie because Anna Kendrick is in it and I think it is absolutely amazing!

It is raw and gritty and forces the viewer to feel uncomfortable...and it does this very well. It provides a near realistic view of what it is like to be a cop...the good, the bad and the ugly...and examines a sort of \"worst case scenario.\" This movie is well acted and well executed. The camera style is intentionally shaky and raw, giving the viewer a sense of being right there with them. This is the type of movie you will watch and think about for a while. It carries large themes dealing with morals, ethics and a sense of family. It is highly recommended."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "0 = Worse thing ever made\r5 = Average\r10 = God's gift to mankind\r End of Watch is the perfect cop movie. the witty dialogue, partner chemistry, and shootouts leave nothing to be desired.

Halfway through the movie, due to the way it is filmed with lots of camera panning I felt somewhat nauseous and kept hoping it would go away.  However, the style of filming persists throughout the movie, so either sit far away or take some Dramamine before you go (I would recommend a half pill).  It took me about a half hour after it ended before I felt okay again."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pe\u00f1a are cop partners riding rough neighborhoods in LA. We get to know them mostly through their snappy banter in the patrol car, while most of the action is purportedly shot through their own cameras. We ride along as they encounter minor and major crimes, but also watch them interact with their fellow officers and their women. This camerawork and editing have a big-budget grittiness that keeps the film rooted in reality, but doesn't get in the way. Performances are outstanding and David Ayer's directorial style has become even more sophisticated, while staying \"street.\" A solid film with modern sensibilities."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This a decent film, its gritty but ultimately it has an easily predictable ending.

Two protagonists are played by great actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena.The movie is well directed and looks quite realistic. There are a couple of things I did not like.I generally do not like handheld camerawork. It was quite relevant in this particular case but I still did not like it. The other minus was a few clich\u00e9s that were used in the script. Otherwise it was a good, solid movie that I recommend to watch."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Not since Training Day has a movie grown above the cliche'd cop storylines, and Ayer is a master of this genre.

Look for Gyllenhall this Oscar season."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Officers Taylor (Gyllenhaal ) and Zavala (Pe\u00f1a) are LA cops that respect the jib they do. When a seemingly routine traffic stop leads to the discovery of guns and money linked to a Mexican cartel the pair starts investigating, putting a target squarely on their backs.\r Moving past the fact that the \u2018found footage\u2019 aspect makes little sense in this context (even the director actively ignores it at points!) the film moves along at a break neck speed whilst still finding time to explore the lead characters lives to the extent necessary that audiences can invest in the two leads. The action set pieces are also brilliantly shot meaning that, while it can stretch plausibility at times, End of Watch's almost two hour running time flies by."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Excellent film.  Spot on performances by the main cast and secondary characters.  Fresh take on the buddy cop film.  More a character study of the two main subjects than focusing on the plot, which is fairly straight forward.  Many of the incidents during the film don't get explained to any extent, and some characters pop into the film and then disappear without much information about them  The pacing is really good but the camera work is not always successful.  The over use of the hand held, shaky cam reduces the film to an episode of Southland and certain times.  This is film, not TV.  A bit of a splatter fest at times.  A must see if you're into this genre of film."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This was a purely great film. Great performances delivered into a great story. It was thrilling, it was hilarious, and it was dramatic. The only issue i had with gthe movie was the annoyance of the switching of cameras, i wanted them to just stick to one but it kept switching but after a ways into the film i got used to it but other than that this movie was great. Im not a big fan of Jake Gyllenhaal or Michael Pena fan but they were both perfect and hilarious in this film, they're \"brotherhood\" was so strong which made the film so much better because of how well they blended together. If you don't like violence or alot of strong language then don't bother with End of Watch, but if not then you must see this! Its well worth your money and your time! 9.5/10"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "With dynamic cinematography and some good writing, \"End Of Watch\" is an excellent film that takes the usual brotherhood cop formula and juices it up with some adrenaline."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "this jerky camera crap was old with blair witch; unless you're 13 or enjoy that nonsense, give this film a skip.  oh and if the excuse is \"hey it's cause they're video-taping themselves\" then get a camcorder and go out and make your own film; you couldn't do any worse than this."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Wow!  I was pretty blown away by this!  Great movie.  Gyllenhall and Pena are amazing together.  Fantastic cop movie, though the one negative for me was that there were some extremely grisly, upsetting scenes.  One scene in particular affected me more than I can remember any scene in a movie affecting me in a long time(though I am kind of a wuss in that regard!).  Definitely not something to take the kids to.  But a really good movie."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "End of Watch is one of the best cop films I've ever seen and it all starts with the fantastic cast. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pe\u00f1a are both incredible actors and the supporting cast is just as great. Because of the entire cast's acting ability, the emotion and drama felt real and authentic and really pulled you in. The action sequences were also done really well. You felt the intensity through the realism and the emoting and it really made you get on the edge of your seat at times. I also felt the the plot developed really well. Yes, the movie dragged a bit about two-thirds in but that was necessary for the development of the characters and their relationships. Without that portion, you may not care as much so I do not hold that against the movie. The only things that I do think brought the movie down were the extreme overuse of the shaky camera effect and some of the editing of scenes felt too episodic. When you're starting to almost feel a bit dizzy because the camera is shaking so much, I'm pretty sure that means dial it back a bit. I understand that there are plenty of handheld cameras used in the film as part of the plot but those are not the examples I'm referring to. The only other thing I felt was worth mentioning was the blatant foreshadowing in the film. There's a particular scene that essentially spoils the ending. I'm sure not everyone caught it but when I saw the scene I practically threw my hands into the air because I knew right then and there how the movie would end. I'm aware that directors love these little foreshadowing elements because it adds a certain level of cinematic quality but they're supposed to be subtle. Overall though, I'd say that this was a great movie and one that most people, at least those not easily offended by vulgar language and violence, would enjoy."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "By now, everyone knows that I hate these camcorder films, because they are lazy and don't really have much of a story to them, but there is an exception to that rule, and that is the TV show Cops. Police work comes with natural real life drama and action, in this instance the script really does write itself, so I was okay with it being used for a film like this. I just wish it had been done more naturally. I understand that the film takes place in a gang infested area of L.A. and that they needed to make it more dramatic and action packed for it to succeed in theaters, but you talk about going over the top. That's where Director, David Ayer comes in, after all gangs and going over the top are his specialty. End of Watch does have some great chase scenes and some really cool moments between partners, but for the most part it's just one non-stop explosion filled gun battle after another, making Los Angeles look like Fallujah. The point of view cameras do give us an interesting look at the action and some new perspective into how it's all made, which I thought was really cool, but I mean the lack of story line and constant shooting was beyond ridiculous. I'm some what surprised they'd didn't just go full on crazy and release the whole thing in 3-D."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Best Movie of the Year, Period. 5 or 6 years down the line, ask any cop about his fav movie and there's a good chance that it's gonna be this one.
