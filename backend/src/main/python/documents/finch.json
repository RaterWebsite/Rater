      "text": "Finch perhaps maybe a touch too long for some viewers (at 1hr 49min) but patient audiences should be rewarded. Hanks does what he does best in a strange picture that casts him aside a Dog and an A.I. Robot. The dog is a likable pooch and the robot, built by dying electrical engineer Tom, is programmed to care for his canine friend after he\u2019s gone. This is no kids picture and there\u2019s suspense in its bleak post-apocalyptic setting (earth decimated by a Solar Flair) spots of humor are also well-placed and don\u2019t detract from the drama. Thankfully the writers (Craig Luck and Ivor Powell) and director (Miguel Sapochnik AKF; \u2018Hunger Games\u2019) keep the focus on the central humane theme \u2013 unlike many other movies out there presently, they have avoided the superficial over-the-top spectacle and kept it mostly believable. Perhaps some aspects of the story might not hold up to close scrutiny (but who\u2019s lived on post-apocalyptic earth to know?) it\u2019s the amiable personality development between the three \u2018friends\u2019 that keeps it entertaining. The last scene offers a melancholy moment to consider Hank\u2019s character, and what he\u2019s missed in life.  Quality cinematography and music score (both original and from the past) dress it up nicely. There even seems to be rather well-chosen parallels to Don MacLean\u2019s, American Pie\u2019s father theme (?) Not to mention the symbolism of the 1984 Fleetwood RV.  Worth thinking about."

Caleb Landry Jones, as Jeff, is the best part of 'Finch'. The way he changes his voice as he develops human traits is funny and fulfilling. I appreciate the noble idea of this, but post-apocalyptic films have been done to death, so there's nothing here you haven't seen before."

But that's only if you can make it work.Tom Hanks is too proven an actor to have a hard time holding a film all by himself, and the film's production is pretty well done, but the script is weak, predictable and inconsistent.Not terrible though, just absolutely unremarkable.I believe with absolute certainty that Finch could have tried to explore and exploit other types of more interesting narrative resources, but quite fast I saw there was no interest in using other narrative variants, and the whole conduction of the story plays it safe from start to finish.Just a weekend option, if you had no better ones."

Charming performance from Hanks is a given, but the script is by turns clich\u00e9d, unfunny, corny and sappy, and usually at the same time. The robot is goofy and annoying, and the premise is totally incongruous; an apocalypse comedy with a side of sentimentality. Some critics, on automatic when they see Hanks, have, IMO, found grace and meaning where there is none. Unless the sight of Hanks deactivates your critical faculties, hard pass."

There's some quite poignant dialogue and Hanks shows his characters vulnerabilities well, even if not saying too much in certain moments. It is surprisingly moving at times. I thought the robot reminded me slightly of Wall-E from the Pixar film of the same name - his basic questions relating to/querying human emotion are quite touching. It is thoughtful and sobering...a decent film worth seeing if you can, yes."

      "text": "Finch (2021) is an Apple TV+ film starring Tom Hanks as the titular character, a couple of robots, and a dog. Set on a post-apocalyptic Earth, it is about Finch and his companions trying to survive while they set on a journey for a better location. I legitimately decided to watch it just because I saw a solo Tom Hanks with a Robot and a dog on the poster, thinking at worst it will be a middling watch. It turned out to be a heartwarming and somewhat original experience and I'm glad I made that jump. Tom Hanks, to no surprise, delivers a poignant performance as an old survivor in a desolate landscape desperate to find some way of safeguarding his only biological companion, particularly in his absence, a doggo named Goodyear played wonderfully by Seamus. He is also accompanied by a four-wheeled helping hand robot Dewey, and the best part of the film, Jeff, the humanoid bot with true artificial intelligence voice nicely by Caleb Landry Jones. Together, you set out on a journey with them that'll give make you laugh and give you the FEELS! Apart from the group, the thing I loved about this movie is that it sets itself apart from other films by focusing solely on the group and does not dive into what you'd normally expect from a post-apocalyptic setting. The meat of the experience is from small subtle things instead of having big thrilling set pieces or the typical Human conflicts. Seeing Jeff learning what it means to be Human from Finch and Goodyear in his newfound conscience had me smiling most of the film. I do wish the movie delve deeper into those Human elements and themes but I'm still satisfied with what I got.  Directed by Miguel Sapochnik, who directed some of my favourite episodes from Game of Thrones, the movie is competently made. It can be a looker at times. Written by a duo of newbies when it comes to feature-length films, Craig Luck and Ivor Powell, I admired their venture into doing something different with a setting that could have been by the numbers story. Also, while understated, the musical score by Gustavo Santaolalla added a layer of poignancy to the entire experience, especially in key scenes. Now, it is almost 2 hours long, you hardly get any detours and instead just simmer in the experience, so the entire thing is slow-paced, which I can understand can be a turn off for a lot of people but for me, it just worked. I was enthralled by it and was enjoying the characters and their journey. So if you get bored by slow-paced stuff easily, I wouldn't recommend it. Otherwise, I'd suggest giving it a try, the movie might surprise you. You leave it feeling content. A slice of life experience in a post-apocalyptic world. Something original or different, at least for me. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a solid 8/10."
