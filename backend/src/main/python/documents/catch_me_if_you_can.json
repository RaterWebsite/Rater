      "text": "This one is a Steven Spielberg biographic classic. The story of a con-man in the 1960s who conned millions of checks and took the role of becoming a Pan Am Pilot, a doctor and a legal prosecuter is very interesting to watch. To me, it was interesting to see Frank basically just go all over the place. The movie has some very talented actors like Christopher Walken, Tom Hanks and especially Leonardo DiCaprio. This is easily one DiCaprio's top 5 films of all time. He really plays the role perfectly and has that kid like sense in him that we haven't seen since \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\". Plus, Tom Hanks was a great supporting actor. I've never seen him as one of those \"side characters\". However, he manages to give a great performance as Carl Handratty. As far as storyline goes, it's all over the place. There's just so much to keep up with, but with Steven Spielberg,  you're on a great journey with this likeable character. The movie does slow down at the end once Frank gets thrown in prison and eventually starts to work with the FBI, but other than that, the movie sets a good pace. Overall, it's an interesting biography on one of the biggest con-artist's in America."

A very easy watch, this one is simply a fun and fast paced film that tells a riveting story that really hooks you in from the get go. Steven Spielberg directs this one brilliantly as usual and really tells the story of Frank Abagnale is a unique and enjoyable way. Leonardo DiCaprio is phenomenal here, as are Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken, Amy Adams, and Martin Sheen. Really great cast on paper and they all did a great job in practice. The film does a really good job painting Abagnale as neither a bad guy or a good guy, rather you just feel sympathy for him since he is so smart, but uses his brains to steal, which is too bad and, plus, his rough home life certainly makes him even more sympathetic. Overall, Catch Me If You Can is a really well told, well acted, and well directed, film, that is just infinitely fun to watch."

But let's not short the movie of its own dramatic worth. At its heart, \"Catch Me If You Can\" is not just the story of a young man forging convincing checks. It's the heart-breaking tale of the fallout that a broken home can leave lingering within the lives of its children, with the fallout in Frank Abagnale Jr.'s life namely resembling an addictive urge to cheat, steal, and run. The movie really wants us to remember this and I'm glad it does. This is also magnificently structured and executed on a screenplay front, featuring numerous twists, turns, and surprising scene dynamics that made me jealous as a screenwriter. And Spielberg's effectively expressive, period-focused direction almost needs no mention -- it's terrific work as per usual. In fact, this whole film is a terrific ride from start to finish."

      "text": "'Catch Me if You Can' has such a talented cast, the true story is a fascinating one and while Steven Spielberg is an inconsistent director he was a big childhood influence and he has proved several times that he is capable of masterpieces of iconic status.While 'Catch Me if You Can' is not quite one of Spielberg's best films (in a list that sees the likes of 'Schindler's List', 'Jaws', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'ET'), it is one of his better later films, for me that's since 'Schindler's List'. There are occasional lapses into overly-sentimental schmaltz with the depiction of Abagnale's family life, not the first or last time with Spielberg and a long way from the worst case, but that is the one fault that was had for me.Spielberg directs impeccably, both in visual style and dramatic momentum, a directorial job that just screams of pure class. 'Catch Me if You Can' further benefits from as always beautiful cinematography from Janusz Kaminski and 60s period detail that not only looks sumptuously handsome but also evocative to make one think that it is more than just a film with a 60s setting.John Williams' score is not one of his best or most memorable, but still fits really well and has the right amount of slick jazziness, whimsy and understated pathos without over-emphasising (over-emphasis was the reason why his score for 'Amistad' was a rare misfire from him). The story takes a fascinating story and makes a ceaselessly engrossing film out of it, from the ingenious opening credits sequence to the heartfelt ending, the film is long but never feels it.This is further helped by a script that has a deft mix of genuinely funny comedy, poignant emotional moments and nail-biting suspense. The characters are intriguing. Can't praise the performances enough. Leonardo DiCaprio is movie star charisma personified, and brings wit, larceny and charm to a character that is a true crook in every sense but it is easy to see why one would fall for his actions.It is easy to overlook Tom Hanks, due to the role being not as colourful or as showy, but he brings charismatic command, generosity and doggedness in a role that could have been really bland and annoying in lesser hands. Of a sterling supporting cast, Christopher Walken is especially superb, particularly in the latter parts of the film as his life is ruined. Martin Sheen and Amy Adams are memorable, and Nathalie Bye solid.Overall, even if 'Catch Me if You Can' is not one of Spielberg's masterpieces it is one of his better later films and one of his most purely enjoyable ones. Well worth catching. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

      "text": "The larky \"Catch Me if You Can\" is like a trot around the track for the thoroughbreds involved, and one of the results is that it takes them far too long to get to the finish line. A good 40 minutes too long, this amiable account of the true story of teenage con man Frank Abagnale Jr. is a case in which the talented players could have won big had they cashed out much earlier; you can literally feel the returns diminishing the longer the game is extended.\r Abagnale\u2019s autobiographical book recounts a youth so fantastic that it\u2019s amazing it took Hollywood 20 years to get around to putting it on the screen. Reeling from his beloved parents\u2019 divorce, the 16-year-old left home and discovered talents for survival that he readily turned into a genius for scamming. Playing out a string for an amazing five years, Abagnale successfully passed himself off as a Pan Am co-pilot, surgeon and lawyer while becoming a true master in one field in particular \u2014 that of writing bad checks.\r Although the film reps a lightweight breather between the darker and more grandiose projects Spielberg is taking on these days, there may also lurk a personal connection for the director with the subject of the film. After all, at the very same time Abagnale was pulling his stunts, the teenage Spielberg was dressing in coat and tie and trying to palm himself off as an executive on the Universal lot, a ploy that paid off when he got a TV directing gig by age 21.\r Setting a fizzy mood via some very mid-\u201960s animated opening credits and a jazzy John Williams theme that harks back to his \u201cJohnny\u201d Williams days as pianist for Henry Mancini\u2019s orchestra, pic gets off to a jaunty start as DiCaprio\u2019s Abagnale is introduced as one of three contestants on the venerable gameshow \u201cTo Tell the Truth.\u201d Unfortunately, neither is the mood consistently maintained nor is the climax of the TV show ever shown.\r After beginning with a framing scene of FBI Special Agent Carl Hanratty (Hanks) coming to return Abagnale from his Marseilles prison cell to the U.S. in 1969, action flips back six years to New Rochelle, N.Y. Local businessman Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken) is a romantic, better at dreaming and scheming than at supporting his family. His proudest achievement is having brought back a French girl (Nathalie Baye) as his bride after WWII, so both he and his son are brought low when her infidelity triggers divorce, a matter exacerbated by dad\u2019s troubles with the IRS.\r The FBI is on to Abagnale before long, but he proves remarkably elusive. Even when Hanratty corners the \u201cSkyway Man,\u201d gun drawn, in a Hollywood hotel room, Abagnale is able to turn the tables on his pursuer and slip away to continue his spree, this time in Atlanta.\r Spielberg and screenwriter Jeff Nathanson (the \u201cRush Hour\u201d pics) might have taken this as a cue to begin wrapping things up themselves, but instead elaborate a great deal of follow-up material to more-is-less effect.\r Info about how Abagnale, under Hanratty\u2019s tutelage, came to become a check fraud expert for the FBI after serving but part of his prison sentence is interesting and satisfyingly ironic, but could have been dispensed in a fraction of the time. Ultimately, the film pays for the excess baggage it takes on, suggesting this would have been a very good occasion for Spielberg to make his first under-two-hour film since \u201cE.T.\u201d\r Lively and appealingly retro as the picture may be, it has other problems as well. Attempt to give the story more dimensions than provided by the outlandish narrative result in a wobbly tone. While Abagnale\u2019s love for his father and evident desire to succeed where the older man has failed provides plausible psychological motivation for the son\u2019s exploits, the darkening of their relationship as the story progresses adds little and sidelines the narrative at times.\r More vexing still are the film\u2019s visuals. Due to the cues received from the opening credits, the era involved and the serio-comic approach, the viewer could reasonably expect a high-gloss studio look in the manner of a Blake Edwards picture of the period; a bright, artificially polished style would have just added to the fun.\r Instead, cinematographer Janusz Kaminski eschews old-school elegance for gobs of blown backlight cascading through windows and other sources, even to the point of obscuring faces in the foregrounds. No one in Hollywood shot movies in this fashion until the \u201970s, and the disjuncture here provides a big disappointment given the possibilities for period precision provided by the diverse locations, Jeannine Oppewall\u2019s resourceful production design and Mary Zophres\u2019 costumes.\r Charming, clean-cut and blessing his con man with an optimism that assumes the best possible outcome no matter how dire the dilemma, DiCaprio betrays not a speck of the sullenness he exhibited in \u201cCelebrity\u201d and \u201cThe Beach,\u201d nor the stoic toughness he used in \u201cGangs of New York.\u201d"

This film knows exactly what it wants to be, which is a blend between comedy and drama and features very bright tones throughout, expressing the film as a sort of real life Tom and Jerry. This film doesn\u2019t rely on fast, action sequences and car chases but expresses a depth of interest based on the truly intellectual Frank Abagnale J.R, who really grabs your interest as you\u2019re left baffled at how such a young man can surpass the police skills of an agent and earn such a high quantity of money before the age of 18. This film not only succeeds as a cat and mouse drama but as a biopic \u2013 this film introduces DiCaprio\u2019s character in such a way that it really elevates the feeling you\u2019re on this personal crime journey with him; though the emotional power this film really fleshes out the true reasons why he is selecting the dangerous side of life and that can make you smile and almost respect the character. As I first mentioned, this film has some of the best pacing I\u2019ve ever seen, no scenes feel too drawn out or too short, and that\u2019s another factor that really increases the intrigue. Overall, this is a great watch and definitely one of Spielberg\u2019s best films. Therefore, I\u2019m going to give this a 9/10 \u2013 94%"

And when my parents got divorced it was crushing. So when Frank's parents got divorced I felt his pain and confusion. I understood why he ran away.

The film follows the origins and life of the main character, as well as the original and daring way in which he escapes justice until he is invariably caught.In addition to being an extremely fun movie to watch, with a game of cat and mouse full of comedic moments and some familiar melodrama to add some dramatic density to the main character, it has two extraordinary actors at an excellent time in their careers: Leonardo Di Caprio is charismatic, talented, and still young enough to give life to a teenage character; Tom Hanks appears more restrained and in a role of maturity but charged with charisma and personality Both actors are good and complement each other, sharing the protagonism and creating a good and pleasant collaboration to feel. The film also features Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen in secondary roles. Walken stands out particularly, with an appealing character and dialogues loaded with impact and meaning.I didn't feel that the film stood out for the more technical aspects. Its value is based on the performance of the actors, the story told and the way it entertains and entertains us. However, it is a film directed by Spielberg and that usually means quality: in fact, the film has excellent cinematography and was very well shot. The color, the light, all the camera work and editing were done with excellence and attention to detail. Because it is a film set in the Sixties, it also has a series of details that transport us to that time (used cars, scenarios and furniture that are emerging, the presence of some iconic brands and emblems of the time, namely in what concerns commercial aviation, clothes and costumes, fashion and hairstyles), which exude credibility, verisimilitude and historical rigor. I believe that I must also highlight the ingenious and fun way in which the initial credits were conceived, being an element that, right from the beginning, announces the tone and ambience of the film we are going to see. Last but not least, the good soundtrack, signed by John Williams."

It also helps that in his two leads, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks, Spielberg has actors who are capable of switching effortlessly between drama and comedy. The result is an enjoyable, although not ambitious, holiday outing. At 140 minutes, Catch Me if You Can is a little on the long side. Although, for the most part, it moves quickly, the final fifteen minutes are protracted and arguably unnecessary. In his attempts to redeem Frank, Spielberg may go too far and let the movie continue past the point where it begins to run out of steam.(Breezy comic drama by superstars)."

Although dramatized, \u201cCatch Me If You Can\u201d is a riveting and non-fictional tale of a man who successfully conned his way through several high profile jobs. I have never seen a movie with more sub plots, so in my opinion this keeps things very interesting. Still waiting to see another movie as exiting as this one."

The performances are all brilliant and contribute to the entertainment value of the film."
