After all he did say he needed money to make Armour of God 3 and he's even admitted to hating most of his Hollywood movies.  So go figure.  No wonder this was so terrible.  Miley Cyrus' dad was in this, what more needs to be said?"

He seems to bring a certain amount of fun to what would otherwise be a very bad (rather boring) film. It's the worst film I've seen with Jackie Chan in it though. I should hate it but I can't!"

And this shows his constant repetition in action comedy movies with enough emotion to make you reel over the edge of your seat and gag, but make sure to do this only if you are on the last seat of the aisle. Otherwise, try to hold it down."

      "text": "Bob(Jackie Chan) and Jillian(Amber Valetta) are an item, lovers, to the utter dismay of the divorced woman's children, who complain that their neighbor is \"boring\", a \"geek\". To them, the mother could do a lot better, since this suburban mom is a total milf, and obviously, \"so far above [Bob].\" Conspicuous in its absence, as the kids read Jillian the riot act concerning her latest beau, is any mention of Bob's ethnicity. Since they don't address the very pertinent fact about this bespectacled man being Chinese, the moviegoer is left to interpret their bias against Bob as either being racially-motivated or not, since the \"The Spy Next Door\" is too innocuous to acknowledge this rupture in the film text. \"The Spy Next Door\" treats Bob's Chinese heritage like a secret identity, like Clark Kent keeping Superman under wraps until the time is right to tell Lois Lane. Chan, sporting black horn-rimmed glasses, in fact, resembles Kent, and quite pointedly, during a dinner scene with Jillian, takes them off when he attempts to tell her about his secret life as a spy. Also, this moment doubles as a reflexive move for the moviegoer, because it alludes to Chan's past glory as an action hero(practically a superhero of sorts to his fellow countrymen), a persona that eventually emerges from the trappings of this domestic comedy. It's no accident that Bob reveals himself at a Chinese restaurant, in which Jillian's kids are explicitly confronted by his true identity as a spy, and minority. Earlier in the film, they go through Bob's personal belongings at his home, but find nothing that addresses his otherness. The DVDs, the clothes, the overall decor of Bob's lair, confirm his \"boring\"-ness, and the post-colonial construct of the screenplay is preserved, for the time being. As a romantic lead, Chan does nothing more than trade chaste kisses and a brotherly hug with Valetta, which has the effect of making Bob seem vaguely asexual. Jillian's actions, are like the children's actions, which seem to be quietly dictated by Bob's nationality. The kids can't hate him because he's Chinese, and also, Jillian can't really kiss Bob for the very same reason."

      "text": "What were they thinking putting Jackie Chan in a horrible movie,to be as a spy and protecting those annoying children like this? It's like raping the master of kung-fu for putting as a spy and making fun of him with lousing slapsticks. The scenes are too cheap for the visual effects and a waste of the script,the characters are annoying,too many plot points,the jokes are not that funny,and very insulting for putting Jackie Chan in it. Come on people,it's Jackie Chan,the greatest martial arts master who fights and leaps on the poles,and making him downsize for his acting and hurting him so purpose. Even why George Lopez plays as a villain for taking over the world? He really needs to fire his agent! And why they put a teenager girl who finds this older boy so attractive and the older boy fights Jackie Chan? I don't why they make this movie so bad and please the fans will probably like it,but come one what bad movie for putting Jackie Chan on it and it's not entertaining family film for the kids!"

It was made to make you laugh, to forget your stressful day and in that sense the movie succeeds in every way. Oh don't lie i bet you all laughed your a** off watching it. Probably the job of criticism is too stressful that you can't enjoy a lighthearted movie. Take off your mask! Jackie Chan is awesome, the youngest kid (Alina Foley) is too adorable."

But why don't they spend that time praising the movie's good points? BECAUSE THERE AREN'T ANY!!! So what's wrong with this movie? Well Billy Ray Cyrus is in it.......I could end the review just with that. There are way more problems than that though. Bland and obvious story, jokes that could be seen from miles away and appealing to it's key demographic so desperately it makes the Oogieloves look subtle. If you value your brain cells, make like a spy and stealthily, quickly get the hell away from this movie!"

The characters are all so stereotypical, like the evil Russian guy and the little girl who loves pink sparkly dresses and pink sparkly in general. The plot is just like every other action movie, but is not executed have as well. If you care about your entertainment level, I recommend not watching this."
