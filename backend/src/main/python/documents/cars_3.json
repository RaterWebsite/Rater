However, while watching the film I definitely knew what was coming next. The film didn't even try to be unpredictable. Having Cruz Ramirez race at the end is touching and shows change for McQueen from the first Cars movie, as he doesn't only think about himself. But me being a huge Lighting fan, it is a little disappointing to not have him win his last race, it almost seemed like he gave up. Still, it is a great film for kids."

Unfortunately this movie shows the limits of its own world setting by rehashing the Cars 1 plot (with a predictable twist) and somehow the pacing in this world of Cars really drags its feet. Maybe its talking cars, but I felt really conscious of the fact I was listening to voice talent in a recording booth such was the lack of drama or character. Overall sub par for pixar."

      "text": "2017 was so far a surprising year for movies,especially for animation. But now,watching Pixar come back to Cars (AKA my least favourite Pixar franchise) almost made me want to puke. But then,trailer after trailer,my interest grew up and up,becoming one of my Most Anticipated of this Summer. And it turned out that i didn't regret it at all (like Cars 2 back in 2011). The story was great (you'll probably get some Rocky III/IV vibes at some point),with messages about never giving up and dealing with becoming old. The animation almost reminded me of The Good Dinosaur (another Pixar flick),because of the beautifully crafted landscapes and the well-detailed cars (that kinda made me think that those cars came out straight from a Gran Turismo game). This time,we have some new additions to the movie,like Cruz Ramirez (probably the funniest charachter in the movie) and Jackson Storm,the main villain of the movie (and probably one of the charachters to have a short screen-time). And the rest was fine,like the charachter development,or the groundbreaking soundtrack by Randy Newman. In the end,this is not another Toy Story 3 or another Finding Dory,but it's still well-made. It's funny,it's poignant,it's Pixar at its best. Cars 3 may not be the best Pixar movie,but it sure is the best installment in the trilogy. And yes,it's better than Cars 2 and all those 'Furious' movies."

The story follows Lightning McQueen as he struggles while trying to beat new top tier racers. During the story he visits many new places for help, and it can be surprisingly emotional. The ending is also the best the Cars series has had. It isn't predictable which is nice, it has great voice actors, and the animation is almost perfect. The only downside is that they didn't show enough of the original Cars characters, but maybe that was for the best. It is way better than most people are saying, so go see it, you won't be disappointed."

I like the idea of 'retired racer finds new life as a trainer', but I found it hard to like Cruz Ramirez and I was left more interested in Smokey and the storyline around the Hudson Hornet. I also think the storyline went a little wonky. I would have rather seen Lighting crash, then try a comeback, fail, then go see Smokey and discover the potential for a new life as a trainer where he discovers a new racer with the potential to beat Storm. Then, he/she wins in the final race at the end with the help of Lightning who taps into the advice from the Hudson Hornet."

So much futuristic cars come in and so, Jackson Storm is the most advanced and McQueen couldn't beat him and blah blah blah. He is defeated and has to train because he wants to go and beat Jackson Storm. This final installment gave me shock, depression and happiness also giving funny jokes to everyone. The prediction is like you know how it is. I predicted pretty easily from the trailers and also it was kind of predictable like when McQueen manages to stop Miss Fritter but tries to defeat her but she stand up successfully. That's all for this review and so I call it 7/10 also OK/Good. Plus, I was a Cars fan."

      "text": "Where can I start?I went to see the movie with a very big hype, afraid to be like the second one that is pretty bad. And I wasn't disappointed. The story is very well thought out and makes you see another side of Lightning McQueen, which is very good. They chose not to be a hero vs. villain story but rather a self-maturing one, it was a cool touch, at least for me.Lightning McQueen is amazing in the movie, showing his willingness to run and also his side of a very experienced guy. I can see that the film focuses on only 3 characters, which doesn't mean that it choked others, quite the opposite. I was also able to see that after the \"failure\" of Cars 2, they chose to shorten the screen time of Mater, which really (and unfortunately) seems to be his place as a secondary character. Cruz Ramirez is a very good character with a possibility for many cool things (maybe even a movie, who knows?), also innovating being a main woman pilot, since in the second there was also one, but it was not highlighted at all. Jackson Storm is a good rival that motivates the public to cheer even more for the protagonist, but would not say that it is memorable, it is just what it is: a rival.The film doesn't go wrong in practically anything, being able to hit forward with many good Pixar films. He is better than the first and EVEN better than the second. By the way, let's forget the second. You can very well see the first one and jump right into the third, since Cars 2 didn't add practically nothing to the trilogy. To make it clear, I don't hate Cars 2, but after seeing this new movie, I could see how inferior it is, even to the first. If it's still on, go to the movies and draw your own conclusions, but I'll tell you: You will not regret it."

      "text": "A huge disappointment. The trailers really looked awesome and like the movie would be about Lightning McQueen making a triumphant comeback after suffering a huge loss. But no..... The movie starts out with 10 year racing veteran McQueen at the top of his game and having fun. Then come in all the more technologicaly advanced cars who go 210+ mph and everyone but McQueen goes into retirement or is fired, and he has a huge crash from pushing himself too hard. It then cuts to him back home and nothing of his crash or trauma are mention again. Encourage by his girlfriend to get back out there, Lightning goes to retrain at the training center of his new boss. Now Stirling was an interesting character but not really used much other than as a sort of antagonist who was more interested in money than taking care of Lightning himself or racing. Lightning gets this new trainer, Cruz, who is supposed to be able to get athletes into proper racing form but she spends more time making fun of Lightning for being over 30 and old, like a lot, embarrassing him or treating him like a grandpa. Seriously, she never listens to him or ask him if he\u2019s happy she just annoys him. Frustration leads Lightning to mess up a racing simulator and having to make a deal to stay in the racing game if he wins a big race in a few weeks time. So he goes to train outdoors because y\u2019know over 30\u2019s don\u2019t like technology and stuff. But he has to take Cruz with him and here it becomes obvious that she really is just nothing more than a fitness coach because she is hopeless out side and can\u2019t race. So Lightning has to waste time training her because cruz is the 20 something year old who only works with tech and the outside is a foreign, scary place for her.This goes on for a bit, Lightning looking after Cruz and she in no way helps him train or anything for his big race. A few days away from it we learn that oh no she wanted to be a racer but was to afraid to be one and wimped out. It\u2019s here we\u2019re supposed to feel sorry for her but I didn\u2019t. At all. She doesn\u2019t seem to realise that this means a lot to Lightning, it\u2019s his life and income but no, her failure as a racer is what\u2019s going to be important.Lightning then goes to the home of his old mentors  teacher, and him and all the old cars from the 1940\u2019s to 1950\u2019s also make fun of Lightning and call him old, excessively. They try to train lightning but it\u2019s clear by now that the focus of the movie is Cruz and her life not Lightning making a come back as the trailers portrayed. Lightning goes to his race and out of the 43 racers he\u2019s the last. He still makes it to number 14 in the 250th lap (there\u2019s 500) but quits mid race to let Cruz have a shot at being a racer and start her career. It feels cheap. The ending was a huge disappointment and some people got up and left the cinema around me. I mean the jokes were bad, the movie was Ames\u2019s of plots and characters and it all feels forced. Cruz feels like a cheap knockoff McQueen who never really works for her racing career, she has to be given it whilst all the other cars worked for it. She can do things no one else can with little training and taking over from some one half way through a race is cheating. Yes you can switch drivers in a race but the car is the same. This is more like if a runner switched with another to finish a race whilst all the other runners had to do the full thing. She\u2019s not a good character for girls or women empowerment by being annoying, half-assed at her job, or having to get her career given to her because she can\u2019t work for it herself. There is some hope though as Lightning said he would continue racing after he trained Cruz for the season so maybe, just maybe we will get to see Lightning be a champion like Pixar are always telling us he is. It would be nice to see him work through a movie, fight for his place at the top and win, spectaculary. This is something he has never done in any of the movies. He either gives it up to be kind or give someone something ( this plot is used here like in the first movie, so it\u2019s got rehashed plot lines) or mater was the main lead. Pixar show us champion Lightning. He\u2019s been nice, a good friend and nice again. Show us this winner you keep telling us about. That would be a really good movie unlike this one."

Oddly enough, though, I actually find it to be my favorite of the \"Cars\" films. Beyond the typically beautiful animation, I appreciate that Pixar actually took the series back to the racetrack, focused on Lightning more, and made the film a bit more mature, kept the film from feeling like too much of a retread, and actually adding some legitimately emotional and tense moments in the film. Is it one of Pixar's best? No, definitely not. Is it still an enjoyable film? I think so! And even if you aren't too interested in the series, it's worth checking out to see what side of the fence you sit on here."

      "text": "\"Cars 3\" wasn't tuned enough to get out from the garageThe anthropomorphic Cars universe returns to the race after a criticized pit stop called \"Cars 2\". On this occasion, emblematic Lightning McQueen retakes the wheel to run into the crude law of reality: the retirement. His components don't evolve, his environment does, therefore, while the beloved car stands up against a new horde of technological newbies, must choose which direction he will take for his future: he decides when he's done.Although it's difficult and paradoxical to say, keeping in mind the elaboration dimensions of the near magnanimous Pixar, the \"Cars\" franchise, despite being one of the most profitable animated proposals for the company via films and merchandising, is the lightest and less prodigious in the history of the American computer animation film studio.  Have you ever wondered why Pixar releases one more installment on the family of automobiles, considering the results of its spoiled predecessor? Well, the answer is John Lasseter. With over 20 years as animator, director, producer and, in short, Pixar leader, this man is the main promoter of the saga, because, in addition to advising the different fields of making feature films, he has directed the two car films, provoking he keep a deep affection towards his universe, and who does not like it? It's such the faith in his speed world that has put his hands on fire by Brian Fee and Lightning McQueen, in the directorial debut of one and in the emotional \"retirement\" of the other.Fee accepted the big vote of confidence of Pixar to appropriate the third entry into the motorized universe. The filmmaker increases the mileage of the saga, converting it into the best easygoing proposal among its predecessors, balancing doses of nostalgia with realistic and sensitive skids, basing on a mature message, which, although it does not make muddy dealing with questions of delicate importance, it inserts misogynist missives, of course, relegating the special emotional and comic impact placed on the characters and the story.Although it falters keeping a constant pace and proposing attractive novelties in any of the narrative points, Pixar is characterized by producing ecstatic wonders in technical and/or animation fields, and this is not the exception. They don't infest exotic settings with which to profit, otherwise, exhibit once again, they return to the roots one way or another, however, get stuck neither in plain beauty of the deserts adjacent to Radiator Springs  nor in the traditional race track; the feature film goes from a sumptuous training complex to a speedy journey with Mack, where landscapes are interspersed majestically. The script overtakes the flaws of the second one by far, in this movie is appealing to sentimentalism through a dramatic effect, which is led by inescapable acceptance of age, an irreparable beginning for novice new generations. It's pertinent, but the incorporation of technology feels like an excess, and although cinema is lately motivated by this, it's not a necessarily leading element. Precisely, the theme of legacy is the one that raises the final twist and the corresponding gestation from the second act, since the first half hour is decaffeinated, slow and tiring, a stretching of the daring opening monologue that emulates the portent of the first film: \"I'm faster than fast\", but in fact, there's a shortage of gasoline. In consideration of characters, it was thrilling to know what the screenwriters would do with the car #95, in order to he resumes the leading role after, incomprehensibly, the main attention was concentrated in the comic relief of the saga: Mate, in the same way, inexplicably, they give him a tight participation with few effective jokes but a big futility, perhaps, so that the audience would not disperse their attention from the true star. McQueen and his new flock of characters, in which is Cruz Ramirez, a coach sport car with aborted dreams about being a pro driver, they possess charisma and spark required to raise the level towards the end of the footage, their motivations and actions are more prudent, revealing a pure and human story, without decorations or possibilities of questioning perception, an undeniable feature that makes Pixar, Pixar.\"Cars 3\" by Brian Fee turns on the engines of a franchise that was already parked in the garage, generating real opportunities to roar the car, textually, in upcoming years with the help of new\u2014fixed\u2014 ideas. With regard to the (hi)story of McQueen, he has an ending as nostalgic as uncomfortable, the trouble is that doesn't succeed it with the melancholy that \"Toy Story 3\" achieved, reducing everything to a childlike thing, a car journey lacking impact, and although, in small extent, it's thankful, on the other hand, placed it as one of the less interesting Pixar films, as this world-class company is not only characterized by its visuals, but also by heart of its stories."

The characters in my opinion are fantastic, Cruz was a terrific addon onto this franchise and the mention of Doc in this movie made it even better. The best moments that i had from this movie when unpredictable things happen like letting Cruz finish the race for Mcqueen,it was fun and enjoyable. I gotta say Cars 3 is a great movie compared to Cars 2, but the original Cars would always be the best. Overall it sums up to be a good 'Thursday' night out with friends."

Pixar just made Cars great again, and BOY, did they EVER do that! This film took everything great about the original Cars in 2006, and it just made it go full max speed, and fire on all pistons!"

      "text": "An absolute disappointment. The trailers looked awesome, as did some of the artwork for the movie but instead we get this messy let-down movie that contradicts itself, is full of bad jokes, gender stereotypes ( you damn millennial and gen z kids), age-shaming ( constantly. the never let up on calling Lightning this throughout the movie) and basically retires Lightning McQueen for this Scrappy-do/Mary sue like character Cruz (who looks like a big mouthed house-car, has to be given everything, y'know confidence, training, her wins and half-asses her way to stardom), who is to be the new face of the franchise. Well sorry Pixar but I highly doubt you'll have much of an audience for the next Cars movie after this one. The movies beginning had McQueen lose out to all these digital cars (who never would have been in a NASCAR race) and crash (this is pretty horrific looking). He then decides to give racing a go again but his new trainer, Cruz, is so goddamn useless that it's almost painful to watch all the constant embarrassment and humiliation Lightning has to suffer from her. He eventually has to make a deal that will let him continue to race, if he wins, but has to take cruz with him. Big mistake! The movie goes from being a comeback movie to CREED....you lied Pixar....you lied. The rest of the movie is predictable plot lines/montages of Lightning training but actually training cruz as well and at the final race, where he does really good, puts her in to give her a chance at racing because women can't do it themselves y'know ( I am being sarcastic here). They can only get their chance if a guy gives it to them. Plus Cruz, who is not a pro racer or expert or anything, wins the other half of the race and everyone's like \"Yay! a girl won! look look look!!!!! \"Yes Pixar, we are very much aware we can race and win at things, thank you. Blah...it's all just message after message and disappointment. I really cannot see kids going out and asking for Cruz toys (girls as well as boys) after this movie. Oh! And it earned Pixar back, after production costs, 134 million less than Cars and 154 million less than Cars 2. That says something alright about this."

      "text": "Although I found it to be an ever-so slight improvement over the second film that we'd all love to forget even happened, unfortunately, that isn't saying much for the case of this third outing. Granted, the film does bring a few decent aspects to the table that keep it from just barely not sinking to the level of the second film. For one, it doesn't even mention the second film or contain a single character from that one at all (thankfully). Second, it does something that truly surprised me in a rather good way. Paul Newman, who voiced Doc Hudson in the first film back in 2006, and also sadly passed away two years later in 2008, had his voice featured in this film from recorded dialogue from the first film that went unused. Therefore, one of my favorite aspects from the first film was focused on more, which was Newman's voice talent and Doc Hudson's relationship with Lighting McQueen. That was truly a pleasant surprise for me that I so wish would've been enough to redeem the rest of this film for me, because aside from these positive standouts that I've mentioned, the rest of the film felt very uninspired and lazy, especially story-wise (if you've seen Rocky 3, you've basically kind of already seen this too). Overall, its few positive aspects, as well as the endearing and final return of Newman's voice talent made this a decent comeback effort from Pixar on behalf of the embarrassing second film, but it simply wasn't enough to save the rest of the film and its story unfortunately."

      "text": "Cars 2 is my least favorite Pixar film of all time and I'm happy to say that this recent feature of the Cars franchise is a vast improvement.  It isn't as good as the first film, however.  Thankfully we do get to see Radiator Springs again, if briefly.  The movie doesn't have a true Villain, just a snotty newcomer who we only see during the races.  Speaking of the races, they are thankfully short and not drawn out.  The movie is mainly about Lightning McQueen facing retirement and passing the baton to another racer.  It is also refreshing to see an animated film that is geared towards boys.  75% of animated films are made for little girls these days.  Not to say that both genders won't enjoy it, just relieved it's not another Princess movie."

What bothers me most about the movie is the ending, which is frankly so unbelievable it hurts. Spoileralert......McQueen retiring and his new trainer, who always wanted to be a racer but couldn't handle the pressure, is now suddenly better than an entire new generation of racers, due to what exactly? Stealing McQueen's spark? I'm sure the message they wanted to bring is valuable, but when even the kids are a bit down because Lightning will never race again they could have done things differently for a better movie experience."
