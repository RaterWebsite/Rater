      "text": "El Camino is entertaining, features great cinematography (that improves upon Breaking Bad) and a great acting performance from Aaron Paul (arguably better than in the series). It deals with some necessary realities an truths of the aftermath of Breaking Bad, especially in the first scene where Jesse discusses \"put[ing] things right\" and Mike reminds Jesse, \"that's the one thing you can never do.\" But by the end of El Camino, Jesse is essentially in the same place he was at the end of Breaking Bad - in terms of his arc and development, but just with fewer loose ends. It's a likable movie and not useless, as it certainly adds helpful details and answers some questions, but only if we consider it an addition to Jesse's story, rather than the final conclusion of Breaking Bad. Ultimately, you can make your own call - is Jesse's story better left with the question marks and uncertainty? I think nothing was going to beat his final scene in Breaking Bad and that was possibly the perfect conclusion for him, but I did not regret watching this."

Thankfully, most of my concerns were for nothing, as this is an extremely well put together production. While I absolutely adore the beauty and ambiguity of Jesse driving off, joyful tears in his eyes, at the end of the show, there is still more to Jesse\u2019s journey that we didn\u2019t get to see. Aaron Paul is as good here as he was in the best episodes of the show; he hasn\u2019t skipped a beat, and he\u2019s totally Oscar-worthy. It nails the look and feel of the show, and the cameos from characters are wholly satisfying and awesome. It may be a little overlong for how much plot there is; I could easily see this being condensed down into the length of an episode, but I was never bored. I do wonder if this would\u2019ve been better if it was instead a little miniseries of maybe four or so hour-long episodes (something that Netflix has done before with Gilmore Girls; hopefully this would\u2019ve turned out a little better than that did) instead of a single two hour chunk, but I\u2019m still happy with what we got."

He comes to the conclusion that he needs to escape and forever by using the Vacuum cleaner repair man from the original series, in an episode where Saul tells Jessie about a guy that can make him disappear forever.Movie was not needed, Many people wanted to see Walter survive and continue the business but this did not happen, We do however get treated to a nice flashback scene of Walter and Jessie at a Denny's sometime around season 3 or 4 maybe. Walt and Jessie have one last argument and one last hurraw before the final curtain.Final Grade C-Movie was not Needed and probably not wanted from certain people, Plot was good but pointless, did not add anything new other than Jessie escaping and hatching a plan to disappear forever. Fans of the series will like and hate this film at the same time. If this was the real plot of the film Gilligan wanted to film than shame on him as it's not that great."

The movie doesn't stand well on it's own and requires the audience to watch the previous 5 seasons of breaking bad to fully grasp the nature of what's occurring in the movie. The movie is more a homage to the fans of breaking bad who want more. Aaron Pauls performance was excellent and the cinematography was above average but the story of Jesse after the events of Felina felt conflicted with the cluster of flashbacks which served little to no purpose at all and dint add much to the story. On the whole, if you're a fan of Breaking Bad you will most likely appreciate this Netflix Original. I gave this movie a 7 as it serves a solid epilogue and does a good job of rounding off the story of Jesse Pinkman."

But aside from that the movie is a excellent singular character focused story. The film properly offers closure to Jessie's story, and manages to keep bringing parallels to do he was before and who he is now. That he rejects the idea of throwing away his code of morality, evolving as a person while staying true to his heart."

The film is very much in the same tone as the series, dangerous but sprinkled with light and dark humour, and many great tension building scenes. There are also other returning characters from the show, most memorably Todd, aka Meth Damon. The movie is shot well, nice and crisp cinematography, lit with very neo-noir lighting. Flashbacks are used very well within the narrative, explaining Jesse's movements and motives, and foreshadowing future events. And just like the series, music is handled well, in particular, a scene involving Meth Damon and a truck. The movie satisfactorily concludes Jesse Pinkman's arc. I was delighted returning to the BB universe, and I'm happy with the way they chose to end it."

Besides what some people say, I don't believe the movie gives any kind of closure, it simply shows what happens to Jesse (Aaron Paul) right after the events of the finale. It also has a lot of flashbacks that are recieved with a certain feeling of nostalgia.The writting dosen't try to fly too high or be too creative and unfortunately when the topic is Breaking Bad the hype is real and I expected a more clever plot. It does create suspense in many ocasions and although it didn't match my expectations I consider the writting good enough. Maybe not as good as the best episodes of BB, like the train heist, but definetely as good as an averege episode. Just keep in mind that an average episode of Breaking Bad is better than the best espisodes of many, many other shows.Location scouting and scenarios really shine here. It's a very beatiful movie. The camera work is great and creative witch helps in creating imersion and suspense. The color grading is also very well done.It's very slow at times, but hey, it's Vince Gilligan, it's Breaking Bad, what else could you expect?If you are a fan of the show, it's a must watch. If you've never seen the show, the movie is great on it's own but I really recomend watching the show first. After all, it is a folow up."

      "text": "Want to know what happens to Jesse Pinkman after the finale of Breaking Bad? Then here you will get to know-and the results may be quite satisfying but thats only because we have known the character for such a long time. In fact, maybe the best way to describe El Camino is by comparing it to going to your grandmas for lunch. Its safe, its comfortable, you know you love her soup, but nothing in there will surprise you or excite you beyond that. Getting to see old faces, seeing those beautiful shots of New Mexico and the sharp direction of Vince Gilligan is all good and takes you back to the days of the show, but there is just not enough of a story here to compensate. What ultimately happens in the story is what you would have probably guessed back then that Jesse would do to find a new leaf on his life. Furthermore, as cool as it may be to see other characters from the show, it turns out to be distracting  as well to see them not look as they used to 6 years ago when the show was running- an understandable thing considering people age, but since the story takes place immediately after the events of the finale, it is distracting nonetheless. For Breaking Bad fans, this is an insightful part of the story that shows more of Jesse and his struggles during his captivity and his means to freedom, and in that regard, considering it is on Netflix, it is an easy watch- but generally speaking, lets just say that there isn't much here to get excited about, and I may even call it, an unnecessary trip back to Albuquerque."

Jesse's adventures with Todd are the biggest misstep, as somehow racist biker gang Todd apparently lives in a hip, modern apartment and employs a maid service (????!!!!!).  And when you're not getting the flashback \"fan service\" treatment, Jesse spends his time dealing with plot-point, nobody characters. All these 10 reviews are Breaking Bad fanboys over-excited to get any further glimpse of the universe, this sucked.

And the end the result just wasn't as emotionally endearing, mainly because there was not enough conflict or momentum focus between him and the police. The movie was a flachback throwback escapee film, but had Vince given us an adverserial police character, connected to the Walter White investigation months prior to Jesse's escape, it would've brought more resonance and a sense of intrigue rather than the forgettable hippies they gave us. And it would've forced the film to spend much more time in the moment than in the past.

Breaking Bad the movie should now be discussed in terms of being one of the greatest television-to-movie continuations of all time.Nobody should be surprised. Gilligan wrote, directed, and produced 'El Camino.' Throughout the film's masterful puppetry of drama, humor, and violence, we know it's Gilligan who is lording over it all, deftly manipulating the marionette strings.He's the reason why the show-and now the movie-exists as a tragicomedy that pirouettes at both ends of the tragedy-comedy spectrum. The same goes for David Chase's 'The Sopranos,' a show that similarly has its place on the Mount Rushmore of television. Perhaps Gilligan learned from Chase that humor makes the violence palatable and violence makes the humor essential.Regardless, Gilligan put his legacy on the line by endeavoring to make 'El Camino.' In doing so, Gilligan doubled down, wagering everything on himself. The result? Gilligan won. Again."

      "text": "[EMPTINESS]When I watched the last episode of Breaking Bad roughly two years ago, I felt a huge amount of emptiness. First, because I finished one of the greatest TV shows of all time and I felt like I lost something at that moment that was very dear to my heart. It was hard to let it go.Second, because I felt that Jesse's storyline was left unresolved and unfinished. As much as I loved the Breaking Bad finale - after all, it was cathartic, satisfying, and deeply impactful on an emotional level - in the past two years I kept wondering what happened to Jesse after his escape. I always felt that this story would be well worth telling.It looks like this lingering question was in Vince Gilligan's head too the whole time since he finishied his (near) masterpiece of a series, but he only decided to answer it 6 years after the show's original run has ended. Now, after finishing El Camino, there's one question I asked from myself. Is this story really needed to be told, and if so, was this the right way to tell it?Because the thing is, I thought that after I'll watch this movie, I'll get a real closure, I'll have a fullfilling, meaningful, and deep cinematic experience, I'll get a definitive end to a character's life and to a brilliant series. I thought that if we get a 2 hour continuation to Breaking Bad in the form of a movie after all these years, there's has to be a strong reason for that.I thought that I'll see something in the veins of Drive (to give you an example) - a movie with a high level of tension and suspense, an artistic piece of cinematic work about a person with a troubled life who is seeking for personal redemption and ultimately, is looking for an escape from his past.I expected a lot of things but I have not expected the feeling of emptiness to hit me for the third time after finishing the movie. But this is exactly what I've got. El Camino felt like a mostly pointless and lukewarm epilogue to a brilliant series, instead of something that would have elevated its brilliance to even greater heights.It was a two-hour feature film, yet it felt like there's so little happened in it. It was a movie that was almost completely devoid of any real tension. It was a movie basically about nothing. Without giving away any spoilers (it wouldn't really be possible anyway), the whole script can be summed up in one sentence. Basically, Jesse went to some places to grab some money and then he travelled to somewhere. Literally, that's it.There are so many ways this story could have been told and/or expanded, there are so many interesting plotlines that could have been explored. Or at the very least, we could have gotten a razorsharp, tightly focused suspense thriller/drama/action movie with minimal dialog and with a high focus on building tension and atmoshpere. Kinda like a crossover between Breaking Bad and Vanishing Point (or think about any great escape movie).However, what we've got instead is a movie with a lot of unnecessary padding and filler. We've got a lot of scenes that while are often good and quite tasteful, they don't really move the story forward in any meaningful way and they don't really deepen the characters any further than we've already seen them on the show. They are just there to extend the run time of the movie, in order to justify it to be a movie in the first place.Expectations can be harmful, however, I'm not actually disappointed because the movie didn't went the way I thought it would. I'm disappointed because I expected a meaningful and memorable movie that will be a worthy continuation and closure to Breaking Bad. But what I've got instead is something that while good enough, at the same time, nearly pointless, and again, it left me with a huge amount of emptiness."

Skinny Pete gave Jesse his hat so that he became less recognizable, however it seemed Jesse didn't agree with him. We saw Jesse most of the time without that hat! Although all he was looking for was running away from ABQ, he didn't give much sth about being recognized! 2. How did Jesse know where was the hidden key of his parents' house?! 3. I thought Brock was the most important person to Jesse! Yes! I know! Ian Posada (actor of this role) has grown and he's not that young, but come on we said nothing about Todd, or maybe we said! But this double standard is not acceptable."

      "text": "Whilst there is a debate for how necessary this film was for the Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul story, there is no doubt that this movie was extremely well made and could work as a stand-alone movie without the assistance of the famous TV shows. Gilligan and Paul have come together to produce something special once again, with an extremely satisfying ending that Jesse most definitely deserved. Even if some cameos may have been there for the shock-value (looking at you Walt), almost each and every character has a purpose in Jesse's story. An extremely well crafted follow-up to the original series."
