The scale of the movie is excellent, set pieces are huge and memorable, the visual feel is tremendous and helps create a genuine atmosphere. With that, the soundtrack by M83 is engrossing and excellent. Tom Cruise plays a solid main role, that didn't sell me at first but did later on, his scenes with Andrea Riseborough are among the best of the film. Add in some unexpected and truly great twists, and I'm happily surprised with this movie and it turns from what I'd expected to be a good movie, to a great one."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Oblivion is a rare beast, at least for Hollywood, it's actually a real science fiction film. While most sci-fi movies are basically guns in space, or other genres wrapped up in futuristic glitter, Oblivion wears it's sci-fi credentials proudly.

It's not only worth checking out, its worth seeing, telling your friends about it and then seeing it again!"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Why didn't i see this in theaters?

Among the Inception and Interstellar the height of effects, visualization and overall impact are reached to the highest limit, tied also to beautiful sounds and songs.

As opposed to some of the other reviewers, I found the plot easy to understand and interesting.  However, the execution in the film left a bit to be desired:  i.e. why didn't the humans inform Jack of his situation when they first met?  why didn't jack's wife tell him who she was immediately?  why did the humans hail the orbiting escape pod from earlier knowing all the people on board would be killed?  how?  why now 60 years later?  The film is littered with these questions (very Prometheus-esque).  So believing it all was a bit of an effort, unfortunately.  ...could have been a much better film.  ...shame."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "An enjoyable sci-fi film, but very derivative and a little antiseptic from an emotional standpoint.   The cinematography was absolutely stunning, and the score is gorgeous (a bit like late-period Kubrik scores).  Movie fans should probably see this movie for these two aspects alone.  As for the story, the basic premise is interesting and believable, but a lot of the touches (like the kid at the end) do not make much sense and really don't contribute to the overall story line or movie quality.  And the twist...well, it's been done...and I'll leave it at that.\r With a better director and some script editing, this could have been a masterpiece.  As it stands, it is a decent movie with stunning visuals and soundtrack."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "It's not all bad, the scenery and special effects were excellent, as were the two female Costars. I was also pleasantly surprised to see the Danish actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who did a good job as a sidekick to Morgan Freeman and has gained recent notoriety in the Game of Thrones show.\rThe bad was that of course we've seen this post-apocalyptic plot regurgitated so many times in a few weeks you will have trouble remembering what stood out about this film.\rFinally, the really ugly is Hollywood's continuous insult to our intelligence when casting lead actors. America is so deeply weary of being reminded Tom Cruise is the most amazing man in the universe... Note to Hollywood: please give Cruise a rest."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Without really being exceptionally amazing, I still found this movie pretty decent.  It certainly did appear to borrow ideas from a lot of my other favorite sci-fi movies, and it didn't always execute the ideas as well as the other films did.  Forgiving that, I still had a fun time."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "While Oblivion is perhaps the worst film I have seen this year thus far, it is still enjoyable and presents us a competent Sci-fi story that feels like it has been pulled from the 1970s full of twists and turns. Sometimes the film feels like its trying to be smarter than it is however, and I have never been too fond of Tom Cruise as an actor. My main complaint of the film however, is that the cinematography at times feels too false and feels like a television programme, while this likely will not be a problem for most people, it cheapened the feel of the film for me and kind of took me out of the experience. The effects are great and you do at least feel something for at least some of the characters throughout the film, although at times it feels like it is just going through the motions. All in all however, the film is enjoyable and the storyline is actually good and makes you think to some extent. Decent, 69/100."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Oblivion is not one of the worst films of the year but it's not great either. The key thing about it is that it doesn't offer anything new as the director Joseph Kosinski said it pays homage to science-fiction films of 1970s. You will say, \"Oh, I've seen it before!\" a lot while watching it. Another problem is the pace of the film, which is extremely slow at the beginning. The plot takes a lot of time to take-off and that's how I found it boring but I forgot it eventually because the final 30-45 minutes of film are good. What's different about it is that it still manages to entertain you a little because it may not be original but the visual experience it gives you is astonishing, especially with Kosinski's vision and the better production value, it feels like the remixed version of all the sci-fi films released in the past. The best things about this film are its landscapes, the brilliant cinematography by none other than Claudio Miranda and the background score by M83 which is extremely wonderful. I am only disappointed because the main theme could've made it much better and a bigger film but that didn't happen. Acting wise, it's alright. Tom Cruise, Morgan Freeman (I wanted to see more of him), Andrea Riseborough, Olga Kurylenko, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Melissa Leo, all of them are good at their roles. In short, the movie didn't waste my time but I can't rate it better than this because Kosinski didn't do justice to it."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "While visually arresting and primed with action-sequences, \"Oblivion\" compromises its technical accomplishments with a disheveled script that helps itself liberally from numerous science fiction films. That being said, that doesn\u2019t mean that much of it\u2019s audience won\u2019t find this fairly engaging and entertaining. Tom Cruise returns to the realms of science fiction, collaborating with director Joseph Kosinski \"Tron: Legacy\" (2010), in a big screen adaptation of his unpublished graphic novel.\r Like a great deal of science fiction films, \u201cOblivion\u201d requires a lengthy prologue in order to contextualize the viewer to the imaginative world they are being introduced to. In this case, that world is actually our own, just not at all like we know it. In 2077, 60 years after an alien invasion triggered a nuclear war that decimated the planet, the human race has all but abandoned Earth for Titan, the largest of Saturn's moons. Tom Cruise plays Jack Harper, one of the last few drone repairmen stationed on an Earth which has been abandoned for years following decades of war with a group known as the Scavs. Along with his wife Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), they maintain the fleet of drones, protecting the earth from the threat of the Scavs. Yet, when a series of drones go down, and a spaceship crashes with a beautiful survivor Julia (Olga Kurylenko) on board, Jack finds his life changed forever as everything he knows, (or thinks he knows), is blown apart.\r \"Oblivion\" is an incredible piece of visual sci-fi eye candy; sleek, a wonderfully realized world of day-after-tomorrow style technology, including some brutally intense fight sequences. It's one of those films that demands it to be watched on the biggest screen you can possibly find. The world \u201cOblivion\u201d paints is certainly a striking one, but the emptiness that now dominates the planet inevitably also permeates throughout the picture itself. This is the underlining problem with \"Oblivion.\" The movie comes off as merely a derivative of other well-done, successful science fiction films. So much creativity went into the visual design that apparently little was left when crafting the plot. The movie liberally borrows from \u201cWALL-E\u201d (2008), \u201cTotal Recall\u201d (1990), \u201cIndependence Day\u201d (1996), \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d (2001), and \u201cMoon\u201d (2009), that it often veers dangerously close into lawsuit territory.\r \"Oblivion\" is admirable in its look and style, but the film is not unique or exceptional. It holds its own as the mystery initially plays out, and you do find yourself drawn in, but as the pieces begin to slot together, you can't help but feel you've seen it all before. Like the drones  and Cruise himself  \u201cOblivion\u201d is competent, durable, and undeniably mechanical."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Oblivion has great audio and visual effects.  Sadly those are the best things within the entire movie.  This movie lacked a good story.  The movie was mainly star-driven.  Tom cruise showed us that even at his age, he could still play a badass.

Perhaps the visual part, the \"atmosphere\", obscures the story and characters, however the story itself is pretty intriguing, and the characters are interesting. Avoidance of the excessive dynamics is an advantage - this is what clearly distinguishes \"Oblivion\" among the modern sci-fi genre, separating the thoughtful viewer from an emotions consumer, and giving to the first one time to reflect, and to the second one time to get bored and disappointed. That, in general, is well. Any true art must be creative expression and have its audience, rather than try to please everyone by sacrificing sincerity and quality. 8 out of 10."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I don't understand how this movie Metascore can be only 54.\rUnoriginal?

Mark my words:  this is the Blade Runner of it's time.  Blade Runner was universally panned by critics, and a dud at the box office.  Today, it's considered one of the greatest SciFi movies of all time.  30 years from now, they'll still be watching Oblivion.  Like Blade, this is ultimately a love story:   a pair of souls separated by time, war and science desperately seeking to reunite.  It is one of Tom Cruise's best performances.  The Icelandic scenery mixed with seamless CGI is stunning and restrained.  The pace seems excruciatingly slow, but is perfect for the situation.  With just a couple of small forgettable flaws in the science, the story is completely believable.  Joseph Kosinski's graphic novel background shows in almost every frame, with perfect shot composition and transition.   I was completely captivated by the mise en scene.  (Look it up, kiddies.)  Forget comments about being \u201cderivative\u201d or \u201cunoriginal\u201d.  That\u2019s the nature of science fiction.  Finally, the M83 soundtrack is so perfect, you don't notice it until the wonderful final credits.  Buy or rent it, and you will watch it over and over again.  Tom & Joseph:  you did good.

It started out very good, almost great, then went down to average about half way through, and ended up as what I would describe as a good sci-fi movie for a sci-fi fan. I would not recommend this to a non-sci-fi fan. The visuals were great; the overall story was good too. It's the execution of the second half of the film that was a let-down, especially after the very well designed set-up of the beginning. I was hoping the story would go one way, but it went another way and it was ok, but I had a better path laid out in my head for the second half of the movie while I was watching it. My opinion is that people who make movies are pressured to make them/keep them simple, with less thought provoking storylines and more pop and flash; stories you can wrap up neatly in a bow at the end. I understand it, some of the dumbest movies I've ever seen, made the most money, and in the end, it's a business. However, in the long run, they will need to start making better, smarter, more thought provoking movies; otherwise they will eventually lose everyone. A great place to do this is with sci-fi movies. There is no reason you can't have action, pop and flash, and a great story."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Despite the fact that the CGI was often quite bad and that the story is clich\u00e9 and predictable, it was still a rather entertaining and fun action/Sci-Fi flick.
