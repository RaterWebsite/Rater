There were reasons behind the slip-up's but at the end of the day it still got chuckles out of me more thanks to the characters and actors in the film rather than the content. This was also the last of the series that the Wayans Brothers worked on, perhaps a good thing as the next two were better than this one, but you can't skip this one when watching the others!"

      "text": "With far better jokes than the original film, and with far more competent spoofing, Scary Movie 2 is worthy of a cursory glance at least. The excellent opening sequence which parodies The Excorcist, and the Charlie's Angels-style fight scene later in the film in particular are worth seeing. Anna Farris returns and makes you smile once more, but the addition of some formidable comedy muscle in the form of the always brilliant Tim Curry as a purvey college professor and Chris Elliot playing the deformed caretaker every haunted house has to have helps to elevate the sequel far above the other films in this often disappointing series. Yes, it's still very crude and often trashy, with obscene amounts of simulated bodily fluids and over-sized rubber rude bits making an appearance, and far too many jokes miss the mark or come across as crass or insulting to some group in society. At least the Wayans look like they've put some effort into making a decent comedy film this time round, though they reportedly felt that this sequel was rushed and lacking in quality. It may not have the wit of Mel Brooks in his heyday, or indeed much evidence of a brain at all, but Scary Movie 2 does have a little Brooks-style anarchic energy, and thankfully this one actually makes you laugh on a pretty regular basis, unlike its predecessor."

Some parodies are really funny (like Titanic, Hannibal or MacGyver) and I laughed at the characters of Henson, Ray Wilkins, Professor Oldman and of course Shorty! It's really funny sometimes but it got way too many scatological jokes and stuff. It's a fun night to have with your bros but as a actual movie it's just not good. Bothersome teenage girls (except the hot Kathleen Robertson!) and a stupid story. But what do you expect of that? As a comedy it's acceptable but compared with all other films that are out there it's not better than a 2."

      "text": "I think that people are way too hard on these movies. It seems to me that the filmakers had a few good jokes they wanted to make and knew they were going to have to fill the time with something other than pure comedy. The jokes that you know they wanted to make were hilarious, and in the end that was all that mattered to me. The thing that surprised me was that certain parts were a bit clever (the weed scene was pretty witty) and the movie actually isn't very horney. I was expecting a sex romp, but there really is no genuinely arousing material to speak of (which is good in my opinion). I also enjoyed the choice of actors in the film, Anna Farris did a GREAT job (I'm still giggling at the mad cow joke), same for the Wayans brothers, Chris Materson and the black girl (though Kathleen Robertson has to be one of the worst actresses I have ever seen). The chemistry worked well for the characters, its just too bad the plot and dialogue weren't all around better. I would have enjoyed the film much more if the background noise had been changed from crudeness to wit and the writers had gotten their plot straight. You can still piece together what they were trying to get at, but I've never seen a movie actually made while the script was still in the drafting stages. One thing that bothered me about the movie was the beginning. I was actually very offended by it and almost turned off the film. It wasn't funny, it was clever, and it was very insulting (the rest of the movie I didn't think was nearly as much so). I feel the film makers simply threw it in to extend the length of the film, bad move on their part."

      "text": "This is where it got downhill for the scary movie film series. They chose the Haunting as base for this spoof movie with good portions of the Exorcist and some Poltergeist (Plus jokes for many more movies). This sounds awesome on paper but the execution ruins the movie. The humor doesn't work as well as in the prequel and many jokes feel like a fake attachment that was added without reason. For me approx 30% of the jokes are funny while I admit that 2 or 3 are really good. I don't have many problems with the actors / acting. For me it is more like good actors trapped in a bad movie or bad writing. So I wont blame them for this. There are rumors that the movie was rushed out as fast as possible to benefit from the success of the prequel. But take this not as fact because I did not find any conformation for this. Overall this is a bad movie with small redeeming qualities (Some jokes are good). It is at least better than the follow ups and I consider it a lost opportunity."

      "text": "This teen film (one of the most abominable cinematographic genres I know) was made to parody some well-known horror films, just as it had happened to the film that preceded it. This time, the most obvious victims are the famous \"The Exorcist\" and \"The Haunting\". I don't know to what extent it was a predictable sequel, but the fact is that it seems to have honored the initial film, even though the formula is not so interesting and is already more difficult to bear.The film is more of a satire on horror films, made to entertain young audiences with easy laughter, eschatological jokes and a thousand of allusions to sexuality, in its several options and variants. Unlike its predecessor, which seemed to me a kind of \"guilty pleasure\", capable of even pleasing those who don't like this type of humor, this film was not so successful: it will almost certainly please everyone who loved the first one film, but the same is not guaranteed for audiences that are already more demanding with the humor they consume, or who have a loathing for \"teen\" films. The reason for this is simple: it is not as fresh, nor as funny as the first film, and there are lots of perfectly boring or predictable jokes.The cast is again led by Anna Faris, again in the shoes of Cindy, and she does as good a job as in the first film except that it's not as fresh or brings anything really new, and sometimes the character was overly sexualized, the that removed the stupid na\u00efvet\u00e9 that made her funny. Another actress who is returning is Regina Hall, but she manages to be even more funny and iconoclastic than in the first film. Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans keep the same record with less interesting results. Tori Spelling does not bring anything special or interesting. Kathleen Robertson is a walking pair of breasts and Tim Curry isn't funny at all."
