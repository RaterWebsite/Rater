It a decent stand alone movie but as the major key role of MCU next phrase this movie is a failure, lazy script, soulless acting and funny 10 years old logic, one the worst MCU introduction movie so far."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "A bit of a mixed bag really, this doesn't seem like an MCU film, the tone of it was out of whack, something reminiscent of Green Lantern but better. There seems to be some inconsistencies with the rest of the MCU films but will have to check them out to confirm. I struggled to enjoy this film even the jokes were misplaced as evident by the rest of the cinema not engaging either. I love any fantasy, sci fi spectacle but this fell short and couldn't keep me engaged. I think Brie Larson was miss cast in this role, I know she's a great actor but I think she does better in more dramatic roles, she was totally unconvincing as Captain Marvel and I struggled to invest in the character. Carol's relationship with Maria was difficult to accept or believe, there seemed to be no chemistry or emotional investment between them. I think Charlize Theron would have made a better Captain Marvel, she has the stature and gravitas that is required to bring the character to life.Sam l Jackson was great as Nick Fury but what is the MCU without him, he seems to carry most of the film for me. However, the digital de-ageing was a bit hit and miss, sometimes it looked good but at other times it didn't even look like him at all which took me out of the moment on a few occasions.Ben Mendelsohn was another highlight, he played the antagonist beautifully with a great menacing quality, the depth and believability of his character showed in spades.The CGI again was also hit and miss, for the most part it was OK, not great. At times it was like watching a well rendered cut scene for a AAA PC game and other times, cartoon like, as I mentioned earlier it reminded me of Green Lantern.This film was marketed as a feminist film fighting sexism (and Aliens), did this reflect the sexism of the 90's? At the time I was at UNI studying \"Social Theory and Communications\", basically a liberal left viewpoint and a big part of the course involved media manipulation, prejudice, sexism and critical theory so I was quite sensitive to any form of sexism. This film was more like sexism from the 80's where the older generation were still living in the world influenced by the 50's and 60's and were still using the phrases like \"Smile, it may never happen\" or \"Cheer up\". In essence Carol throwing off the shackles of patriarchy actually belonged in that time as by the end of the 90's, in the UK at least, equality was ingrained into society so status, rights, and opportunities between the sexes was on a level playing field."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Weakest Marvel film since pre Iron man. Waste of money and time and has made me completely disinterested in End game. Lord I hope they don't follow through with having Captain Marvel finishing Thanos or I'm done with the MCU and they can say goodbye to my money. I'm the lead up to release I thought the haters were just trying to get back at the actress for her comments but they were correct  her character is uninteresting, her acting is abysmal, she has zero charisma and is extremely unlikable on screen. The film might have worked if The casting cerew had gotten the role right. If they want to continue with this character and have her effect the MCU going forward she needs to be recast or cut entirely."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "The movie is boring and mundane.

The things that bothered me was that Captain Marvel felt more like a Phase 1 film and didn't meet my expectation especially after the incident of Infinity War. This movie felt like it should have been released 10 years ago rather than now. Brie Larson as Captain Marvel didn't show much emotion or expression making me feel distant from her as a person and not easily likeable. Captain Marvel also reached the level of invinciblity at the end of the movie and I was not quite able to relate to the character. Other superheroes like Ironman and Captain America had flaws which every regular human can relate to but not with Captain Marvel.Overall, it was a pretty average movie making this movie the third worst Marvel movie after Thor the Dark World and The Incredible Hulk."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "It was very plain sometimes boring even.

Brie Larson acts like a Cardbord cutout, and the Character has no arc. It is not interesting to see an orgin story with not seeing the Character grow.

Without a reason or purpose for existing one is left asking...other than explaining pointless MCU plot points and creating a plethora of fresh plot holes...why was this movie made and who was it made for?

She has to play a Mary Sue, so there's no compelling tension to her character. She's a total bore. Watching her character arc is like watching paint dry.

It's about how Captain Marvel is about to ruin Avengers: Endgame, more's the pity. Oh, and don't waste your time writing a review on Rotten Tomatoes.  They are publishing some negative audience reviews, but they're filtering out a good percentage of them in order to keep the score from plummeting too low. For shame, RT. You are rotten."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "I thought Brie Larson would be the worst part of the movie based upon her acting in the movie clips and trailers. But I think the writing out stunk her performance. Yes, Larson was terrible. She has no unique style or charisma and is quite bland and not worthy to headline a big budget movie that needs the audience to actually care about her character. The combination of misguided, amateur writing, and Larson's bizarre acting, made the Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel character seem like a hollow, impossible to relate to robot. And that's saying something when it took Anthony Daniels like 2 minutes to make C3P0 interesting in Star Wars A New Hope. Even the radio controlled R2D2 was a more sympathetic character than Captain Marvel.Yeah, I know Larson is getting bashed harshly, but I'm not going easy on the critique because of that. She was playing a heroine, but came across like Sean Young's Blade Runner replicant or Kristanna Loken's T-X from Terminator: Rise Of The Machines. As I watched the movie, I couldn't stop looking at Larson like I would a car wreck. It was surreal and creepy. I'm not familiar with her acting but surely she does not act like that in every movie. But as I said, the story and all of it's many bad ideas was the worst thing about the movie. Marvel & the writers made their first misstep by setting it in the 90s all so they could retcon the MCU's past and make Danvers the first Avenger. The movie seemed to drag forever and contrary to reports...NO ONE SHINED IN THIS MOVIE!! Sam Jackson's Nick Fury was supposed to be younger but he seemed like a tired old man. Clark Gregg should have been used better. The bits with the cat were one of the worst things in any movie, EVER! The finale was like watching Superman VS The Riddler. I can't even call that a final fight. I am amazed that Marvel would make such a bad movie, even though Doctor Strange, Spider-Man Homecoming and both Ant-Man movies were flat lined bores. Infinity War was vastly overrated. But Captain Marvel....so bad it's possibly worse than Iron Man 2 and Thor 2."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Boooring.  The lead actor, Brie Larson is a terrible, uncharismatic super-hero.

I was so bored during this movie.  By the time the pace FINALLY picked back up near the end, it was too little too late.   This entirely forgettable entry into this massive film franchise is completely skippable.  You won't need to see this to understand what's going on in Endgame.  Yes, there will be this new Captain Marvel character in Endgame, but all you really need to know is that she existed back in the 90's and finds her way back to the action \"in the nick of time\" once Endgame rolls around.  One thing to note:  Your experience of the MCU as a whole may be lessened if you see this movie or accept this movie as canon.  They literally retconned Captain Marvel as the BEGINNING of the Avengers, as well as the battle for control of a certain macguffin that was central to phase 1 marvel's climax.  They also introduce a plotline where there's little reason for the Kree to have largely ignored Earth all this time since the 90's.  This is a pretty big plothole.How does this rank compared to the rest of the MCU?  It's right at the bottom; near but below Thor the Dark World and Iron Man 2.

The Captain Marvel origin story is pretty good. Some of the acting was good. The special effects were good. The cat was great.The Bad: The pacing of the movie is off (especially at the beginning). Too much story crammed into only a 2h 4m movie. Tons of expositions. The forced puns and jokes aren't funny (no one in the theater laughed at the obvious attempt). Bre Larsen's acting is mediocre and her range is lack-luster. The writing is kinda sketchy and bad in places (especially on WHY Captain Marvel is so over-powered and nigh God-like). The plot seems oddly familiar -- certain scenes are exceptionally reminiscent of Captain America. Captain Marvel has ZERO weaknesses -- at no point during the film do you feel or sense that Captain Marvel/Carol Danvers is in any danger.
