      "text": "The animation is ugly to the point of disturbing, a simple and predictable narrative structure. I honestly didn't see any difference between the animation of this film, animation 10 years ago, a CUTSCENE of PS3. In the narrative question one can compare with any animated 3D series of children's channels made to fill schedule and pluck money with toys."
