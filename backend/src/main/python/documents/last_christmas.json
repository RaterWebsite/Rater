      "text": "Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding are great together (Clarke is a very talented comedic actress and Golding is as charming as ever) and the premise at the core of their characters\u2019 story is genuinely interesting. But the film that surrounds them does them a great disservice \u2014 it\u2019s a messy, tonally uneven patchwork of corniness and poor writing that has no direction. The film never seems to land on what it wants to be, throwing ideas and random, badly connected storylines onto the canvas. If it had merely focused on Clarke and Golding, it just might have executed the main premise that much better. It\u2019s too bad - with the right editing and writing, this could have worked."

She wanted a tropey romance and I wanted to watch Emilia Clarke do that quirky/funny/charming thing that she does so well. Mission accomplished on both parts."

I didn't like the big twist at first, but after some thinking I think it can work. I'm not completely sure how I feel about it. Lovely movie with a great cast."

I wasn't sure about the movie at first because it wasn't what I expected, but by the end of the film, it became one of my very favorites of the year. This movie made me want to be a better person and be happy that I'm alive. I can't recommend it enough."

Let's get the negatives out of the way first: the first half of the movie is pretty dull and mediocre, the music doesn't always fit the scene, the comedy is more miss than hit and the movie is full of cliches. These didn't bother me that much but they are noticeable. The positives on the other hand are: Emilia Clarke is fantastic as always and she has an amazing singing voice, the acting is really good, the \"twist\" of the movie was unexpected and very sad and effective, the song \"last Christmas\" is beautiful and the ending is heartfelt, sorrow and satisfying. I really liked the twist and the final scenes of the movie. The movie is emotional and has great character moments, most of them are with Emilia's and Henry's characters. Yes it made me cry and i really like this movie. In conclusion the first half is not that great but the second is better. I will definitely make this movie my own Christmas tradition in that i will watch it every Christmas."

I laughed a fair bit more than I thought I would, and I loved the acting/pacing. It isn't going to break any new ground overall, but if you are looking for a movie with some tear jerking moments, some laughs, and an overall enjoyable time I don't think you would be disappointed here!"

      "text": "Emilia Clarke enchants with her bright smile as a woman who's sweetly struggling with her life. She works in a Christmas store, auditions for parts and goes from friend to family for a place to sleep. One day she meets an appealing man (Henry Golding) who helps her find herself. What seems like a sweet, but not especially special romantic comedy does manage to turn things around before it's over. Screenwriter Emma Thompson has fashioned a mildly cute comedy, but none of the characters are especially memorable (except her own role as the Hungarian mother). Director Paul Feig has kept it seasonably bright, but doesn't add much comic charm. While not without appeal (and a soundtrack featuring the songs of George Michael), this might warm hearts seeking a holiday trifle."

As a Christmas movie, this is definitely one of the top, with a sweet and powerful message about loving oneself, and learning to love what you have in the moment and share it with others. All about perspective, and a positive movie to watch with either a loved one or by yourself. It's nice to see that Christmas movies don't always have to involve romance, or the magic of Santa."

      "text": "Last Christmas. Take a second chance. A stunning, gorgeous and magical Christmas comedy starring the charming and funny Emilia Clarke. First of all, I also want to highlight the music, and it is the real legacy of the great George Michael. The atmosphere of Christmas in the film is conveyed perfectly, and this is the scenery and landscape views of the city. The chemistry between the characters Kate and Tom is also excellent. This is one of those films where each character is remembered and if, for example, you remove him, then the movie loses a piece of itself. There will be no spoiler, but this film literally hits you at some point with its unexpected turn and you are left in a pleasant shock from this, but then you realize that this very turn throughout the entire film was practically on the surface."

      "text": "A problem that I couldn't get out of my head is that Emilia Clarke shows few skills for change and her character here feels like an extension of Louisa Clark but a lot more cynical and less cheerful.And it's ironic that a film in which the main character is looking to recover the joy in life lacks of spirit.It helps a lot the chemistry between Clarke and Henry Golding but that's just the most salvageable element here. The rest is too generic and you can infer the narrative twist with astonishing speed.Even since the trailers you could see it and that was a fatal blow to the film.It was forgettable, even for the christmas season."

This one is yet another of those so-called Christmas \u2018holiday season \u2018movies that are as much about Christmas as that Bonny Bouncing Bunny is to Easter. It\u2019s somewhat of a \u2018La La Land\u2019 wanna-be, without the easygoing feel and charm that one at least offered. Some of the dialogue and situations are crass and the sleep-around, female \u2018Christmas Elf\u2019\u2019, didn\u2019t help whatsoever. This thankless girl is actually cared for \u2013 but does she deserve it? The sudden turn to being a supernatural feel good/bad fantasy surprise --was a bit of a difficult twist to take-- especially amongst all the rather superficial PC philosophising being shovelled around like the fake \u2018santa\u2019 snow in the gutters of ole London.  The cast tried but with the sour- treacle script reaching for heights it didn\u2019t quite earn, it was mostly uphill.Maybe fine for the easily pleased or woke \u2018idealists\u2019. A movie based on a song, with other songs in the background that didn\u2019t quite fit the subject."

Leaping from friend\u2019s various sofas onto many an audience member\u2019s Christmas party list, the awkward smiley demeanour of Emilia Clarke\u2019s Kate works wonders as she lumbers from one questionable decision to the next, showing a willingness to be better. When not twirling around the streets, he\u2019s giving us a cheeky impression of James Bond. It\u2019s an endlessly charming turn from Henry Golding as Tom, with the initial mystery subsiding quickly as he strikes up a brilliant chemistry with Clarke. Arguably the film\u2019s strongest performer however is Michelle Yeoh, who revels in the quirk of her character\u2019s subplot, raising many hearty laughs in the process.Sure, it\u2019s unashamedly soppy and it\u2019s not quite Flawless. But Paul Feig\u2019s \u2018Last Christmas\u2019 will make you want to Go To The City. A fantastically festive treat."

If anything, each twist is a relaunch towards more presumptuous and unjustified ambitions. A graceless though successful film."

      "text": "A Christmas movie that doesn't have many Christmas features. The Christmas tree, Santa Claus and Christmas ornaments are all in the background in the story. Its normal to expect the same story in theaters at this time of year and that is what makes this film - not stand out - but different from the rest.The characters in the film are quite eccentric and none of them escapes this adjective. Michelle Yeoh and Emma Thompson have the strangest characters - in a good way - from the plot of the film. A Christmas store attendant with peculiar tastes and who has a romantic and secondary plot with the character of Peter Mygind, who can possibly get some laughs from the audience. And a mother from a broken family who is very protective of one of her daughters and is very afraid of being deported to her country of origin. Lydia Leonard's character has a small plot that I could call a dramatic and essential background, but it just stays there.Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding for being the protagonists, are the ones that stand out the most in the film. As stated before, none of the characters shy away from the adjective eccentric and strange. Emilia Clarke puts her essence of romantic comedy characters here and manages to be funny without being forced, possibly captivating the audience with the situations that surround her created by the script and is mentally messy. This all makes us want to follow its history and learn more about it. In the case of Henry Golding, they make up a very correct character and who possibly does not make many mistakes in his life. That's what makes the character weird.What may have surprised me in the entire film was its ending. It can be a little predictable if we think a little more outside the box and take the idea a little more than half of the film. In this case, it didn't happen to me. I was surprised and a little sad by the situation.The film is full of imperfections, such as the little importance they give to the dramatic background of some characters, but it is full of fun scenes that make your heart warm when you see them."

While I was never a fan of George Michael, I absolutely loved how the words and music was woven into the script. I have never seen an episode of Game of Thrones, and was totally unfamiliar with the actors in this movie - maybe that was a good thing, as I avoided any prejudices other reviewers might have. But the connection between the two main actors, Kate and Tom, was powerful. Overall, the movie was quite moving, and that's what I'm looking for - something that gives me hope and inspiration.I rented this movie on a whim - I did not watch the trailer, and I'm glad I didn't. I knew nothing about the plot, although now looking back after having watched this movie about 50 times (okay, actually I've only watched the last ten minutes probably 49 of those times!), I probably should have seen it coming.  But I didn't.  And it hit me harder than any other movie I've watched in recent memory.  And every time I watch it, it still does.This is not your typical Christmas movie.  I wouldn't even describe it as a comedy.  But it is true romance.  Watch it and decide for yourself."

Until she meets Tom by surprise and further on in the movie Kate feels different being around Tom and she feels like she is alive. She shares a very emotional story where her heart stopped working and that she needed a transplant. She reveals a very personal story that has affected her very badly but it is almost like Tom has made her feel better.But further on in the movie she then finds out who is Tom. This is an extremely emotional film in the end but is funny and some parts of the movie may be a bit wierd at the start if watching with a family. Enjoy its a great movie to watch in Christmas."
