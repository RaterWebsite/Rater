A cop's daughter, Nancy Thompson, traces the cause to child molester Fred Krueger, who was burned alive by angry parents many years before. Krueger has now come back in the dreams of his killers' children, claiming their lives as his revenge. Nancy and her boyfriend, Glen, must devise a plan to lure the monster out of the realm of nightmares and into the real world...",

I love how they robbed scenes from the originals (bloody body in a bag in the school hallway, Nancy's name and mother's fate, the blond bombshell/bad boy cuddling then she dies all around the room and him in jail) I thought to was supposed to be a remake, not a 'hijack-and-puke' fest. I love the breaking of the paper cutter just like in the Faculty too! If there is ANYTHING \"good\" about this movie, it gave us plenty of not-fully-related-to-the-plot images at why pedophiles should be burned alive."

      "text": "What we have here is a rare surprise; a remake that actually provides a solid twist on the original. Obviously it doesn't live up to Wes Craven's horror classic, but there's plenty to enjoy here for any fans of Freddy Krueger. That's because Jackie Earle Haley does a fantastic job as the character.\r Sure, he's no Robert Englund, but Haley gives an excellent performance with this slightly new take on the character. His one-liners are on point and he's just the right amount of creepy. He reminded me why I found the character so fascinating in the first place, and why I fell in love with the original series.\r I also have to give the movie props for at least trying to be a serious horror movie. Yeah there are some self-aware funny moments here and there, but it certainly does try to scare you. Unfortunately it does not succeed. The jump scares are predictable and there's nothing here to instill fright. It thankfully manages to avoid turning Freddy into the comical villain some of the later sequels turned him into, but the movie's overreliance on modern horror movie scare tactics that just don't work prevent it from actually being scary. You don't come into this movie looking for frights. You come for the Krueger character and the twist on his fiction.\r There are plenty of homages to the original here. It follows roughly the same path and there are plenty of new takes on classic scenes. The real change up comes from Freddy's backstory. This time around the movie isn't afraid to shy away from the pedophilic elements that were only hinted at in the original. It's (thankfully) not very graphic with these elements, but it's no secret what's going on.\r Ultimately where the story stumbles is in that none of the characters outside of Freddy are really fleshed out. The parents are just sort of there, and Nancy (Rooney Mara) and Quentin (Kyle Gallner) are the only two teens who get any real screen time. The others are just there to add to the body count. Even with that though we never really get to learn much about them. The characterization falls short.\r Still though as a huge fan of most of the original movies I can't find too much that I dislike here. It may be lacking scares and the non-Freddy characters are flat, but when it comes to a new take on one of my favorite characters in all of cinema the movie delivers. Freddy is what attracted me to the series in the first movie. To see him handled well here makes me happy, even if the rest of the film around him doesn't fare so well. I would love to see Haley take up the role again. It's certainly a lot better than most of the sequels to the original."

I love Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy, even if he isnt England (the original Freddy) he is a good actor and worth of the part. The rest of the actors were good as well. There are also a few original parts in there that actually work rather well and I enjoyed them.\r The bad parts of the film - The kills were exactly like the original film and like the ending of Freddy vs Jason. I hated that, I wanted original kills that were worthy of Freddy's style, Not some poorly done \"reimagining\" of the original film's kills. Also the actresses in this film were terrible and ruin the film quite a bit, Rooney Mara was a terrible lead (and actress imo) who killed this film.\r I am a long time fan of the Nightmare on Elm Street series and in my opinion, This is one of the best films the franchise has come out with. I liked it enough where I would give the sequel a chance but I wont see it unless they cast a new female lead."

The original has now been put on such a high pedestal that everyone has forgotten all of its flaws. This movie is cursed with having to fill extremely large shoes that I doubt anyone could fill. Jackie Earle Haley is no where near as good as Robert Englund, but doesn't do a bad job either, Englund did have 7 movies to get it right after all. Overall: I think this is a great film and I really hope they continue with the series, I just hope that they listen to the fans a bit more for the next film."

The visuals were impressive which I expect because Michael Bay is involved in this one. The origin of Freddy was very well explained too.

In the original he was a killer who invaded people dreams to murder them and despite still doing that in this movie it just doesn't have the same effect. Freddie, in the original, had a sick sense of humor and was even able to turn his kills into entertainment via the ability to shape shift and do anything he wanted within his victims dreams but in this villain Freddie is simply a stereotypical slasher. This movie has ruined a once credible character."

His single 3 word statement tells me he didnt watch it, or really wasn't in the mood and shouldnt have watched it.   I grew up during the Jason and Freddie era. I was terrified as a child and amused as a teenager. The first movie I ever went to at night without my parents  and instead with my friends was Friday the 13th part 3 in 3-d.    So I believe I understand the attachment and fondness our generation has for these films very well. With that said I thought that  Jackie Earle Haley brought depth to Freddie that was hair raising. It gave me the shivers and I was scared all over again.  So dont believe the critics just because they gave an opinion.    Take my advice and be confident that you wont be wasting your time with this film. Then form your own opinion. :)"

But even tho this movie yes has its many flaws which are pretty much made up by the end of the film this movie maybe Confusing and you may get lost at times .. By the very scary witty outright genius performance that Haley gives as the Very Burned and Disturbed Fred Kruger a Gardner from an Old pre-school!. This movie is cliched and yes you know when the jumps are gonna be tumbling at you.. and when i jump like i did thats when you know this movie is allright!.\r The movie starts out with the Twilight Hunk everyone at which is probably going to see this movie Kellan Lutz Who playes Dean i wish i could tell you more about this character but he is killed off within the first 5mins so i cant really tell you anything ... well he is in a Diner the Springwood Diner where he awakes to nothingness and is started to get a little curious he stumbles to the back in the kitchen to find the Clawed Freddy Kruger!.. But i think i will let you see the movie to let you find out how this happens.\r At the funeral long time friend of Dean, Nancy played what is kind of like a young Emily Blunt played pretty good by (Rooney Mara) well after Deans death she is starting to see a strange man in her dreams who is burnt to a crisp basically to say hes name which you all no him buy FREDDY! why he is killing these teens one by one no one knows. But when the unsuspecting teens fall asleep they fall into a world at which they cant control.. and at this point your in Freddy's world! where your pretty much dead as soon as you fall asleep.\r But as the original Freddy always dead Freddy loved to play with his victims minds before he kills him thats when we finally get a glimpse at this Finger-clawed FREDDY played i think as a very well choice Jackie Earl Haley!. You would maybe think he is not the best choice for Freddy Kruger but honestly if i had to pick someone i would Pick Jackie i mean he is so immersed into this burned Psychopath you really cant go wrong. Soon after another teen and another teen are knocked off the chopping Block!.\r Freddy begins getting closer and closer to finding what he wants hes favorite little girl Nancy. But Freddy keeping them up all the time pretty soon you have to get tired am i corrected? Yes sooner or later they all fall asleep... After 70 hrs of non-sleep your body begins to break down and you experience these little things called Micro-Naps where pretty much your whole body is sleeping and you dont even know it thats when Freddy can get you at your most vulnerable point!.\r This movie does have alot of scenes you know where the Music level rises about a third and you get this Huge BLAST! .. of sound waves in the theater well shockingly enough that worked for me i was genuinely surprise at the fact ... you pretty much know when one thing is gonna pop out and well that kind of takes away from the fun of going to a horror film but it WORKS! .. There really is no PLOT twist here except the fact is if you have seen the original you know what to expect.\r Once again i am going to give credit to Jackie Earl Haley at giving one Hell of a performance here i was really immersed into this guy Fred Kruger the Flashback scenes actually when you dont that he is the way he is you kind of fell sad and lonely for this character but than you find out all the horrible stuff he did and you just feel like wow cant believe i felt sorry for this jerk.\r Seeing this movie did bring back some memories of the very first one.. this movie in no way shape or form lives up to the horror classic that is Nightmare on Elm st. But i wish Wes Craven would have had more involvement in this film than he did .. but i guess hes busy planning Scream 4 which i cant wait for. But when all is said and done you are going to be glad you went and Saw a Nightmare on Elm Street! .. 1...2... Freddy's Coming for you!

I wouldnt say im dissapointed. I got what i came for. But for what it couldve been its not quite up to the level that i think the FT13th remake was. Also. Why did they turn Kruger into Vorhees. What separated Kruger from the other killers is that his kills were VERY over the top with themes and ironic twists. In this one, people get stabbed to death. and from what i can remember, there was only 1 quip. I also find it disapointing how an attempt at referecing two kills from the original NOES movie result in two people dying in the SAME way as the original characters. Very unoriginal.

It's still a somewhat interesting movie that might be worth a rental, but characters are so cliche and their development is so abysmal that you might end up rooting for the villain by the time the credits roll."

      "text": "I am not a fan of the original  \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" in fact I did not like it much at all  mostly due to the fact that for a movie with it's reputation it lacked everything a great horror film  needs it just fell flat when I needed it to soar. Sometime in mid to late '09, I started hearing rumors that New Line Cinema was looking to reboot the famed Nightmare on Elm Street franchise but then I had not seen the original so I had no interest in watching the remake. Well after much speculation and some minor hype for this film   I sat down to see the much talked about remake to the popular 1984 slasher film. Little did I know that I was in for a treat and a sour disappointment? Samuel Bayer's (another music video director trying to make it big) \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\"  was not the nightmare  I had hoped for  it lacked depth of character and  enough twist and turns to really  be called  a  true horror film instead it comes off as a two bit  SyFy channel \"horror\" film. That comes complete with hooky dialogue, extremely poor acting,   predictability on a scale so high that you almost want to laugh at this films expense and trust me when I say this, you will! The \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" remake makes the original and other horror remakes (The Ring, The Crazies)   look so good in comparison.   Samuel Bayer's \u00e2"
