How the plot plays out is actually extraordinary - it turns out THIS is the way into a would-be lover's heart... who knew?! It's crazy.

It glorifies stalking, rape, kidnapping and Stockholm syndrome. The scenes, the soundtrack's terrible.disguised as a \"romance\".Description of the film as I see it:So, the first three minutes we are forced / allegedly to sympathize with a privileged mafia family, where the father is currently negotiating and building a relationship with human traffickers, dealing with girls under the age of 12.So the main character uses his power to exploit other people, blackmail them due to sexual preferences, whatever ... willing to ruin families, and live whatever it takes to achieve his goal.When something goes against him in life, he turns to exploit the closest woman and sexually abuse her (using his influence of power).This after 13 minutesThe main character is crazy and traumatized after the father's death, and he becomes obsessed with the last woman he saw before his father died and almost him. So he kidnaps this woman, and then he treats Stockholm, brainwashing syndrome ...Then he starts sexually harassing here, while saying he won't, and threatening here if he doesn't comply.Scene in hostage scene tied up, he obviously could easily get out of those ropes xD Why does a kidnapped abused girl feel threatened in his life, smile and seem to like the situation?I get she wants to  buy large quantities to piss him off,  but why sexy lingerie?So among other sexual abuse this movie promotes the idea that  you can do whatever you want with a woman that's tied up, if you THINK she likes it. Blowjob scene being in front of her. I show you what you are missing, 30 seconds later it runs in the mouth of a prostitute.So the only one that is alowed to take advantage and **** her - is him, legitimateHe \"saved\" her while she almost died running away from himThe whole final sex thing is very anticlimax, ordinary and boring, with no foreplay, teasing or buildup ...So, obviously, this woman is very superficial. No deep feelings or meaning are needed as long as you have an extravagant lifestyle30 seconds before he comes? no pleasing  the woman her? (yes the ultimate sexy dream)You don't need 365 days ... love ... consumption, extravagant lifestyle and cheap domination sex, playing brat ... playing games ... This is what she loved ...She doesn't even know him.I hate constant games, a false personality ...And then wtf ????She dies pregnant ...What is the point of this movie? Dreaming of fancy things and being used for sex? (and obviously not very good sex), before it's too late and you're dead."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "The acting was horrendous by both actors, especially the lead female.

I found myself constantly checking how much time is left. It\u2019s so boring because the story takes a backseat to the sex scenes which in themselves are poorly shot, undeserved, and cringy. The plot takes such a backseat that I honestly don\u2019t know what exactly happened except that the guy kidnaps the girl and that\u2019s it.

He abducts her, and tells her that he will do everything in his power to make her fall in love with him within 365 days. If he fails, he will admit defeat and release her.The trick is that this man, being a gangster by trade, is used to take everything by force, he's 6\"2 (1.90cm), he has a body that looks as though he's been sculpted by Zeus himself, and even though he is very sophisticated, charismatic, wealthy, and very much of an alpha male, he also can be a little rough around the edges when it comes to intersexual relationships.The woman, portrayed by Anna Maria Sieklucka, is of course impossibly beautiful, and sports nothing less than the perfect body and the perfect face. She can have quite a temper, be provokative and very much disobedient. She also is very smart.The combination of the 2 of course makes for a very explosive relationship (initially) and a lot of funny moments.Now, what i found quite remarkable is the way it approaches the relationship dynamics, which is very unapologetic in the way it portrays on one side the man being extremely powerful, dominant, ruthless, but also deeply charismatic, kind and caring... and on the other side the woman being physically very weak, at the man's mercy, very much submitted to him and upset to find herself in that situation, but at the same time intrigued about him, and in conflict with her own feelings: should she allow herself to fall for him, should she resist....In this movie, you will NOT find any self entitled and self obsessed, arrogant, condescending, petulant, and deluded western women who can only complain about 'Where did all the good men go', not realizing that they're the N\u00b01 reason why no men want to have anything to do with them. You will NOT find any self proclaimed 'strong and independant woman' who is affected so much by the Schrodinger syndrome that she will abuse her victim status every time she feels it's convenient, again not realizing the cringe inducing paradox and the reason why she is in reality anything but strong and independant.This movie absolutely and utterly goes away with that kind of brainwashed women, deluded and miserable. Instead it goes back to the true inner woman's nature and their desire : the need for a powerful, strong, reliable, dominant and capable male. The need to submit and feel loved and protected. The need to let go and let herself be lead.This movie tells you a secret about women that today's society fiercly tries to hide by any means : in their heart of hearts, women crave a relationship like this. It is in fact more than a craving, it is a deep viceral need.If anything, this movie is about a woman who learns to abandon the teachings of a western society gone wrong, a society that would want to see women equal to men in every way, despite all their differences : in biology, needs, nature....And if indeed men and women should have the same rights in front of the law, they are anything but equal when it comes to intersexual relationships. Instead, they are complementary.Let me say that again : NOT equal, but complementary.This movie perfectly reflects that. This is why it is so refreshing. It is void of all feminist **** or leftist activism.All in all, that kind of movie is really not my usual choice, but i was pleasantly surprised and entertained. I enjoyed watching the woman slowly falling in love with the gangster, and him in return learning to express his inner kindness and be more civilized towards her.The acting was ok, but nothing fantastic either, so i won't watch it twice for sure, but it was good enough while it lasted."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "The worst movie I have ever watched.
