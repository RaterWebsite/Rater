This sequel is even cheesier. We get goofier performances, worse dialog, and uglier special effects. The plot goes into a bunch of mystical mumbo jumbo.

Just like the first movie it's strength is in watching the game characters fight each other with over-the-top action. These fights are backed up by an awesome soundtrack.\r It tries to go bigger than it's predecessor and ends up falling short as a result. It also gets quite a bit cheesier. However when it's focusing on the first movie's strengths (cheesy martial arts action with fan favorite MK characters) it's still pretty entertaining. The expanded roster of characters taken from the games still makes it worth a watch for fans of the series and of the first movie.

You only need to see the first few scenes to get all warning signs. They replaced many actors immediately (or the others left in terror;-). Raiden is the most apparent example. Its like you replaced Dirk Nowitzki with Bernie Sanders without any remarks (Visually not Basketball related. I must admit that this idea would be interesting in real life). Then there is the story and acting. While the former movie got the right balance of seriousness and taking itself not too serious, this movie fails. There are a lot of scenes / stuff that should be engaging. But it is pointless, an under-performance or unintentionally hilarious. I don't blame the actors. Even the best actors /actress cant get much out of an awful script or a bad role. What troubles me the most are the sparks of good ideas in this movie. With adaptations and improvements you could make a better or even good movie out of the setting and some ideas. Then there are the fights. While I admit that the final confrontation is engaging the total performance is disappointing. It is sadly not even \u201cSo bad that it is good\u201d. That would at least improve the rating.

I think I could choreograph better action and the special effects are the worst that have ever existed. There is literally a  scene where both the protagonist and the antagonist turn into claymation dragons that fight each other. Robot Chicken has higher quality stop motion animation than this movie. All the actors from the beginning were strapped to wires, as everyone is just unrealistic flying and punching through the air in a way that would only make Joel Schumacher proud.
