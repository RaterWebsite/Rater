      "text": "The long-awaited sequel to Top Gun has apparently already been made; it is titled \"Days of Thunder\". Essentially, Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell has become Cole Trickle and a NASCAR driver. That is honestly the only difference between the two films. As such, this one is incredibly enjoyable. The racing scenes are intense and very well done. The characters, much like Top Gun, are enjoyable and though quite generic, they are pretty well put together. But, sure, the similarities to Top Gun do hurt it because they did just take the same plotlines and re-do them, but since Top Gun is absolutely hysterical and over-the-top enjoyable, so is Days of Thunder. Plus, even as a non-NASCAR fan, I truly believe it was a great portrayal of racing and racers. For that, Days of Thunder is nowhere near as bad as many say it is, rather it is a very good popcorn flick that entertains in spades."

      "text": "I enjoyed watching this movie, it felt like top gun on wheels, the lighting in some of the scenes was vary well orchestrated in this movie, especially in the garage scenes love to see the shadows and effects of the light through the fans, the music from Hans Zimmer is pretty well done as well, there is some flaws with the movie, but the acting from tom cruise, Robert Duvall, Randy Quaid, is pretty solid, I thought Nicole Kidmans accent was not fooling anyone, but honestly the movie was fairly entertaining to watch the story was well put together."

Involontairement ou pas, le film a rat\u00e9 sa vocation de com\u00e9die satirique, seule voie de sortie n\u00e9gociable pour se r\u00e9tamer dans le premier degr\u00e9 au ras du bitume."

Ebert wrote a hilarious review including a template for Tom Cruise, including the wise older woman and an arena to grow in, awesome.  This movie had more corn than a large with extra butter.  I could not make 20 minutes it was just too much."

      "text": "a big chunk of mess..Days of ThunderScott's race track leads to nothing but a brutal accident that is occurred because of the driver itself. It had a linear lane to follow and yet it still somehow managed to go off the track for the most part of the feature. It is a misconceived act. This is a big chunk of mess. And it's not that it couldn't have been repaired, it's just that the storyline itself was dull enough to rot out the emotions, it never had the chance. Despite of being an exhilarating and nail biting sport, the feature isn't cinematic at all. The chills and thrills that you hope that you are about to receive, even that too is in shortage.It is eerily shot with confused amateur cheesy camera work that looks like a cheap television movie that wasn't funded properly. As far as narration is concerned, it is poorly crafted and loosely constructed for it to stand on any whatsoever ground. On terms of performance, the actors aren't given that much room and the ones that are given, aren't sensible enough for them to be convincing. Cruise that as usual loves to be on the driver's seat, this time feels weak since he isn't focused on his own track. The supporting cast like Kidman, Duvall and Rooker, too fails miserably on holding on to their characters.Daft editing and Towne's benign and questionable screenplay works like anchor and undermines the somewhat decent, even though familiar, concept. Scott's execution also deserve to be put on stand in here, his fatal attempts of delivering a highly pitched dramatic concept seems obvious since he fails to shot even a normal conversation, it is inedible and uncomfortable. Days Of Thunder is long, hard and hectic days, these are the days that not only audience wishes it to go away, but by the end, makers and actors too are on the same boat."
