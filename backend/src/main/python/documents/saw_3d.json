      "text": "Saw 3D is (for the most part) poorly scripted, laughably acted and wears it's low budget like a badge of honor. The one thing it has going for it is a killer of a twist ending, which does nicely wrap up the series, but which I also think has blinded some of the others users on here into thinking they saw a really great film (eg, mrcritic giving it a \"9\" after admitting the 3D is awful and the acting isn't great -- those are two pretty big factors to only dock 1 point for, in my opinion).  The Saw movies stopped being scary a long time ago and now they are just endurance tests for the audience and while Saw VI was one of the stronger entries in the series, Saw 3D is a bland, strictly by-the-numbers affair. Logic and plausibility have never been high on the series checklist, but here they're thrown out the window and any sense of adhering to a realistic timeline is fuzzy at best. Betsy Russell, Cary Elwes and Tobin Bell are all welcome returns but even they can only do so much with what they got. Still, there is that great ending...just don't get duped into thinking it absolves the previous 80 minutes from being anything more than just average at best."

      "text": "Any Saw movie past the 3rd is automatically awful. That seems to be the general consensus now and it's really quite ignominious. Who cares if there are 7 movies in the series? That's not really a superfluous amount when they're all well written. Sure, a lot of the plot twists are similar, but they work! People need to get over the number of movies an look at the story. It's not just gratuitous violence. There's a really interesting plot unlike Hostel. The only reason Saw 3D isn't the best in the series is because the first movie was so disparate than anything we had seen in horror before. Sure, the acting is not the best in these movies, but for me, Saw 3D negated any problems I had with the characters.Jigsaw is teaching people to appreciate life through traumatizing yet allegorical means. That's the goal anyway. When Amanda is helping him though, she rigs the traps so people can't escape, believing that they don't deserve a chance. Hoffman does what Jigsaw asks, but blackmails Amanda for his own gain, and in Saw 3D, goes on a revenge killing spree after facing his own \"test\" in Saw 6.The Saw series is meant to be a story about people learning to value their lives and become better for what they've experienced, but for the most part, things don't go according to plan because everyone is so  close-minded. The plot becomes much less convoluted after the 5th installment, but again, people don't want to give it a chance because of how many there are. All the movies are under 2 hours in length, so do yourself a favor and see them if you haven't. Saw 6 makes up for Saw 5, and Saw 3D has the perfect ending for the series that I should have seen coming, but didn't, and I think that might be the case for a lot of people. All the loose ends are tied up, and there is no hint of an eighth movie. Saw 3D gives the one, final twist that it needed to make up for any mistakes in the past, and while not all of the traps are as brutal as those in previous movies, they will make your stomach churn, your throat sore like mine, (you'll see)."

In regards to the other films, I'd say this wasn't as good as the original, but probably on a par with 2 and 6.  A satisfying conclusion to an original and tense series."

      "text": "It should've been Jill(Betsy Russell), not Mark(Costas Mandyor), a serial killer with no showmanship, no panache, who should have carried on Jigsaw's work as a good samaritan. (He's getting rid of a**holes, right?) But in \"Saw III\", the batty moralist dies. Maybe \"Saw\" shot its wad too soon, killing off John(Tobin Bell) in the midst of a then-wildly popular franchise, leaving the keys to the kingdom in Mark's hands, leaving \"Saw\" in a lurch. Without having seen all seven(!!!) films, my guess is that Jigsaw was better alive than dead, a proactive character with a puppet who would look more at home with the cast of Peter Jackson's \"Meet the Feebles\" than Jim Henson's Muppets. More than John, Mark needs that puppet; he'd be nothing without that male ventriloquist's dummy. The man is a cipher, when you compare this dirty cop with other iconic villains from other popular horror movie franchises. Must we name names? Well, for starters, Freddy Krueger didn't need no stinkin' traps to be interesting. \"Saw\" made a mistake in that third installment, which probably cost them at the box office in the long run. After the father of a kidnapped daughter runs a skill saw across Jigsaw's throat, the series could have gone in two directions. (Both more interesting than its chosen path.) Since the puppet, not the puppetmaster, is the films' lasting icon, why not consolidate the two and have Jigsaw calling the shots as a reanimated insentient toy(a soul transference closer to the spirit of Richard Attenborough's \"Magic\" than Tom Holland's \"Child's Play\", since the former also featured a ventriloquist's dummy, whereas Chucky was a doll), with Jill, playing the Anthony Hopkins role, in which you're not sure if it's her, or the doll, doing the manipulating. The second scenario would have been an ever greater improvement, especially when applied to \"Saw: 3D\", a film that's all rote murder and no surprises. This scenario doesn't exclude Mark; he could kill some, but just don't leave ALL the killing to him. Make Mark the second copycat. Like the Jonas Ackerland-directed music video for The Prodigy's \"Smack My **** Up\", \"Saw: 3D\" could have used the short form music video's first-person approach to conceal the trap designer's identity, especially her sex. In \"Smack My **** Up\", the aggressive behavior on part of the unseen person suggests we're watching a man. To find out that the agitator is female, is a shock. Having two psychos help account for the moral inconsistencies of the one-man judge and jury, Mark, who in one instance, takes the skinheads trapping(David Lowery of Camper Van Beethoven \"Take the Skinheads Bowling\" instead), then in the same breath, has no qualms about involving a complete innocent like the author's wife, who had no inclination that her husband lied about being a Jigsaw survivor. Like Ellen Page in David Slade's \"Hard Candy\", Mark doesn't care if the skinheads hate minorities, both he and Hayley Stark(she doesn't really care if the pedophile, played by Patrick Wilson, f*cks underaged girls) just get off on torturing people. (Look at the poster for \"Hard Candy\", it's very \"Saw\"-like.) \"Saw: 3D\" just simply thinks too highly of itself. The final installment of this pioneering torture-porn series insists on mythologizing itself by returning Dr. Lawrence Gordon(Cary Elwes) to that warehouse bathroom like it was a paramountcy moment, on par with Luke Skywalker first arriving at Tatooine in George Lucas' \"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\", rather than honoring the most important horror trope of them all: the \"final girl\". As the final girl, Jill is supposed to own the pleasure of killing the killer, but no, torture porn plays by its own rules, having little regard for the old school template of the pre-\"Hostel\" days that served a film like John Carpenter's \"Halloween\", and others, so well, because Mark grabs hold of Jill, seats our heroine, and rips her face open with a bear trap."

      "text": "Saw 3D gave the gore fans exactly what they wanted: Gore.  So much gore, delivered in various ways - some more inventive than others.  Sadly, for those who have followed the story and kept up, gore alone was not going to make this a good film.  I won't repeat the many flaws this film has, as other reviewers here have that base fully covered, but I will elaborate on something most just mention.  Lazy/poor scripting.  Characters weren't just killed; they were assassinated.  Jill, for example, had been a quiet character who used her head and kept her cool.  She knew the part she had to play, and until the end of Saw VI she had played it well.  However, in Saw 3D she appeared to have a complete character reversal.  Gone was the cool and calculating woman who could rely on her quick mind to escape almost anything.  What we got instead was a typical horror movie \"screaming queen\" who did nothing but blunder around without anything resembling a thought process going on in her head.  There was no fight in her as she fled from Hoffman, and she seemed to just resign and accept her fate once she was captured.  This change was repeated for the other main players in this film.  6 films' worth of character development was thrown aside so the characters could do what the script wanted them to do, instead of the script bending to the needs of the characters.  Yes, the previous films were guilty of giving highly dubious reasons as to why people were doing the things they did, but at least some attempt of justification was given as to why this wasn't \"out of character\" behaviour.  Saw 3D made huge changes and offered no explanation as to why.  That's what upset me the most about this film, and why I think it's the weakest of the bunch."

      "text": "spoilers: Im a big fan of saw and loved all 6 of them. But saw 7 was just disappointing. Saw 7 was supposed to be the collision of ALL 6 movies combined. We wanted to know more about the man we have been waiting to see for the past 7 years.(Gordon) The justification for Bobby and his victims were so dumb. If you like watching people die then you will like it. There are plenty of loose ends and you would think that there would be a saw 8 because of the unanswered questions. Why has Gordon assisted Jigsaw? What happened to Easton's killers,sister, and saved victims? Why did they just lazily scrap the 2 victims of saw 5? What happened to Gordon's family? I assume the other 2 pigmaks resemble Gordon's appretinces as he takes on the rightful role as Jiggsaw. Now, the point of Bobby was so that since he could not understand the pain of being a victim, he had no power to save others, but he did. He helped alot of people appreciate life. Who cares if he lied, he may have been in it for fame and fortune but what he got wasnt justified, it was a cheap excuse to put more traps. Bobby's victims were even more innocent. You put in traps because you dont appreciate life or your ruining someone elses. They didnt do either. There wasnt much of Tobin(Jiggsaw), he only had like 1 scene. Saw1-6 were true to the series giving deserving punishments with great twists. But saw 7 wasnt. You would expect the last one to be the best. Why didnt Gordon return for Adam? Throughout the movie, your supposed to be fixated on Hoffman and Bobby, but the fans are obviously on their toes, waiting for Gordon. Many things are unanswered but to be honest, its somewhat implied. But we really want to see why Gordon became the new Jiggsaw. Saw has a knack for giving us a great ending that will make us want to come back to see the sequel so we can find the answers to the questions we have been wondering. Saw 7 does the same except provides no sequels so no answers. People criticize it for saw 7 trying to tie up loose ends instead of tell a story, but they didnt even tie up the loose ends, some of it is still loose. Ok im done, ill be in my angry dome, drinking cups of anger tea."

Additionally, the killing of Jill Tuck was the only thing that was slightly poetic. The fact of the matter is that this movie didn't sum up the series at all. This movie was supposed to be the culmination of all of Jigsaw's work. This did not summarize anything. It did not wrap up the story.

Yet, the producers and directs have chosen gore and violence over cleverness, and it's so disappointing. I saw the movie in 3D and I don't think the 3D effects were used enough, and it's not like theaters are set up to spray you with red water when you see blood splatter so the 3D is really a gimmick.

      "text": "Saw has shown a ferocious unwillingness to evolve. Once the huge grosses started rolling in, plenty of franchises would upgrade to better actors, pricier screenwriters, and production values that didn\u2019t fall somewhere between a Roger Corman cheapie and a snuff film. But the producers behind the Saw films are understandably reluctant to mess with a winning formula. Each entry feels more or less like the last. They\u2019re seemingly filmed on the same grungy, dirty, barely lit set, reusing the same generic-looking C-list actors. And in a particularly stubborn act of willful water-treading, they continue to prominently feature Tobin Bell as the mischievous, moralistic protagonist, even though his character died several sequels ago.\r In Saw 3D, the eighth and ostensibly last series installment, David Cassidy look-alike/Boondock Saint Sean Patrick Flanery plays a bestselling author who\u2019s made a fortune off an inspirational book in which he fictitiously recounts having survived one of Bell\u2019s deadly traps. Saw makes its victims suffer for even the most minor transgressions, so Bell\u2019s flunkies cook up a punishing test for Flanery, to fit the severity of his crime. In order to save his beloved wife, Flanery must make his way through a series of deadly traps involving his friends and handlers. Meanwhile, series veteran Betsy Russell, playing Bell\u2019s traumatized ex, goes to the police and dimes out Bell accomplice/law-enforcement agent Costas Mandylor, who sets about enacting revenge the only way he knows: through a series of gruesome traps.\r Bell\u2019s minions continue to behave like the world\u2019s grisliest life coaches. They even use the touchy-feely language of therapy-speak; traps are designed specifically to teach Flanery important lessons about reexamining his priorities and valuing his loved ones. Successories-style sentiments get joined to low-rent gore, maddeningly redundant setpieces, and an arbitrary police procedural about a hotshot detective intent on taking Mandylor down. With the possible exception of Final Destination, no horror franchise is as devoted to cheap gimmicks, and no gimmick is more ubiquitous these days than 3-D. But Saw 3D does little with the technology; even in 3-D, the film looks flat. This entry is being billed as the series closer, and as a tiny change of pace, but don\u2019t believe the hype. Saw 3D offers the same old overwrought, laughably melodramatic **** only this time in one more dimension."

This is actually self parody.This film starts out with a trap that's shown to the public. Why would Hoffman make this decision? There's 2 dudes and their girlfriend having to fight to see which one dies. There's a way to keep all 3 of them alive, but these guys are idiots. The dialogue is also cringy as hell, and I end up laughing. \"I think we're breaking up with you Dina!\" just makes me laugh so f**king hard, it's so stupid.And if you're wondering how that scene and the characters contribute to the story, they don't!This film should've opened with the garage trap, because the scene has Hoffman blowing up a car to distract the people, so he could take one of the body bags and hide in it to sneak his way to the police station.There's other problems as well. Gibson is an obnoxious character who's always calling Jill crazy. And he's SO IMPORTANT to the plot that he, gets killed 20 minutes before the film is over and is never mentioned at all. Wtf.There's also this stupid dream sequence with Jill being killed, and it's just dumb.Then there's the trap plot. Bobby Dagen's traps has him having to save his co-workers and wife. Out of the 4 people he has to save, all 4 of them die! Why the hell should I care?! You could've kept Cale alive, his death is just getting hanged by a noose. Nina's and Suzanne's deaths were at least bloody and gory, but Cale's is just boring! And Joyce, the wife, is punished more than Bobby is, though she is actually completely innocent!For his final test, Bobby should've been the one who dies if he fails instead of Joyce!Also, the trap plot doesn't contribute much to the story, and it ends so early, that I actually forgot about it.There's other problems like Hoffman murdering a bunch of people at the police station. Not only is this out of character, but he kills so many people, when he only needed to kill Heffner, Palmer, and Rogers!And then there's the plot twist about Dr Gordon being another Jigsaw apprentice. This adds almost nothing to the plot, except for Hoffman being locked up in the bathroom. If it was just Gordon needed to take action if Jill was harmed, then I would've been fine. But nope, he's another Jigsaw, and this is f**king ridiculous.Now this film is called Saw 3D, because it was filmed in 3D. The 3D effects are awful, and because it's in 3D, the blood looks pink. There's also this cheap look to this film, and it sucks.I've been ranting for so long, so let's name some positives. The gory kills are great, like the skinheads deaths in the garage trap, Nina's throat impalements, and Suzzane's eyes and mouth impalements. The Reverse Bear Trap on Jill finally shows someone getting their jaw ripped open, and it's fantastic. The traps are great for the most part, although Bobby's final trap is revealed to be a bunch of bullsh*t, the scene with previous Jigsaw survivors is an interesting idea, and the story is written well for the most part.But the final product just turned out to be a crappy disappointment. 3.5/10"

I watched it twice, but when I did, it gave me pretty much a headache. I just don't know why. so, whats my opinion of it? well, true. the filming was messy, the writing was kind of sloppy and the acting was poorly, but this movie is enjoyable, yet not memorable, the 3D effects weren't so bad and they were the only saving grace of why this movie is a good lackluster installment in the series. an eighth installment was planned, but due to the decrease in the box office performance for Saw VI compared to previous installments led to Saw 3D being the final planned film in the series, and the plot concept for Saw VIII being incorporated into Saw 3D. Saw 3D is an irritating, but a good way to end the series and thank god it is finally over. Grade: D+"

Gotta say that final scene when one of the main guys is completely screwed no matter what they did gave me chills.I'll pay to see it in theaters again, too. In 3D no less.PS: Much better than 6 in my opinion. #5 was the worst I believe."

So, from this part i was expecting something good. But the plot is dull, actors play awful (especially new detective), death-scenes are disgusting. Well, there is only one good moment - the ending (that lasts for about 3 minutes)... Hole movie is a big mess, it shouldn't be made. Thanks god, that i watched it NOT in 3D!"

      "text": "Let me start off by saying I have seen all the Saw Movies, 1-6, and decided to see the final Saw film. I was more than disappointed.I am doing a comparison to what the Saw films were originally like, if you don't like that then don't read my review, simple as that.Saw 1, 2 and 3 (In my opinion) relied mostly on a gripping understanding of morals and a complete regression to violence to resolve problems. However, Saw 4 and 5 just relied on slice and dice gore like most of the horror industry is these days. Saw 6 then came as a surprise to me, it made me seem like they had a shot at making the franchise start up well again. So I went into Saw 7 with high hopes that it would live up to the 6th film and the first three movies. Needless to say, it went back to what Saw 4 and Saw 5 did, mindless gore, lackluster plot. But only this time it had the introduction of something that almost all movies have these days, 3D! (Which was also lackluster).Also the plot twist.... Really? The lack of imagination was both disappointing and boring.My Review: 23/100Consensus: If your new to the series, stay WAY away, rent the first movie and start from there. If your a fan, go ahead and watch it, it won't hurt, it might lower your standards though.If you want more reviews like this, or want to request a review, go to gamerspurgatory.darkbb.com, sign up and message DarkZX"

      "text": "SAW 3D well-manges to prove a series can continue going without hitting rock bottom. I don't care about the acting very well, but perhaps not even the 'Top Critics' get the plot of this film, which makes me sad. In SAW 3D (SPOILER ALERT) When Bobby Dagen shows his scars, and what he has to say... It is actually, interesting. If you listen carefully to some of these kinds of moments in this film, or the WHOLE series... I am pretty sure you will know what I am talking about, but you really do actually have to listen. I can end this review, saying it truly is now SAW VI or III, but it sure is a great way to end the franchise."

I'm not having a go at the saw series, because I think it is well written, and I'm not having a go at how many movies there are, because all of them up to now have been decently written. After Saw III, the films went downhill a bit, but they were never bad. They always had a couple of interesting plot twists that would keep you watching until the end. But this one wasn't good at all. The main trap of the film has nothing to do with the plot, though it is slightly interesting. The plot twist at the end is alright but there's only one, and it's not really the finale ending we were all hoping for after six movies. I am a fan of the Saw movies, but I can't say I like this one. It was a poor ending to the series and I expected better."

Horrible acting performances, borderline pointless story line and deaths that happen so quick and often that you can't even possible connect with any individual character. Worst movie that I have seen this year!!!"
