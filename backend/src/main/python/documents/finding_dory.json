It prioritizes luck over problem-solving which ends up as weak storytelling.  Also the appearance of Marlin and Nemo felt unnecessary as they only minimally contribute to the progression of the story while taking quite a bit of screen time.\r Overall a passable movie but without the depth that I expect from pixar."

The movie presents an interesting premise, revealing the background of Dory, one of Pixar's most beloved characters. Unfortunately, this journey does not take place in the ocean, which really bothers me. Instead, it takes place mainly on a marine life institute. However, something made it all worth it: the new characters. They're just so charismatic that I can't help but love them. All of them. The structure of the plot may not be as great as it was in Finding Nemo, but Finding Dory has enough to keep you entertained through all of it."

      "text": "Since 1995, when \"Toy Story\" was released, Pixar has managed to reinvent the animation genre by becoming the first studio to release full-length computer animated films. They didn't just change the animation technique. They added much depth to animated stories and made these films enjoyable for the entire family. While the studio has been facing a decline in quality as of late, \"Finding Dory\" is an exception of that and manages to meet the early standards of Pixar movies.Taking place just months after \"Finding Nemo\" ended, Dory remembers her long lost family and tries not only to find her parents, but also to remember how exactly she was lost. That leads her and her friends, Marlin and Nemo, to California. There they will have to face many challenges and meet new friends in the Marine Life Institute, as Dory is trying to remember.\"Finding Nemo\" set the bar high, so it was difficult for this sequel to meet expectations, even after coming 13 years later. \"Finding Dory\" could have gone wrong in many ways, such as by focusing on Dory, a character with short-term memory loss and a comic relief, which most audiences can't relate too. But people who don't suffer from disabilities can relate to Marlin and Nemo, as they struggle to help their friend. The movie is heartfelt, complex, funny, cute, deep and teaches a very important lesson. It's also stunning. A great time for all families and for fans of the original and an impressive feat in the history of sequels."

The 27th film to do that so and the 5th animation film. This sequel was made after 13 years, surely a long gab, but 'Finding Nemo' was one of my favourite animations, tell me who does not love it those who love animation. Nevertheless, I liked the idea of having a sequel, but I scared it would go to flop terribly. Now, after watching this, I totally stunned. This is not a greatest animation ever made, but the way the screenplay handled, along with other stuffs, this makes one of the best among its kind.Firstly, when I heard the sequel's title, it made me laugh. Like, whaaaat? Once again the story is going to repeat. I did not think it would bring a big change. Actually, it was a different tale, especially I was not expecting it to be emotional. Tell me how many tearjerker-animation you have seen. Once again the Disney-Pixar jointly did it. I think appreciation must go to the director who also made the original film. Great casting too, I mean the voice- over artists.We know that Dory is severely suffering from the short term remembory (memory) loss. Now this tale is going to reveal her backstory. From her childhood to till she meets Marlin and then Nemo, there was a series of forgotten events. She slowly regains some of those memories and begins her quest to find out more. This is where she gets lost, but the title defines that she was lost before and now looking a way to get back where she really belongs.For me, after 'Frozen', this film is what emotionally got me. The value of having family and friends beautifully disclosed. It might be an animation, but still a meaningful story from many perspectives. Lots of new characters were introduced and those were really cool ones. I expect theirs short animations to make its way about their origins, particularly Hank the octopus and his story about how he lost one of his tentacles.The Oscars is the quarter of a year away, but releasing nominees would come weeks ahead. So it's about time to learn where this one fit in. But I'm anticipating close contest between this, 'Zootopia' and 'Red Turtle'. Coming back to the review, this is a good watch, for everybody, so I highly recommend it. I hope there will be a third film, but like I had felt before this, I desire it and then I'm not sure it would extend its legacy to further. So fingers crossed!9/10"

Loved it.\r Pros: It looks good.\r Cons:\r(1) The film failed to step away from its predecessor and the other Pixar films and do something really different. Considering the numerous in-built messages of the preceding Pixar films, this film does not seem to have a profound message of its own. Was there a need to make a sequel to Finding Nemo? Could it have been written better?\r (2) Many of the stunts in the film did not seem plausible. They seemed to be set-up to convince the younger audiences only.\r Who would think the film is great? All childen.\rWho would think the film is only so-so? All adults\rWho would think the film is lousy? No one.\r Rating: 4/5 (no half scores). It's worth it to watch it in the cinemas."

I didn't think it would hit the feels like Nemo did, especially when the plot is very similar, but it did and I would say it hit deeper than the 1st film did. Dory's sense of hopelessness at times with their memory loss did make me tear up. In the 1st film her memory loss made Dory like the comic relief of the film, here we actually get to see all the trouble and emotions of living with it. The animation of the film is top tier aswell. Thomas Newman's score hits a perfect 10 also. For those who were huge fans of Finding Nemo as a kid, this is a certain must-watch.

When you try to make a sidekick the star, their casual presence doesn't always work as the focus. Dory, who has only short term memory, decides to go in search of her parents. This takes her on adventures all over an aquatic theme park, but the sequel is darker, literally and thematically. Where the first featured colorful, delightful animation, this one often takes place in murky, gloomy environments. Dory's search leads to continuous self-doubt and hesitation. The movie runs too long, partially because the story takes too many twists and turns (ebbs and flows?). DeGeneres' flippant way with a punch line still lands the laffs and there are the requisite new wacky characters. Although less delightful than the original, it still has moments of entertaining fun.

Of the many films I have seen this year so far I would rate \u201cFinding Dory\u201d in the top 5.\r Yes Ellen DeGeneres is back as Dory and Albert Brooks is Nemo\u2019s father, while Nemo is now voiced by Hayden Rolance along with Diane Keaton and Eugene Levy as Dory\u2019s parents, Ty Burrell as Bailey the  Beluga whale, Kaitlin Olson as Destiny the near sighted shark among many others but don\u2019t waste time trying to figure out who is what creature as it will only drive you crazy!\r I do expect a feature like \u201cFinding Destiny and Bailey\u201d in 2-3 years!!\r By the way we adults outnumbered the kids at the matinee which might say something---or not!"

      "text": "So why this isn't necessarily the BEST Pixar film, I gotta give it credit for opening kids up to such a serious topic such as mental health.\r Dory has short term memory loss.\r What was once a funny little gimmick for Finding Nemo is explored and opened up and is shown as something a lot more devastating and serious. Dory's memory loss is absolutely devastating. It stops her from achieving tasks and stops her from living a normal life. The way the film portrays how awful and how mental illness really effects everybody and how it destroys and tears people apart, yet also brings them together.\r This films was absolutely beautiful. I loved every moment. Its so cute and adorable but has soooo much heart and soul. I honestly started crying at one scene in the film. Being someone that actually struggles with mental illness it just brought a tear to my eye seeing a light film explore such a topic in such a positive and light hearted way that doesn't hide how frustrating and awful such a thing is.\r absolutely loved it."

      "text": "Another review said it best and I will confirm those comments. This movie is decent and kids will enjoy it, but it is a recycle of the original and has the feel and story-quality of a sequel better released directly to DVD.  Finding Dory is full of color and cuteness but overwhelmed with far-fetched scenarios that fell hollow and contrived to me.  I was not terribly impressed and remember thinking after seeing Finding Nemo that it was a movie better left without a sequel.  Disney might have done better with a sequel with a little more of a statement about the condition of our oceans and a thicker plot."

      "text": "Finding Dory was a huge disappointment. I went to see it today not expecting much, but hoping for just a little Pixar magic. Unfortunately what I got was a big cliched cash in, full of obvious humor, obnoxiously over the top cutesy characters and a slapdash plot. I found all the characters to be mildly irritating and they had none of the charm they possessed in Finding Nemo.\rIt was such a half arsed, predictable story! It lacks every ounce of depth Nemo had. I know it's a kid's film (and I'm sure your kid is gonna like it) but that's what I used to love about Pixar! It was for everyone even us twenty somethings!\rIt's such an obvious money grab and it makes me really sad that Pixar is sinking to that. I've got a bad feeling about The Incredibles 2 and Toy Story 4.\rThere is one saving grace however!!! The short at the start was absolutely fantastic! It's by far the best Pixar short I would say and worth the price of my movie ticket even if the film itself isn't."

      "text": "As sequels go, Finding Dory is an unqualified Pixar success.  Colorful, funny, and moving with outstanding animation and 3D, there are no boring moments.  It's a little more \"frantic\" than the original Nemo, and since the storyline is similar some of the freshness of the original is gone.  In the original Nemo had to find a way out of one aquarium.  In this one, fish are constantly hopping from container to container to container even moving from building to building making the story seem less believable.  The rescue scene of the Van on the freeway is way over the top and felt like a Looney Tunes cartoon rather than Pixar.  The animated short \"Piper\" they show at the beginning, however, is outstanding and probably my favorite short they have done so far.  Incredible animation, maybe the best I've ever seen."

      "text": "Finding Dory is set 1 year after the events of Finding Nemo, and our familiar fish faces Nemo (Hayden Rolence), father Marlin (Albert Brooks), and Dory (Ellen DeGeneres)- the blue tang with short-term memory loss- have settled into normal life at the reef. Dory's memory is infuriating everyone, including herself- and she's struggling to find a role in sea life. But one day, she regains some memories of her family and is determined to find them. But she knows she can't do it alone. Accompanied by Nemo and-reluctantly- Marlin, she must once again make her way across the ocean navigated only by sporadic memories of her childhood to find her parents. But it won't be easy. Along the way she encounters old friends, new creatures, and no shortage of obstacles between her and being reunited with her family. But is this journey futile, or just too impossible?\r 13 years. 13 years we have been waiting for this movie. And may I just applaud Pixar on such a smart way of making money. Now you've got all the people who were kids when they saw Nemo, all the parents who saw it with them, all the current kids who can see this one, and all the current parents, plus all the others who are just interested in the movie. That's a lot more of an audience than you would normally get for the average children's film. Pixar have released amazing films that are fantastic in giving you the feels and providing quality animated movies. They have received an impressive 30 nominations and 11 wins at the Academy Awards, but they haven't faired so well in two out of three sequels they've made. This combination of reputations gave me both excitement and weariness going into this movie. The trailers didn't look so good as well. The verdict?...SUCCESS!! Thank God! Pixar is back on track!\r This film was the definition of 'a rollercoaster of emotions'. Fear, sadness, desperation, admiration, happiness, laughter, ecstasy, hysteria, and tears (of both happiness and sadness) could be seen by the people sitting next to me in the theatre. That is what I believe composes a quality film. The plot was well-designed and crafted- even if in their journey they go around in circles a little bit- and wastes no time getting underway in the beginning. There is a bit of back and forth between flashbacks and reality, which got annoying after a while, and those emotions I was talking about before were not sustained consistently throughout the movie. They existed in small pockets, especially so nearer to the climax(es) of this movie. This could easily be a source of boredom. And then there's Dory herself. You either love her or hate her. When the movie started, Dory was doing her whole 'sorry, I forgot' routine every 5 seconds and I groaned thinking; 'is this really going to be the whole movie?' but luckily it's not, but it's definitely there. Just enough so that you accept that its a character trait, not an annoyance. And one last thing about plot conveniences, HOW DOES NOBODY SEE THIS OCTOPUS CLEARLY MOVING INFRONT OF YOU??? (more of him in a second...)\r The cast has a lot of familiar faces- especially if you've seen Modern Family- including old faces Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks, Hayden Rolence, Andrew Stanton and Bob Peterson among others meeting new faces Ed O'Neil, Ty Burrell, Diane Keaton, Eugene Levy, Sloane Murray, Idris Elba, and Dominic West. All the voicing was excellent, with DeGeneres demonstrating more of an emotional range. We got to see some solid character development from all our characters, but I would've liked to see some more depth from Hank the octopus- who was one of my favourite new additions- as cruel as he is stealthy- able to hide in plain sight and pull off some daring escapes without being seen due to his dexterity and ability to camouflage, however, I loved all the new additions!!\r Themes include family, belonging, uniqueness, friendship, and loyalty. As usual, there's plenty of morals here for the kids to live by. The animation was up to its great standard, and the cinematography was fantastic, along with Stanton and McLane's directing. In terms of engagement, my attention was lost sometimes, but most of the time, I was thoroughly engaged by the storyline, characters, blending of genres and spectacular animation. The ending, however, I felt was a little too long. Poignant, but tedious. No cliches here either, another unique Pixar film. The tone was simultaneously emotional yet lighthearted due to the way the proceedings occur. I expect some Oscar nominations from this movie.\r You should probably watch Finding Nemo to get some context of the characters, but it isn't a necessity. They make some references to the original which is good for nostalgic purposes. To improve, sustain the emotive scenes and engaging qualities over the entire film for better engagement, and the running time probably could've been cut down."

      "text": "\"Finding Dory\" had a lot to live up to, as \"Finding Nemo\" is considered by many to be one of the best Pixar films. \"Nemo\" had it all. Amazing story, characters, lessons, and visuals. While Dory doesn\u2019t hit all the marks as well, it\u2019s solid entertainment.\r The Breakdown:\r Story: 3/5\rStrengths:\rThe set pieces and obstacles are the protagonist instead of having an actual villain.\rGreat humor throughout.\rSome creative ties into the first film.\r Weaknesses:\rThe illusion of realism is broken in the third act with far fetched antics that are tough to swallow even with talking fish.\rLacks some of the strong lessons and heart that Find Nemo had. (Though Piper, the animated short before the film, makes up for this.)\r Characters: 4.5/5\r Strengths:\rHank the Octopus played by Ed O\u2019Neill steals every scene he\u2019s in.\rPixar does it again by working in the animals habits and mannerisms into every character in the film.\rYou look forward to every character to show back up as the story progresses.\r Weaknesses:\rA funny gag from the original  with Dory \u201cspeaking whale\u201d is over used and looses its humor and charm.\r Visuals: 5/5\r Strengths:\rPixar animation continues to advance, and every shot in the entire film is beautifully done.\rThe animated short Piper before the film has some of the most realistic textures and environmental elements I\u2019ve ever seen in computer graphics.\r Weaknesses:\rNone\r Bottom Line: 4/5\r The story is very straightforward and is missing the depth of the first film. However the fantastic cast of characters and how well they tie to their real world animal counterparts is extremely well done. Pixar\u2019s beautiful animation continues to impress and really brings the characters and environments to life. It\u2019s a solid entertainment for kids and adults, and highly recommend a theatrical viewing.\r Stay in your seats as there is a fantastic post credit scene!"
