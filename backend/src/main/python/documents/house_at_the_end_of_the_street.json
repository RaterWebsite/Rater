Her stunning and unique look combined with her incredible range as an actress means she provides a solid lead, regardless of the plot. Speaking of which, this one actually had a halfway decent premise with some real potential. I think the movie ultimately fell apart for the lazy writing that led to a poor execution of the plot and the mediocre supporting cast. Elisabeth Shue leads a lot to be desired as the worrisome mother and Max Thieriot just doesn't deliver. A major part of the lazy writing I referenced earlier is the cliched \"person gets themselves into trouble by being stupid\" element that plagues so many of these movies. Lawrence's character might be among the nosiest I've ever seen in a movie. I leave it at that but I will say, it's tough for a movie to be suspenseful when you spend more time aggravated at the characters than you do worried for their safety."

      "text": "House at The End of The Street is another ambitious, low budget, Horror film, that tries to make a name for itself by using star power, but how much was I really expecting from a PG-13 Horror film? The story begins when Elissa and her mother move to a new house in the country, a house that is across the street from the scene of a grizzly double murder four years earlier. The house and story is surrounded by rumors and still occupied by the son of the victims, who Elissa quickly befriends. Once again we have a common theme that has been done to death, but the producers of this film were hoping that by spending big bucks on Jennifer Lawrence (Hunger Games) and Max Thieriot (Bates Motel) that they could get people to watch their film and it worked, but I suspect most people were sadly disappointing like I was. The acting was terrific and everything you would expect from these actors, but the story was so simple and predictable that it really wasn't worth watching. Being a PG-13 film didn't help either as there wasn't really anything too horrific or creepy to really catch your attention. If that wasn't bad enough, the first hour of the film was so slow, that I almost turned it off. The only thing that kind of gave me a laugh was that there was a lot of scenes with Jennifer Lawrence in the woods and I couldn't help but think that Katniss wished she had her bow. House at The End of The Street is a film that has the star power, but not much else, as it's a slow, tame, predictable film, that's been done and it leaves far too many unanswered questions. If you're a die hard Jennifer Lawrence fan, check it out, otherwise, I wouldn't waste my time on this one."

It's not scary or interesting and it's not original. This is a movie for people who have never watched a horror movie in their entire life. I wonder how many people who gave this movie a good review are horror movie fans. Somehow I doubt it. That's not to say that you're an idiot for liking it, but there are other movies that have done this kind of story before and they've done it better.\r As for the \"twist ending,\" the opening scene kind of gave it away. I'm not a horror movie junkie, but even I kind of knew something was up. Also, if you think that twist is \"omg so original,\" there's a 1980s slasher movie called Sleepaway Camp. Exact same twist done much better.\r And if you still want to see this because Jennifer Lawrence is in it, I think you should come up with a better reason than that. There are other better Jennifer Lawrence movies to see like Winter's Bone, Silver Lining Playbook (haven't seen it but I hear it's good), and, oh yeah, The Hunger Games. If you like Jennifer Lawrence, watch those movies."

Mark Tonderai's new thriller loses itself in tired old cliches that have long since lost their appeal. The film is terribly miscast, forcing Elisabeth Shue and Jennifer Lawrence into an awkward mother/daughter relationship that feels very unnatural on screen. Max Thieriot's mousy performance is rather unconvincing as well, and lacks the impact needed in order to leave a lasting impression. The supposed twists offer few surprises, especially for audiences that have already seen the same story played out in a hundred different ways. This drains the film of any suspense, while the lapses in logic and poor decision making by the characters are sure to infuriate viewers. It would be better to just lock HOUSE AT THE END OF THE STREET away in the cellar with the countless other PSYCHO-spawns than to have anyone else suffer through another uninspired copy."

It starts off generally promising, even if a bit generic, giving us time to get to know our main characters. Lawrence's character seemed to be level-headed and able to look out for herself. This character trait seems to diminish in the second half of the film, with her character instead being written as a typical horror chick, making pratfalls and idiotic decisions. The movie overall has a rushed feel to it, which can't be saved by it's adequate cast or relatively good set-pieces. It all just feels like it's trying to distract the audience from the awful writing. In places it feels like this movie is an experiment rather than a box office entry, which makes it even more obvious this film was made by a (relative) newcomer. In conclusion, I don't think the cast had the opportunity to put all of their effort into the roles due to the poorly written script, and although the visuals are good, the plot overall is extremely run-of-the-mill and unoriginal. It had the potential to be good, a piteous disappointment."

When I started watching it it was, admittedly, somewhat slow-going. Jennifer Lawrence, notorious for the \"Hunger Games\", seemed initially out of place in what was starting to look like a dull teen horror flick. But the movie had an amazing twist (and I'm someone who absolutely adores films that toy with your mind). Many people have noted this film as \"predictable\" and said that they \"saw it coming\". I disagree. The twist was definitely unexpected, and  I spent the entire final twenty minutes or so in astonishment.\rThe film only suffers in the story. It was good, don't get me wrong, but lacked something ... I'm not sure what. If you're a fan of Robert De Niro masterpiece \"Hide and Seek\", you'll love this. Just give it time."

I'm not going to say much more than that, but if you haven't seen any previews or know anything about the story in this film; do yourself a favour and watch this immediately. The characters have depth, the acting is on point and the writers and producers of this movie deserve a huge pat on the back."

The movie into a neighborhood that have one macabre event, a girl killed her parents with a hammer and have never being seen again until that very momment, a boy that, as they said, wich is the brother of the girl, he lived away in another city with his aunt, go back to that city and start living in the same house as the parents got killed, wich make a lot of people in the town despise and avoid him. Directed by Mark Tonderai. Written by David Loucka and Jonathan Mostow.The biggest problem with the story of this movie and the movie overall, is that it seems that it doesn't always know what it wants to be, it feels like the movie was meant to be an horror in his cern, but some times it just become a romance scholar movie, it does let you forget what you were watching before, sometimes it is a family relation thing, it simply keeps changing the style of the movie, for me this was a big flaw, it isn't a problem when the movie try to apply different subjects to have more themes approached, the problem is when it change completely the ambience and style of the movie to the point that it seems that it is another movie. Removing this points, the story is actually pretty interesting, i got engaged in what was happening and even curious about somethings that we had going on in that little town, it does have some plot twists, some you can see it coming, some you don't, it does offered you a bunch of points of view of the same story, and only by the end you got to know the true one, with a twist that i really didn't saw it coming. The movie have some events that felt so unrealistic in a way that bothered me for real, like, if there is someone that have been through a trauma, i don't see why almost everybody of a town would despise this person in such a extreme way, for me it was just ridiculous and completely out of the old and good verisimilitude. It also had some other situations that didn't felt right, like someone reaching a place running almost at the same time of someone in a car. When the movie jumps into a true horror, together with the revelations and stuff, it does got considerable better, i can't say that it didn't knew how to create an ambience of horror, it did and worked for me, i could get tense in some moments and it was pretty good, nothing original or innovative, but definely good. In some moments the charactres make a few choices that i considered really dumb or a bit to much, that also got me a little off the movie. The movie contains a bunch of jumpscares, and i gotta say that the first one may works, but all after that one, don't really. Some times the movie got to repetitive, and could be boring.In this movie we have Jennifer Lawrence, she did a good job, could pass some emotions pretty well mainly when it was about romatic moments, i could believe that she liked the boy, in surprise and horror moments i think she was just ok, she could have work a little better in her expressions. Max Thieriot was good, i think he had a a good performance here, he first convinced me a bit of something and then again of the other thing, wich i can't talk much about it because it is a full spoiler, i think it was good to make he didn't change much in voice or behavior, because that is pretty much how that is. Elisabeth Shue was good, she could make me believe that she was really concnerned in every moments, even that her characters pissed me off some times, she did a good job.The camera moviment in horror movies normally it is very important, it makes you not knowing what is happening around the place, or even makes you know something that not even the character does, and it helps in give you axiety during the scene, in this movie it does contain this aspect, but just a little bit, the cameras work here, they aren't excpetional, but definely functional. The cinematography overall, for me worked, even that the movie didn't explored it very much, the thing that having  a forest that you can't see much beyond it, it is already a bit scared, having a camera in there watching the character also worked, sometimes it uses some positioning that for me were very sucessfull into the goal. There is one specific moment in a party, that the camera do a very strange and no sense thing, that comes back to that thing that i said about the movie not knowing what it wants to be."

The audience usually inculcate which is what happened where they believe the person is innocent, either that be Jennifer\u2019s spoilt character or Max, then their left dissatisfied. That\u2019s not really a twist, like I mentioned it was obvious which only reduces the ratings. There are moments of things being sturdy enough and watchable but they failed to deliver. In terms of the performances, it\u2019s the same as every film, a bunch of hormonally driven spoilt teens. The constant licking lips and gulping air pouting for the leads didn\u2019t wash with me as all they were doing was drawing attention to themselves ready for a kiss. Think about what I just said and rewatch it I mean it\u2019s very poor acting and a poor performance from the cast. Flat, generic and not at all going to score highly it failed miserably as the makers concentrated too much on the wrong stuff which detached its audience. A laughable moment the woman locked away actually wakes up with her hair and make up done. I mean come on. Jennifer is too busy trying to achieve maximum attention on screen with strange make up she demonstrates her bad habits on the camera. All in all a very poor movie."
