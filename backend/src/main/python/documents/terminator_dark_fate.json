No spoilers here as we all know the plot (its in the trailers), robot comes from future to kill hero before they can save the world, send good guy back to stop the bad robot... THINK OF SOMETHING ORIGINAL FFS!!! T1 was the best because it was original, T2 was great because it flipped the script, T3, T5 and T6 are cash grabs that can't think of anything new! T4 tried to do something a little new but still relied too much on star power and not enough on good characters. Character development is what's wrong with Hollywood today, they don't know how to write good characters and fall into tired old tropes."

It's John Connor's story, instead he's used here as an insignificant add on to pass his story onto a new female version who was terribly cast. Similarly Arnold, he's only here to help sell tickets and the Terminator character is a mockery of the first two films.There is nothing original here or anything you have to see: it's a blend of the first movies remade, but much worse."

      "text": "Basically throws the narrative of every other Terminator movie out of the window and replaces it by dull, forgettable characters and a future world we get two glimpes of and no-one cares about. By both my friend and I had literally forgotten the name of the protagonist, she's that boring and unworthy.Plot makes no sense and gets repetitive very fast. Basically the entire movie is one long chase that repeats itself. Terminator and protagonists get in a fight, a spectacular explosion knocks everyone out and allow the protagonists to get some distance, Terminator reforms, protagonists go from unconscious to fully operational in 5 seconds, Terminator starts chasing again.The new Terminator model has some new capability and can operate in two different modes, but it is not really shown what the difference/advantages of the two different modes are and the whole thing just seems completely invulnerable anyway. In the end, the way it is defeated makes the whole movie seem utterly pointless."

      "text": "Terminator: Dark Fate is a disappointing Terminator movie, especially since this is the real T3, the sequel to T2: Judgment Day.This film is what The Force Awakens is for the Star Wars franchise: a lazy derivative movie based on the first beloved films. Dark Fate is almost copying T2 to the letter. Highway chase with a truck, liquid metal Terminator, etc. Nothing new in this movie that we haven't seen already in previous Terminator films. This movie is creatively worse than any other Terminator movie. Even Salvation and Genisys had something new to show.But what's even worse, this movie is a SJW parody. Full of political correctness, pseudo-diversity, and feminist propaganda. It's like taking Tomb Raider or Charlie's Angels, writing the women out and replacing them with men. Ridiculous.First they write John Connor's character out and replace him with a female leader that can't inspire nothing. Then Arnie's T-800 is sidelined for the vast majority of the movie (can't believe the stupid backstory they gave to this T-800) in favor of a 6 feet high lady trying to convince the audience she's a badass, and her enhanced abilities are explained by cybernetic augmentations. Yeah, a Resistance hiding underground have the infrastructure to perform cyberpunk surgeries while being rampaged by robots sent by a Skynet that's not named Skynet but acts as Skynet. Yeah, Skynet's also out, but only in name. Now it's called Legion LMAOThe only really good thing in this movie is Linda Hamilton, who really came back as T2's Sarah Connor. Yeah, she's back. Unfortunately Arnie's T-800 doesn't speak this line for the first time ever and it made me cringe."

This franchise should have ended with T2 followed perhaps by a kind of prequel/sequel leading to T1. But the worst thing in this is Cameron's hypocrisy. Do you remember him bragging around about how Fincher killed his beloved characters in Alien 3. Well be ready for the same in the Dark Fate and now it's done and approved by king of the world himself."

      "text": "Steaming pile of **** It gets a three from me solely for some pretty awesome action sequences. Writing is a dumpster fire; characters are shallow; plot holes galore. Essentially, this movie didn't need to be made. It feels like a pretentious, virtue signaling vanity project for Cameron. Creepy agre-regressed Edward Furlong's John Connor is murdered 2 minutes into the film, by a Terminator we never knew about, years after melting all of the cyberdyne evidence. So Judgment Day didn't happen and Skynet never came to be, but a T-800 shows up and Murders John. Ok. All of this makes no difference, however, as humanity has a new hope; a young Mexican girl named Dani. Why is she the hope? Who knows? She is because James Cameron has told you she is. Why does humanity need a savior if Skynet is never created? Because Skynet is created, but it's called Legion and creates terminators that look exactly like the old terminators, in a future that looks exactly like the other future. So essentially, everything that normally happens in a Terminator movie happens here, but the people and names have changed for reasons that are not entirely explained or explanable, for what appears to be political correctness. We're in exactly the same position as before, for unexplainable reasons, solely so Girl-John Connor can be introduced for no reason whatsoever; because it's the same movie regardless.So you see, this movie didn't need to happen. It is a bad version of T2, with a random female lead that exists solely so the movie can reset with a female lead."

      "text": "Lazy script + SJW Politics + Jump the shark scenes = terrible film.  Dark fate is a terrible story....really, there is no story.   It is poorly written and I am shocked James Cameron, who is known for his intricate interwoven story lines and realistic believable characters and action really bombed this movie when he allowed amateur writers to wreck his franchise.  This movie is episodic.  By that I mean it is just the same characters going from one scene to the next in miniature episodes without any over-arcing or interwoven story whatsoever beyond \"lets run to the next location\".    When each episode is done (lasting about 15 minutes), everything that happened in that episode is 100% forgotten and nothing is ever referenced again later on.   Many things in this movie are absurd and grounded in stupidity and poor script writing:.... US Air force major is just going to hand over top secret gear without so much as explaining it to us?  A truck falls 200 feet from a dam into ravenous waters with human passengers and no one is injured?   A plane at 20,000 feet bursts and no one blacks out over decompression?  SJW politics are amock, running foul in this film.  The first 30 minutes are in Spanish, I do not exaggerate, I thought I was watching a foreign film.   One 15 minute episode has our characters at a border detention facility where...surprise surprise...US customs are negatively portrayed complete with a reference to separating families.   Good grief.  Lack of originality:  In this terminator the BIG REVEAL (why she is so important) is so obvious- it was pretty much shouted at us multiple times long before it happened.  NO one with an IQ over 20 would have assumed she was going to give birth to someone after the repeated insults to our intelligence by announcing it loud and clear early on.  John Connor was someone who led the resistance....Guess what this girl does?  Oh yea....how original.  The girl in this movie literally goes from \"i've never touched a gun before\" shy and typical to expert marksman and full on military leader in 5 minutes.   So stupid.A scene where non cyborg humans are underwater and then pop up to the surface like they are made out of Styrofoam is ridiculously unrealistic.too many plot holes and lack of an interwoven story in between all the little \"episodes\" the characters take every 10 minutes...  make iDark Fate a bad movie patronizing to intelligenceBad writing."

The new her-minator was the only good part of this movie. The new \"Joan\" Conner had the charisma of a wet rag and was so badly cast and un-believable in that role it was laughable. Arnold had his balls snipped and was a side show in his own movie. He was playing second fiddle to a 5ft hobbit and a boozed-up, bitter Sarah Conner - who was a shell of the iconic character from T1 and T2. The \"bad\" peewee1000 terminator was bland and about as threatening as an earth worm. The story is just a pathetic and far weaker version of T2 even with many of the same seen-it-all-before action scenes. And what they did to John Connor was disgraceful. They took a huge dump on T2 and ruined it's legacy in the name of nothing more than making way for \"new\" characters.  I need to watch T2 again just to get this crap stain of a movie out my mind!

      "text": "For itself a good movie despite some flaws. What destroys the movie is that it is a hard reboot of the franchise. Yes you read it correctly. All previous movies are meaningless in less than 5 minutes even the good first 2 (Rest is spoiler free). Many people have quit watching the movie here and will give a 0/10 and I will not deny that they have a valid point. It was a mayor complaint by some critiques and most fans. Often it is credited as \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d of the Terminator franchise. I would give a 8/10 without it. In hindsight we could have predicted it as there was a certain character missing in the trailers and no one in the shown cast could fill the role. Increasingly there were rumors that it will ignore the divisive former movies and continue the story from Terminator 2 which is technically accurate. It was an insane decision to pull this off and the box office and fan reactions prove it. I must again say that it is a good movie with characters that I enjoy but it is hard to get as much invested as to the other characters we cared for decades. As remark: People always like long established characters more than new once especially when the new characters could not shine before such drastic events. After the reboot inducing events the story starts after a time gap in Mexico City 2020. A new Terminator is send back in time to kill Dani Ramos and a female soldier is send back to stop him. It is the standard formula for the franchise and the story develops as before with a few twists. Again I say I like the story but it has a few logical flaws that I cant go into details because of spoilers. Lets say the first 2 movies of the franchise made clear what would happen as follow up of a certain event that happened here at the beginning (And it did not happen). It lacks the consequences and with that weakens the menace. For the actors I have only praise and I blame the flaws on the script. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns in his signature role and gets some new facets. I really like the development but be warned it confused some fans and became a WTF moment for them. Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor and delivers the best performance in the movie. Mackenzie Davis as Grace comes close to the best performance. Sadly the script weakens her performance but like I said I wont hold it against her. Natalia Reyes as Dani is good and delivers her role. Gabriel Luna as Gabriel / Rev 9 is excellent. Menacing and ruthless as he / his role has to be. A great cast and it is sad that they wont get the credit they deserve as the reboot overshadows everything by far. The visuals and special effects are as always remarkable. It is a thing each movie in the franchise does right. The action sequences are great too and I like how they use Graces special condition to get more out of it;-). Overall this enters the realm of good movies were a single (really stupid) plot choice ruined the experience. After the reboot inducing element you cant enjoy it as fan as you just feel the loss and potentially anger. It is a shame but cant be changed. I don't know how this could be accepted as the backlash would be unavoidable and clearly foreseeable. I think they need an idea checker that stops such wasteful mistakes."
