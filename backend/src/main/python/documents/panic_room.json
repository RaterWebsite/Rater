The cast here is excellent (Foster, Stewart, Leto and Whitaker) and Fincher's direction is exceptional as always."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Panic Room is a taught, clever thriller with a strong human core. The main body of the film is extremely enthralling - a battle of wits and endurance plays out between a caring, protective mother (Jodie Foster) and the good-natured \"brains\" behind a trio of home-invading criminals (Forest Whitaker). It's among director David Fincher's most fun and unpretentious films (though he quite unfairly seems to dismiss it in interviews), and his technical ability as a director marries well with an electric script by David Koepp. Foster and Whitaker both impress, giving layered and engaging performances as contrasting characters who in fact have a lot in common in their shared intelligence, determination and resilience. A young Kristen Stewart is also very good, with her now famous moody, deadpan acting style lending itself well to playing an insecure, diabetic pre-teen. Panic Room's finale is admittedly a bit scrappy, and the arrival of one of the characters seems to serve the sole discernible purpose of bringing proceedings to an end, which is a welcome reprieve to an extent, as by this point the film is just beginning to tire. As a whole, Panic Room is well-crafted, entertaining and tense, and it actually leaves a lasting impression on the viewer, no matter what its helmsman Mr Fincher may think of it."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "an amazing film by a great director,but it's not perfect, it has it's flaws but i give 8/10 because of the brilliant performances , and plot is also interesting.."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "One of the finest thrillers of her later career, Jodie Foster is exceptional in Panic Room.

The film proves you don't need a huge set and million dollar effects to make a thriller film entertaining."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Grafting twist after twist onto a classically simple setup, Panic Room plunges a dream home into a storm-drenched nightmare out of the grimiest pulps, dragging an unsuspecting mother (Jodie Foster) and child (Kristen Stewart) along for the ride. The latest from Seven and Fight Club director David Fincher, Panic offers a model of tightly orchestrated suspense, compressing Fincher's technical mastery into a pressure cooker of a film. As its unlikely heroine, Jodie Foster scares up deep reserves of cunning from beneath a surface that's all vulnerability. The newly divorced mother of a diabetic pre-teen (Stewart, making a deep impression in her second screen role), Foster takes over what fussy real-estate broker Ian Buchanan describes all too accurately as \"a very emotional property,\" a three-story Manhattan behemoth of an apartment, most recently home to a sickly millionaire with a contested estate. It comes with all the amenities\u2014six fireplaces, multiple bedrooms, a working elevator, stylish original fixtures\u2014and one new addition, a hermetically sealed \"panic room\" outfitted with survival supplies, video monitors, and everything else needed to protect its wealthy inhabitants against home invasion. After only one night in their new home, Foster and Stewart realize why the room is necessary, when, as they sleep, three men (Forest Whitaker, Dwight Yoakam, and Jared Leto) come looking for the millions reportedly left in the apartment. Moments later, in the first of many shifts in the balance of power, the pair realizes the downside to their home-within-a-home: The treasure is in the panic room, and their guests have no intention of leaving until they have it. From there, a true battle of wits ensues, playing out through a series of gambits and countermeasures that turn the apartment into a war zone. Like past masters of suspense from Hitchcock to Spielberg, Fincher recognizes that a working knowledge of elementary physics improves any thriller. When action erupts, it does so in moments as carefully timed as Howard Shore's ominous score, but every moment carries an unsettling believability. That believability extends to the film's real masterstroke: its ability to invest all the players with such desperation that they seem capable of almost anything. Working from a screenplay by the estimable David Koepp, a top-form cast keeps the stakes higher than even the panic-room jackpot could cover. An old-house thriller retrofitted for the 21st century without any touch of unneeded flash, Panic Room is scary enough to do for downtown living what Jaws did for beaches.\r Fincher eschews quick cuts in favor of long, leisurely ones. He knows what he's doing, and the proof is in the result. The suspense in Panic Room never ebbs, and that makes for a thoroughly entertaining -- if somewhat exhausting -- 108 minutes."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "i told you, i don't hurt people..Panic RoomTicking for almost 2 hours, it seems a bit long and stretched considering its premise (it could have easily been of around 90 minutes), it needed a better editing to satisfy the viewers in the end but other than that it works for the most part of it. David Fincher doesn't compromise on the execution but seems a little irresponsible on the editing part and as far as David Koepp's screenplay is concerned; its perspective is interesting enough to invest in it, but lacks on proving a point. Jodie Foster is good in her part and is supported well by great cast like Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto and Kristen Stewart. Panic Room is a fine popcorn entertainer that roots for the big bucks but fails to go deep and take risks which then leads into a shallow soulless feature that looks good in a first glimpse but nothing beyond that."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\u00a1\u25cf\".\".\".\".\".\".\".\".\".\".\".\".\".\".\".\".\".\".\".\".\".\".\".\".\".\".\".\"."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Panic Room is a near-perfect suspense thriller by Fincher.

With that in mind, the runtime could be less and the scenes - time dense, saturated with speed and even more tension. Also I would say that 'Panic Room' was a bit poor as regards to music and sounds. Meg Altman in the role of divorced mother, smart woman, who is not very happy, but is also protective of her child, acted outstanding and justify expectations for such a role. I could say 'Panic Room' is a little bit over rated, but definitely deserves a watch."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This one is pretty good. Overall, it does a good job of making you feel anxious as David Fincher does a great job creating suspense in this one. At every turn, there is yet another thing that makes that suspense build and build. Jodie Foster does a typically great job in the lead and I also found myself enjoying the performance of the three robbers; Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto, and Dwight Yoakam. Each one really represented a different type of robber, with one filling the \"lawful evil\", \"neutral evil\", and \"chaotic evil\", respectively. It was interesting to see this kind of shared focus in this film between Foster and her daughter and then the three robbers as they try to figure their way out of the situation they find themselves in. Overall, this one is not too complex, but that is not problematic, as it is quite enjoyable.\r My main complaint is concerned with the robbers. While I enjoyed watching them all fill the different roles of \"evil\", the film would have been better served if either A) we never saw the robbers' faces/heard them speak or B) they were all \"chaotic evil\". The added suspense from both of those options would have really elevated this one. Though, I am not complaining too much, because, as I said, I did enjoy the role to robbers played."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Boasting some stellar imagery from one of Hollywood's most recognizable modern directors, and an almost unbearable undercurrent of dreadful tension throughout, \"Panic Room\" easily makes for one of the most potent home invasion thrillers I've ever seen."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "In slasher flicks like Scream (1996), break-ins are single scenes. Heist flicks like The Bank Job (2008) or The Score (2001) spend most of the films planning out the break-ins, and then only a scene or two actually carrying them out. So the fact that aside from the very beginning, Panic Room is just really one long break-in scene always made the film seem like a silly waste of time. I mean, it gives the whole plot away right in the title. A couple of thieves arrive and tear up the place, the family hides, problems occur. Hurray.\r The coincidence of everything just-so-happening to be available at the exact right time: the happenstance of the break-in coinciding with the idea that the house just so happens to contain a panic room, this seems too much to handle.\r Yet all the mighty forces align and provide the viewer with an experience that is actually quite satisfying. Although not an overly complicated plot, the script is very well written and includes explanations for exactly why these happenings occur as they do.\r For skeptic viewers like me, who usually find unexplainable exceptional coincidences a deal breakers, David Keopp\u2019s logical, explanatory script (Jurassic Park, Mission Impossible) provides answers, and an excellent foundation for David Fincher to build his dark mess. (IMDB says Keopp got 4 million bucks for the script, so\u2026.).\r Seemingly, this film takes the primal fear of invasion, bad people coming into our homes in the night and doing bad things to us. But rather than exploit the concept a has been beaten to death, Panic Room does not rely on the traditional fear of invasion. It adds dimension, reason, even a kind of logic explaining how this whole event could have turned out right for everyone, if only it could have unfolded just a single day earlier.\r It is in considering the film\u2019s simplicity that the profound difficulty of this film\u2019s production is most realized. The decision for the director and crew to call \u201cthat\u2019s a wrap\u201d must have been murky one.\r Unlike any of Fincher\u2019s other films, Panic Room is shot entirely on only one set, in linear time, and deals with only with a single event. It is minimal in its approach, like a play. It is essentially all based on the interaction of the actors stage together, almost.\r Forest Whitacker, Jodie Foster and even Dwight Yoakam all crank out great performances, but Fincher\u2019s dark, perfectly influential shots, using unusual angles, intercoms and video cameras, small vs. open spaces, and of course, darkness and rain are what make this cinema, and not theater. Aligning open frames with great musical peaks, the score by Howard Shore (Lord of the Rings) intensifies the single track plot of Panic Room, pushing it along as a series of arcs, suspensefully running up and down, each arc increasing in intensity, until the film hits the peak, and even though we knew all along what was coming, we are still very satisfied with when it finally does."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Not a perfect movie, but brings enough trilling to entertain and a story good enough to holds."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Panic Room will make you jump with intensity.\rA very simplistic but extremely well crafted plot with heart pounding suspense that steals the show, Jodie Foster once again finds success."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Director David Fincher elevates the suspense while the script by David Koepp (Mission: Impossible, Spider Man and Jurassic Park) keeps us interested into the characters and their survival and they manage to make an above average thriller, anyway their not the stars the person who really shines in the film is Jodi Foster.
