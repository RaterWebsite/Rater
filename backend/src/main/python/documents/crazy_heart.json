Of all the generic movies of violence and bad storytelling it's very refreshing to see a movie that cares for its characters and plot.  Crazy Heart tells the story of Bad Blake (Jeff Bridges) a washed-out country singer who's not a very likeable guy. He curses, drinks, and very lazy. He use to be the top dog in country but we can just tell he screw that up. His agent clearly forces him and yells at him to get up and do a performance and not to f@#k it up. He refuses to collaborate with another country singer named Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) which we get a notion of a disagreement between them from the past. Bridges performance is so good that we can tell the age of experience from his actions and mannerisms. We can tell his sadness from his actions with the way he acts and his judgments. All of these things start to change once he meet Jean Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal) a writer and her son. At first is sexual but then he starts falling for her and for his son. He decides to reinvent his life and people it's not easy for him.  Bridge's performance is downright awesome and finally the recognition he deserves. He comes from a huge career of movies and he nailed this one. He created a character that was believable. There were times when we wanted to cry for him and when we were angry with him. The supporting cast was very good as well. Gyllenhaal was very good and gave a very good supportive role. Colin Farrell as well who does more action flicks shows that he has more meaning and dramatic depths. Yeah the plot is familiar with music stars but the performances form the actors rise to another level. I think this movie shines a light on movies where we lost the effect that movie does for us. This is a movie who has important things to say, films are suppose to be teach aspects of life and to entertain. Some movies are satires and some movies are protests. You want to know what Crazy Heart teaches, see it yourself and let it teach you.  One of the best films of 2009."

However, you can extract the pain from Jeff's performance alone.  He was extremely worthy of his Best Actor Oscar.  While I've seen him in a rugged role before, he takes a character that is clearly meant to exhibit a painful presence and, in spite of the strength of the story, makes you see and almost feel his pain."

The film never quite spikes with enough energy aside from Bridges singing the same song over and over throughout the duration.

The cast turn in a real mixed bag of performances. Despite the acclaim he received for the role of Bad Blake, I felt Jeff Bridges tended to coast through the film, churning out a re-hash of his washed-up loser \"greatest hits\". With the addition of a bored-looking Robert Duvall, and the ridiculously miscast Colin Farrell, Crazy Heart would be in danger of becoming a thoroughly unmemorable viewing experience, but thankfully it has a saving grace in a emotional, rousing performance from Maggie Gyllenhaal. Despite being a scene-stealer, her character, the single mother and music journalist Jean Craddock, makes some unbelievably poor choices of judgement that threaten to make the whole film's narrative laughable - I don't care how much you like country music, Jeanie, what on Earth would attract you that fat, alcoholic windbag in the first place, let alone make you think it was a good idea to let him look after your kid? In all fairness, Crazy Heart does get much better towards the end. From it's pretentious and plodding beginnings, it eventually becomes something watchable, has a pleasing story arc of downfall and redemption, and, perhaps most importantly, Bridges looks and sounds like a country music star. In the end, though it may have  the odd glimmer of brilliance, Crazy Heart isn't anything special. If I wanted to watch an engaging and entertaining film about country music, I'd choose Walk the Line over this any day."

Crazy Heart follows the music biopic formula from start to finish and never deviates, showcasing all the classic trademarks: classic songs, broken friendships, failed relationships, and alcoholism. Aside from Bridges, the acting is good, but Crazy Heart's narrative formula is tried and true. While conventional, it is a good take on the music \"biopic\" formula and is a thoroughly entertaining film, heartbreaking at times, plus it has great music. That said, Crazy Heart is most certainly not too original and is far too typical to be better than pretty good to good.

When he least expected it, he finds in a young aspiring journalist who wanted to interview him a strong and revolutionary love interest that makes him see life with a new spirit and change his bad habits and vices.For me, to date, it is the most notable film in Jeff Bridges' extensive filmography. He, more than any other, carries the film on his back and assumes an unequivocal protagonism, which he would already have for the character he assumes, but reinforces through a colossal performance. It is worth seeing this film just for him, and to hear the elegant and tuned way in which the actor sang in the film ... and I am not even fond of country. Maggie Gyllenhaal also makes a good contribution and collaborates quite well with the actor.Technically, the film works quite well but knows how to be discreet, giving the actors the necessary space and the story told to stand out in the public eye. Cinematography is the standard, but it has excellent footage from concerts and musical performances. The soundtrack makes good use of country songs."

    {
      "rating": "8",
      "text": "This is a drama film with obviously a heavy emphasis on music, more specifically country music and it features themes including reconciliation, personal identity, loneliness and of course country music. It is very much a character focussed drama. The main character, Bad (who is very hesitant to reveal his real name, I should note), is depicted from early on as quite a disillusioned person. We learn slowly about his history, via the love interest, Jean the journalist. Given his fame and adoration, its surprising to see that he lives a relatively modest life, keeping himself to himself most of the time. I found it hard to fully follow what Bad said at times, as his voice sounded quite mumbly - perhaps its (partly) because of his thick US accent. I often found myself tinkering with the volume to try and improve things, only to find a new scene starting with music playing and the music was too loud, so I'd turn it down, only to find myself, yet again, a bit unclear of the dialogue when it cut to a quieter scene, which is quite frustrating!. Whether thats anything to do with me watching it via my laptop, as I purchased it via Google Play, or not, I don't know but it was quite distracting and so I felt I better mention it.The plot is pretty slow paced, infact I'm not sure if it was very clear quite what the plot was, certainly direction wise, at all. I found it (personally) a pretty easy watch, as I'm relatively keen on contemporary country music and I quite enjoyed the songs Bad performs (I believe the actor, Jeff Bridges, performs himself during the film, so its not a case of lip syncing or dubbing, which impressed me - some of the lyrics are relatively poignant) plus I don't mind a decent film centering on character development but this may not suit all, as some may find this a bit slow and meandering. I think its fair to say that this is quite a, what you might call, reflective film - with various people, mostly other musicians, looking back at things in the music industry and in their individual lives and perhaps wondering what may have been. It may seem a bit indulgent to some but I thought it was somewhat philosophical and I found it a pleasant enough watch regardlress.Content wise, this film contains some strong language plus a scene involving a crash in which a character is left with injuries, part bloody ones although nothing especially graphic is shown. Bad is depicted as drinking and being inebriated at times and also people are seen smoking, which may not be something you'd want younger teenagers to see, if you think they may be influenced by such things but there are no other drug related references or scenes and no graphic sexual content either, although some mild nudity. Also I wouldn't say that drinking and smoking is glamourised as such either, the down sides to such over indulgences being made fairly clear. Regardless, due to this, the film carries a 15 rating here in the UK. The 15 rating slightly surprised me as I would have thought it would be ok with a 12a rating, for the language, given there isn't a great amount of violence but I suppose the higher rating is, if partly, due to the amount of smoking and alcohol taking depicted.The film contains a definite bittersweet feel to it, particularly towards the end as certain discoveries are made, although I won't go in to any details so as not to spoil the film for anyone who hasn't seen it, of course. I thought this was a well made film which is relatively thoughtful.Yes I'd recommend it overall, as long as you don't mind possibly relying on using the subtitles on ocassion and as long as you don't mind character based dramas, as this is just about one of the better ones. It may seem a little bland and it doesn't feature any big visual effects or anything but the main performance by Jeff Bridges is a solid one and I liked the music featured throughout and found it to be a good watch, if a rather sobering one."
