Yes it's certainly far from groundbreaking or amazing, but it's also not the terrible God-awful film everyone else wants you to believe it is. It's still a stupid fun time while it lasts. I feel as though most critics and audiences have been exaggerating their opinions on how terrible they think this film is, maybe that's just me though."

      "text": "Never though that Statham will perform as Bishop again after The Mechanic in 2011 (that was a disappointment). The reason that i wanna see this sequel is the cast. Is not just Statham alone but along with Tommy Lee Jones (Academy Award winner), Jessica Alba and international martial actress from Malaysia - Michelle Yeoh.\r The story begins with Bishop that begin to enjoy his retirement - tired and sick of all the murderers he planned but then a beautiful Thai girl approached him and offering 3 jobs or get killed. but off course Bishop easily handled this girl and the thugs she bring along with her through a brutal hand combat and escape.\r Then Bishop move far away to Thailand and warmly welcomed by his old friend - Mei (Michelle Yeoh).Then soon Bishop reluctantly have to save an attractive girl - Gina (Jessica Alba) whom being beaten by a guy named Frank - just to find out that all was just a set up to spying on him. But, Bishop got another plan, since he already know who behind all this, he intend to finish this once and for all.\r Then Bishop meet Crain, a man who hold his grudge upon Bishop for so long - but want Bishop to do 3 hard tasks - murder high profiles villains - but with his expertise - the killing must look like accident.\r Bishop easily finished his 2 first tasks - but then he realized that Crain got something behind this all schemes. So,he decide to collaborate with the 3rd target - Max Adams (Tommy Lee Jones), the most powerful gun dealers in all Europea Continent.\r Again, that this sequel still far from my expectation. I was hope that this sequel will bring more escalation on every aspect, the characters, the conflicts, character development. But, turn out to be only 2 element added to this sequel 1)Bishop's love story and 2)action package.\r I do really like some \"humour\" elements inserted but still not enough to make me Laugh Out Loud. Also i was really keen when Bishop finally find out that Gina reluctantly \"working\" for Crain, but then just so easily Bishop finally fall in love with Gina. A person like Bishop.\r I really enjoy when Bishop create the accident to kill Cook. And that was really original idea (at least from where i belong).\r But the funny thing is : the terms of the assignment was the killing must 100% look like accident or Crain will kill Gina. The 1st task was done not really look like accident.\r The other thing, i always enjoy Tommy Lee Jones perform as Max Adams. His performance reminds me of his perform in Under Siege...eccentric but i can feel the vicious behind it. But then, that just it..this sequel didn't give enough space to develop Max's character.\r Guess, The Mechanic Resurrcetion is just another typical action movie will be soon forgotten as you put your feet into your doorstep or maybe soon as you leave the building."

      "text": "A clich\u00e9 plot doesn't always mean death for an action movie. As long as the star, stunts, and fights are up to snuff then viewers can still find themselves having a good time. While the movie provides some thrilling moments, Statham's Mechanic sequel ultimately falls short thanks to a strange focus on acting and storytelling. Both of which aren't handled very well.Despite his pedigree, Statham isn't unfamiliar with more story-driven action flicks. Take Homefront for example, which did a pretty great job of juggling both character-driven writing and the star's remarkable physicality. Here though the amount of predictability is just painful. The emphasis on the romance between Statham and Abla is where this is most notable. It's also punctuated by awful dialog and the fact that Abla just can't act. The action is mostly solid though. When things finally get going it's almost enough to make you forget about how bad everything else is. It's even quite fun at times. The hits themselves Statham is forced to pull of are quite exciting and inventive. Near the end it starts to rely on formulaic shoot outs, but at least that's better than the writing. Plus you're treated to some gorgeous scenery. Of course even that gets hurt by some bad green screen and CGI work here and there. There are times where you can clearly see the budget restraints. The direction also seems a tad amateurish. Did we really need those lengthy fade to blacks before the next scene? At times though this is actually a strength. It (unintentionally) harkens back to those cheesy action hits of the 80's. When it comes to action movies there are plenty of better alternatives out there. However there are also plenty of worse ones as well. But why waste your time with something so middling? Ultimately this just serves as a reminder of why Statham isn't exactly as big of a name as he could be. He's got the presence and skills, but so far he just hasn't had the movies.5.9/10"

He's backed into a corner, thanx partly to his quick romance with Jessica Alba, who's basically reduced to being the damsel in distress. As expected, he kicks ass and kills plenty, but this sequel has him setting more traps and creating elaborate schemes. There's less hand-to-hand fighting, which is his strength. What fights are there, aren't often special. Statham fans will probably enjoy his steely character and some good moves, but will find less cool action than expected."

      "text": "Falling in love is a trap, but some men risk everything for it.This is an unexpected sequel. Actually, I was looking for other sequels from Statham's filmography, particularly the third 'Crank'. I think the idea of going for it was good and the film was not that bad, if your purpose of a watch is time pass. The story was so bad, but the filmmaking was excellent. Because it was made by a renowned German director. Only if he had got a better script, the outcome would have been different. So it's the actors and the director makes it watchable. Other than that, this film falls into the average category.The story follows after Arthur Bishop was found living in Brasil by some people who know him. Then he narrowly escapes from there and lands in Southeast Asia, where he meets Gina, a woman struggling from domestic violence. But he soon discovers that's a setup. After she was taken captive by an international criminal, now he has to follow his instruction to set her free. So the action begins where he takes a series of missions across the globe and how it all ends follows in the rest of the narration,It's good to see Jason Statham back to his signature role. This is what he's good at. Even if the story is not good, that's okay, because Statham's presence is a very comfortable to watch without any trouble. Jessica Alba as well, I haven't seen her in any major hit film at the recent time. Even though the film was received below average, it kind of puts them both back on the track.Definitely they both needed this breakthrough. There's a third film is coming, it's not official yet, but the conclusion was a hint where Tommy Lee Jones can be seen in an important role in the next part. You won't like this film, but surely enjoy it if you are a Statham's fan, that's the only reason to go for it.6/10"

Resurrection messes up the straight forward formula of making a Jason Statham film, and injects the sequel with boring fistfights/gunplay, a terrible plot and downright cringe worthy dialogue. There are a few scenes that are very well shot, and choreographed. Even though every actor in the film is a letdown, I always saw a bored Tommy Lee Jones who could have made for a weekend ticket. Some action setpieces, especially the ones on the yacht, are exciting and exhilirating. Sadly, those 30 minutes cannot cover up the mess that is Mechanic: Resurrection. It is boring, lousy and loud, and really makes you want cover your ears with pillows."

      "text": "If you're in the mood, Mechanic Resurrection is a great guilty pleasure. No one was clamoring for a sequel of Jason Statham's remake of the 70's Charles Bronson assassin flick, but here it is anyway. The opening is a kind of homage/rip off of a James Bond open, with an actually well staged fight in a restaurant that moves to the top of a suspended railcar and ends with our hero jumping off and landing on the back of a passing hang-glider (holy Roger Moore!). From there, Statham meets activist Jessica Alba, where after an evening of giggling (which I guess passes as chemistry) they fall into bed/love together. She gets kidnapped and Statham is forced to assassinate three targets to make up the rest of the movie. The \"hits\" are rushed, for time, and a lot of detail is looked over. The prison hit alone could have been a movie by itself. And for an assassin that specializes in \"accidents\", he sure kills A LOT of people in the traditional ways, plenty of gunfire. Statham attacks the villain's boat at one point, kills about 50 henchmen, gets captured, and is forced to perform the last hit (after killing about half of the villain's men). It's that kind of movie."

It was just basically Statham trying to save a damsel in distress (Jessica Alba). The hero does best when he has little dialogue.  And there is little meaningful dialogue in this film.  Just action.  And the acting isn't very good.  Alba is terrible in this film. Maybe she just couldn't shine in a movie lacking a plot and in which her role is simplistic.   But if you like the lead actor, and you like violence, this is your film.  For people who demand an intelligent plot and better acting, it's not. Killing people in dramatic ways.  Lots and lots of killing. Poor acting.  That's the gist of this film.  And there's not much more."

I've heard many people give this movie a free pass because it's just Jason Statham spouting out one-liners.  Well, just because it's entertaining doesn't mean it's good.  There's no substance to the film, it's literally just J-Statham fighting bad guys in disorienting camera shots, terrible green-screen shots, and terrible special effects.  Sprinkle that in with some laughably bad acting and forced romance that you hardly buy, and you have a movie that you can get wasted on.  I can understand if you want to give it a good score and call it a guilty pleasure movie, but you have to understand that this is NOT a good movie.  From a critical standpoint, this movie is complete garbage.  However, if you wanna have fun with some buddies, crack open a few cold ones and enjoy the hilarity.\r The Mechanic: Resurrection gets a 2/10."
