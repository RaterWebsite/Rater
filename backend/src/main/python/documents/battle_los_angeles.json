I liked how the aliens didn't have \"Energy Shields\" or \"Laser Rifles\" and weren't neigh-invulnerable. I question some of the alien's choice of tactics though, and you'd think that somebody in Hollywood who was looking to make a non-typical alien movie would have trashed the \"We've got to destroy the enemy's heavily defended weak point, with out handful of regular GI Joes\" storyline.Also, this movie has Michelle Rodriguez in it, playing the only role she has ever played. \"The tough girl in a male-dominated role that doesn't take ****"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Lets be honest Battle: Los Angeles is hardly a breakthrough movie, infact it doesn't offer anything that we haven't seen before but all the negativity shown towards it is really blown out of proprtion! Its not the best sci-fi, alien invasion movie i've ever seen but its far from the worst. The film begins with a mysterious objects, initially believed to be meteors crashing into some of the worlds biggest cities oceans however the objects turn out to be spacecraft carrying extra terrestials who have began attacks around the world. Set in modern day LA the film follows a platoon of US Marines fighting for Los Angeles. The one thing the film has in its favour is that it does seem realistic. The setting is stunning particuarly in showing a decimated LA where the action set-pieces work wonderfully and are the best features within the film as its explosion after explosion. Theres no real standout performances although Aaron Eckhart is good in the lead role not his finest hour but he puts in a solid enough performance. Overall, Battle: Los Angeles is hardly revolutionary and there have been better films under this genre (District 13) and it is a bit predictable as most people will have seen it all before however that doesn't make this a bad film. Visually its marvellous and the explosive shootouts are excellent. Won't be for everyone but for action/sci-fi fans you can't go wrong!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This movie is severely underrated.

This movie just got right into the action and stuck with it. It added drama that everyone thrives on in a movie like this. The cast was interesting. But there performances were great.

Go Marines."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "It's funny how almost every military person who has seen this film applauds it for its great combat realism, right down to the gear and lingo used.  Anyone (like Ebert) who missed that is detached from reality probably by, ironically, watching too many movies and can't even recognized that the dialogue and character development in this film is realistic and appropriate for the situation given.

The movie reminds me a bit of a video game (e.g. Call of Duty) the way some scenes are played out. The story is very enjoyable to learn and the action scenes in the film are enjoyable to watch. My only problem with this film is the film could have gone into more detail about the invasion then just always just on the army. One thing is for sure, Battle: Los Angeles is way better then Skyline. I would give this a high matinee!"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "I walked into Battle Los Angeles hoping for a different alien invasion film. One that would be both creative yet action packed. I walked out somewhat happy. Battle Los Angeles in short, is the same ol' story you've heard 100's of times before. Aliens have come to planet Earth and they are not nice, they have one thing in mine, destruction of the human race. Enter Aaron Eckhart's character, (who for the life of me I can't remember the man's name) an old ravaged marine who has a notorious reputation for reasons I won't discuss (part of the story). But the thing is, Battle LA distinguishes itself from the alien film crowd because it feels more like a an action packed, adrenaline pumped, war flick. Put it this way, if you tried to combine Saving Private Ryan and Skyline, with the hand held camera of Cloverfield, you pretty much get Battle Los Angeles. (*hint* this movie is twenty times better than Skyline) From then on the story kicks off and gets very intense, heartpounding, and emotional. Most of the film coincides into absolutely brilliantly shot firefights and shootouts with a gritty and mature feel. And that's about it, Battle Los Angeles doesn't feature a story that will blow you out of the water, but incredible action sequences. However the acting in Battle LA is pretty good, mainly because of Aaron Eckhart, who absolutely outdoes himself on all accounts, only everybody will be thinking of Two Face when they see his character. There is however one very, very, very emotional moment where many loose ends are tied up and it ends in a bittersweet, sad, but beautiful moment where Aaron Eckhart delivers the speech of a lifetime. The last thing worth mentioning is the ending which leaves something to be desired. It's not that it's bad, it's just that you feel left robbed of an ending that actually \"feels\" like an ending, one that ties it up more. Overall Battle Los Angeles is the movie I was hoping for, but not as creative, story driven, or as much of an end of force I had hoped for."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I find it quite interesting how low rated this movie is JUST because it is a meddle of all-too-common subjects and cliches. People tend to forget that the best stories are often repeated to exhaustion every other year with a different tweak and a different cast, and they still go and clamor each title - yet, for this movie, \"more of the same\" was seen as negative. It has all the best elements of a good sci-fi, of a good drama, and of a good movie, and the fact it's long and try to engage you with the characters, while not that all successful, is a merit to this movie. Yes you have seen this movie before dozens of times with different names, but that's exactly why this is so good: it does not try to set itself apart from \"all of those other invasion movies\", instead, it munches all the good qualities and point of views together to make a WHOLE experience. It's not just the point of view of some survivors, not just the point of view of some mariners, not the point of view of the President, not even the point of view of a joe-doe with a camera - it's all of that, together, and with a fine print: the aliens MAKE SENSE, their goals MAKE SENSE, the strategies MAKE SENSE, and how mankind try to fight back MAKE SENSE - that, alone, sets this movie apart, and way above, most of the others. Perhaps it's too smart and logic to critics or the common viewer, but those looking for more, this is it, THE invasion movie, period. Why I rate it 9 and not 10? because the movie failed at MARKETING and telling people this movie was a different take on the invasion subject, and not just \"another\" invasion movie."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Just watched it on Blu-ray and.................i was surprised by how much better it is than the critics claim.

The aggressively handheld nature of the camera is an immediate callback to Cloverfield, while the situation of Marines fighting it out in a wartorn urban battlefield is exactly like BHD. District Nine's excellent visual realization of CGI extraterrestrials merged almost seamlessly with live action is repeated here, along with some rather gory dissection of said aliens.Black Hawk Down's legacy is all over this film. While BHD was a masterpiece of a war film and Battle LA is not as good, there are a lot of borrowed elements. The epic visual of numerous helicopters flying in formation while the camera slowly pans around them worked wonderfully in Ridley Scott's film, and it does so again here. Also, there's a shot of a rocket flying through a window and exploding directly behind Michelle Rodriguez's character. Again, instant callback to BHD. The operatic action beats that BHD nailed so well are faithfully utilized by Jonathan Liebesman to deliver a satisfying and meaty action experience.At first, you're just watching very blurry, dusty, murky... out of focus shots of the aliens, and you might start to worry and wonder and fret. I sure did. You're worried that they probably didn't have the budget to show the aliens in all their glory, and we'd just get quick glimpses of their features. Either the CGI technology wasn't good enough or convincing enough or they just couldn't afford to show it. Well, they quickly lay that fear to rest, because after the initial firefight, you do get to see the aliens in all their gooey, cybernetic glory. It feels like they learned from District Nine, with a mostly convincing and believable visual of CGI aliens fighting with real actors in a physical location. The film as a whole is not the thoughtful meditation that D9 was, but the borrowing of its impressive technical innovation is clearly on display.I've mentioned Cloverfield, so we've gotta talk about the shaky cam. It's the most defining element of that film. How do they use it here? Well...the shaky cam does come on a bit strong. You need to strike a good balance, in order to capture that authentic in-the-moment experience, without overwhelming the audience with dizzying blurs that get annoying and nauseating. For the most part, the shaky cam makes sense, with the camera shaking around when the cameraman runs with the Marines to cover, or the jittering of a shaky chopper ride with turbulence. Those all make sense and the film gets better with it as it goes on.However, the beginning of the film did annoy me with its shaky cam, simply because the scenes were all taking place before the invasion and there was no need for all the motion. Like, we're watching a scene of two guys talking in an office, with one of the guys telling the other that he's leaving the service. There's no need for that camera to wobble. Or watching a Marine walk toward a grave. Again, why is the camera wobbling so much? The cameraman is stationary, is he trembling for some reason? Are his nerves acting up? Does he have Parkinson's? It becomes distracting. Once the film moves past this prologue and gets right into the action, the shaky cam is mostly fine, except for the ride in the APC near the end of the film. At first I thought it was a Bradley, because they mentioned the Bushmaster 25mm chaingun, but it actually looks like a LAV, which makes sense as that's a Marine vehicle. That scene was in the dark and the cuts were so fast and shaky that you mostly just saw a lot of blurs and couldn't really tell what was happening. It really began to feel like some action scenes in Batman Begins. This is no good, when your audience notices that they aren't seeing enough and start to wonder exactly what's happening. That's when the shaky cam goes too far and fails as a visual technique.An unavoidable aspect of the film that leaps to mind are the cliches. There are so many cliches in here, it's almost hard to count. Martinez, the hispanic Lt, says goodbye to his pregnant wife. Well, you know that guy's gonna die. Of course, he's a green Lt right out of school who doesn't have experience and requires the seasoned staff sergeant to help him out. There's a black marine with dorky glasses who's about to get married. Surprisingly, he doesn't die. The lines are pretty hilarious in how cliched and overused they are. Some examples like, \"You are to kill anything that's not human!\" and \"That was some John Wayne **** you just pulled\" and \"Let it out. It's okay to cry. Your father was a brave man.\" I'm paraphrasing here from memory, so those lines may not be 100% accurate, but you get the general gist. It's a very well-trodden path here."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Tralha voado para todo o lado e com uma hist\u00f3ria incrivelmente mal feita, e efeitos visuais n\u00e3o t\u00e3o legai.

The only real let down for me was the beginning because it could have been so much better, very little time was devoted to the aliens landing on earth and being seen for the first time, within minutes of the start of the film,  Los Angeles is almost decimated, aliens ae briefly seen on a fuzzy  tv news report marching and you are thrown into the action with almost no build up.

If this movie had named like speilberg , bay, or Abrams in the credits, you all would have given it high scores.  Shame on all you low baller critics, the ones paid off, and the main stream name droppers for ignoring the thrill of this movie.  I watched it twice so far, my wife as well, and plan on purchasing the bluray which I don't often do.  It will sit beside Lost, star trek, star wars, WITH PRIDE!"}], "recommendations": ["independence_day", "pacific_rim", "the_matrix_revolutions", "elysium", "the_day_after_tomorrow", "the_matrix_reloaded", "reign_of_fire", "riddick", "mortal_engines", "the_tomorrow_war", "surrogates", "red_tails", "infinite", "the_darkest_hour", "transformers_dark_of_the_moon", "captive_state", "midway", "london_has_fallen", "underworld_blood_wars", "mad_max_fury_road", "300_rise_of_an_empire", "pandorum", "jupiter_ascending", "monsters", "abraham_lincoln_vampire_hunter"]}
