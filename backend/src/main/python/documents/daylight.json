Mine did. But, it's not, and I'm thankful. It's a suspense film, aka, a thriller. This is kidnap story done sans the clich\u00e9s, meaning, it's done slow and methodically, like peeling back the layers of an onion. A married couple working through some issues pick up a hitchhiker and the movie ensues. The hitchhiker isn't working alone, and his isnt too stable either. One minute he's compassionate, the next minute he's ruthless. Is he going to find \"faith\"? Is he going to reject mercy? You never know if he and his partner in crime are going to \"turn a new leaf\" and become \"the good guys\" or if they're going to follow the traditional knife-wielding route and be killers. The score compliments the vibe here well, and the length of the movie is just right. Any longer would run the risk of filler. It's worth a rent, but I think that's all one can do as I don't see it available on Blu-ray anywhere."}], "recommendations": ["identity", "escape_room_tournament_of_champions", "vehicle_19", "the_rental", "21_bridges", "cellular", "the_crazies", "the_purge_anarchy", "i_see_you", "the_call", "the_hurricane_heist", "the_purge", "vacancy", "secret_window", "alone", "28_weeks_later", "paranormal_activity_the_marked_ones", "evil_eye", "the_autopsy_of_jane_doe", "texas_chainsaw_3d", "the_toll", "reasonable_doubt", "limitless", "spiral_from_the_book_of_saw", "the_forest"]}
