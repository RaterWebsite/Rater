It's characters, both new and old, are very likable, the humor is pretty good when present, and the action is fun. It's a perfectly serviceable movie, better than most of DC's recent efforts, but it still has a long ways to go."

You\u2019ll find out very soon.. here only.. :PSo, Justice League.. Hmmm.. Why DC.? WHY.? One good movie, all the critics around the world was Happy after you gave us Wonder Woman.. And next  WHY Snyder.? After watching his (this) 3rd debacle, I say \u201cHE SHOULD RETIRE FROM DIRECTION.\u201d Disappointed Direction as usual.. :D->>> Things I liked:-~ 2-3 Superb sequences with Flash.. As you all know, \u201cSUPERMAN LIVES\u201d Yippyyy.. :3 And Yes, I mentioned Superman.. In Flash\u2019s column.!! Watch the surprise in theater ;)~ Villain was Powerful. I thought without Superman, others don\u2019t stand a chance defeating him.. And what is Justice League w/o Superman.? Pfffff.. :D~ And WONDER WOMAN :* :3->>> Disappointed Things (there is global audience for Things I didn\u2019t like so):-~ Aqua-man was Okay Man.. :D He didn\u2019t do anything with \u201cAqua\u201d as his name suggests, rather than swimming in ocean for trailer purposes.. :D~ Cyborg had some more scenes than Aquaman.. Just more scenes.. Nothing exciting there..~ Flash has sequences BUT other than that, his comic timing was FLAT. I did\u2019t chuckle \u2018much\u2019 at his jokes. TV\u2019s Flash Grant Gustin is Way Much Better..~ Batman\u2019s butler Alfred, Superman\u2019s Girl Miss Lane, His Mom Martha, Commissioner Gordon, Cyborg\u2019s Dad, Amber Heard :D all of them had minor screen time..~ I was surprised to see Batman & WW also didn\u2019t have much exciting screen presence.. You know, when you see a Superhero, it should Feel like Superhero.. Or at least a human being with their respective flaws.. But DC has this Special Ability to Overdramatize scenes.. Well done..Hufffff.. At last, want to say, Enjoyed fight sequences, Flash\u2019s sequences & Wonder Woman ;) :3 :*Rating is.. No drum rolls this time.. Better if you\u2019re drunk..Peace V"

Although some of the CGI and the rapid pace of action scenes were a bit letting off towards the last act, the league stands out as a whole on whose shoulders the movie marches well forward. Every character shines and makes this movie worth investing your time at the cinemas whether regardless of being a comic book fan or mainstream. Ezra's Flash was a real charm and not to mention Superman's actual moment which was the biggest USP that satisfies hardcore fans like myself."

The movie is epic, maintains its' serious tone, and still manages to make you laugh with humor without it becoming a parody. You can definitely see Joss Whedon's additions to the movie which lightens Snyder's more serious tone. I read some of the reviews from critics and I had to wonder if we even saw the same movie."

      "text": "\"Justice League\" is a rather flawed movie. Its pacing often feels rushed (thanks to Warner Bros' insistence that the movie be under 2 hours), the CGI is painfully obvious (some of the post-production work on Clark's face is meme bait), and Steppenwolf isn't exactly a villain to write home about. That said, it's also got plenty of entertainment value. It's considerably lighter than Zack Snyder's other two DCEU films, the characters all have good chemistry with one another and are given their own moment to shine, and it's exciting in that \"superheroes coming together to save the world\" way, much like \"The Avengers\" was. If you've dreamed your whole life of seeing the Justice League come together on the big screen, you're unlikely to be disappointed, so long as you adjust your expectations."

Reshoots and CGI could perhaps have been better in places, but in what movie in this decade isn't that the case? I also missed the Zimmer music in places it would have fit nicely, including the cornfield scene where one of the Man of Steel pieces was used. That's all that really bothered me, other than the film could have perhaps been longer. Batman was a pleasure to watch. Wonder Woman has several amazing moments. The Flash was funny and endearing. Aquaman managed to actually make me interested in his upcoming film, and that alone is a feat, as he was never a character that interested me. A certain someone was the 'S'tar of it all, as I believe was always intended, and more how people wished him. Steppenwolf served his purpose of being a menacing plot device to frame the formation of the League, also.Just seeing the League interact on screen, and mythical heroes duking it out in ways and on a scale you just don't see elsewhere, was a pleasure. I plan to see the movie several more times."

This movie shows the hero in there more pure way, caring about the people and saving them. the action scenes, the league working together are just wonderful to watch. The story is simple, the villain is nothing new, although that i like it, it semmed like a semi-boss, felt threatening and you believed that he could destroy all members of the league, almost. The movie shows hope and optimism, a lot of jokes and light moments that worked well in the most. I really enjoyed watching this movie and when i get out of the movie theater i was just smilling around."

      "text": "The beginning of the movie is a bit bumpy but when the movie starts to pick up, it really does shine. The chemistry between the members of the Justice League and how they work together is amazing to see on the big screen. The cgi for Steppenwolf looks straight from a video game. If you thought Ares in Wonder Woman was bad, this is even worst but seeing them beat the **** out of him makes it up. This is a lot more lighter in tone compared to the other DC movies and its definitely in the right direction. There is some hints of studio meddling by making them cut it down to around 2 hours which ruins the pacing of the film. The scene stealers have to be Jason Mamoa as Aquaman and Ezra Miller as The Flash and someone else which I cannot say to avoid spoilers. There is a particular scene where The Flash and this person interacts that had the whole theater roaring in laughter like how the Hulk interacted with Loki in The Avengers. The score is a really big treat for this film. Danny Elfman incorporates themes of the past that we are familiar with into this score like the original Superman theme and of course Tim Burtons Batman theme. This is a really fun movie and I highly recommend people to give it a try even if they thought the last couple movies were lame because this movie is getting a bunch of bad rep due to the critics score. Do not let bias pre meditated opinions dictate your choice of seeing this film just because you love Marvel more than DC. You can like both and it is possible. Thor Ragnorak was a fun ride and I enjoyed it and Justice League is also a really fun ride also. PS: There is 2 stinger after credit scenes at the end."

      "text": "Justice League is the culmination of a grand total of three movies (Discounting Suicide Squad), where our beloved DC characters band together and forms the eponymous league. It offers bite-sized bits of fun in its action and character dialogue, but ultimately proves to be a clumsy attempt at brightening up the atmosphere of Snyder's DC universe. It is unrewarding and shallow at anything it tries to explore.-THEME-The film opens with an amateur recording of Cavill's Superman, offering his cheerful wisdom (of which he had none in his previous two films) in a dialogue about hope and car keys, suggesting that the central theme of the movie is hope. And since his passing in BvS, the world was rocked into anxiety and distress.This theme, however, was never explored any further. The movie never shows the emotion of hope draining or rejuvenating our characters. In the end, the movie has no theme to revolve around, resorting instead into a mindless fight of good and evil, where our heroes race to stop Steppenwolf in his conquest to gather three loot boxes and destroy the earth... for no reason other than \"because I am Steppenwolf\".-CHARACTERS-Steppenwolf himself proved to be a very forgettable wet blanket of a villain, with one-note dialogue that revolves around the words \"box\" and \"destroy\". He does not provide the protagonists with moral or philosophical quandary.On the other hand, a few of our protagonists (specifically Miller\u2019s Barry Allen, Gadot\u2019s Wonder Woman, and Momoa\u2019s Aquaman) provided the movie with its better parts. The movie is at its strongest points when it explores their characters, allowing us glimpses into the kinds of people each of the Leaguers are. This endeavour proved shallow because none of them were never really presented with a conflict that challenges their beliefs. Having spent much of their earlier screen time as friends who have nothing to challenge the others about, the culmination of the story fizzles unrewardingly as they \u201cfinally\u201d unite against their common foe. There is no buildup, no lessons learned by anyone, that led to this point.Much like Wonder Woman in BvS, Superman felt like an item on a checklist. His resurrection was \u2013 say it with me \u2013 unrewarding. The impact of his death was not explored sufficiently. The impact and consequences of his resurrection seemed trivial. Justice League was an unrewarding experience, and if you don\u2019t care enough for action blockbusters or superero films, you\u2019re off not spending any time and money for this movie. Snyder/DC\u2019s diehard fans will still find some things to enjoy in this movie."

And that's how it is with this movie as well. Noticeable flaws, compensated by powerful moments and some touches of genius. Snyder's determination is evident, as he and the cast combine to produce a dedicated performance that shines even through Joss Whedon's honestly appalling reshoots and vulgar humour. Plagued by a meh villain, a rushed plot and some deus ex machina; Justice League is buoyed by five determined performances, great character interactions and one, VERY incredible Superman.A must watch for all."

I can't believe how the DCEU has the ability to ruin comic book cinematic events, with Batman v Superman, they ruined what should've been the most awaited moment for comic book fans, the comic book crossover of the century, and they turned it into a pretentious, boring, convoluted mess of a movie and now with Justice League they ruined what should've been THE comic book crossover of the century and turned it into a convoluted, unfunny, cheap-looking, boring movie.But it was kind of expected, the DCEU was already ruined and all the messes they made with previous movies would naturally make this movie turn out to be pretty bad.The pacing is just horrible, the plot is generic and clich\u00e9 (Oh, the villain has to get an item that will make him destroy the universe how creative), there's no character development, the Justice League has zero chemistry and there's no conflict. Like, everyone is just okay with being a team now, they're all happy and good friends now and will destroy Steppenwolf together. Steppenwolf is one of the most generic and clich\u00e9 villains I've ever seen since Apocalypse from X-Men Apocalypse, I swear 99% of his lines are clich\u00e9 villain lines and even the way the actor portrays him is clich\u00e9 and cartoonish.The CGI is TERRIBLE and makes Cyborg look awkward to watch, and you might say it's not that bad but it is considering the HUGE budget this movie was made with.Batman is wasted and that's one of the worst things in this movie, Batman was awesome in Batman v Superman and was one of the only goof things about that movie but here, he's just there, he doesn't do anything, he barely has any screentime when he's in the Batman suit.Nothing about this movie is good and it's one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen, I expected so much from this movie and that just makes my feelings about this movie even worse.

Stepwolf n\u00e3o tem nada disso e bastou o superhomen chegar para levar uma tareia brutal. Simplesmente ridiculo.
