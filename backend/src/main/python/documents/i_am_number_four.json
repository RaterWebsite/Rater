You would think that there would be a nice story and lore behind the cool action. There isn't thought. This movie never makes up it's mind if it wants to be a cool action flick, or a drama film, and it ends up falling short on both ends. The action scenes are too few and far apart to hold the movie together. The story never really gets going and leaves so much unanswered. The main character being an alien is an excuse to not explain most of the plot points. The story is also filled with that cheap, overused 20-something year olds acting like they're in a fictional high school setting stereotype. Bullies that induce physical violence? Check. Nerds with no self esteem? Check. Main character that FIST PUMPS AFTER KISSING A GIRL? Check...The movie could have been a lot more, but stopped short.

And it was entertaining too. Don't expect to be surprised by any great plot twists, but if you dig superhero movies then you should probably check it out. Besides these stupid published critics don't like anything unless it's some dreary melodrama and even then they probably only say they like that stuff in case it wins an award.

I have no idea what's wrong with all these critics. This movie is awesome! OK so the movie follows John Smith(played by Alex Pettyfer) who is an alien part of a group of nine of his kind that escaped his planet before they were killed. Numbers one, two, and three are dead, so now the Mog are coming after him. He has to find a way to stop them or he's next. Do you wanna see this now? No? What's your problem? Lets get the story straight though. This is not a Twilight remake/rip-off. Yes, I can see some resemblances to Twilight but it really isn't like that at all. Alex Pettyfer was very good for his first big movie. He does his part very well and doesn't slip up. The girl he falls in love with, Sarah, played by Dianna Agron does fine but nothing really special. Number Six, played by Teresa Palmer does a great job in her role. She is just an awesome, gun wielding alien. But the man who steals the show is Timothy Olyphant who plays Henri, John's protector. Timothy Olyphant is always cool and awesome, but give him a sword and he is the ultimate badass in this movie. The script, to my surprise, was very well written. everything makes sense and there isn't and cringe-worthy dialogue. The special effects were spectacular. Everything from the lights coming out of his hands to the monsters he fights are extremely well done. My only gripe, and this is a very small one, is that the villains weren't really developed much. They were just there, I wish we learned more about them. But again, that is a very minor thing. Overall, I Am Number Four is the movie I have been waiting for since the start of the year. Definitely my favorite movie of the year so far."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Entertaining sci-fi chick flick.

But you may want to wait for this one to come on DVD and or catch it on Netflix for \"free\""}, {"rating": "5", "text": "If you think you can make another version of TWILIGHT (2008) just by combining two good-looking teen idols in one screen, figuring out whether thiz will work? You are completely messed up. Alex Pettyfer is John Smith, a mysterious boy who possesses extraterrestrial power in his hand. With his protector Henri (Timothy Olyphant), they look like father and son, but beneath it all they are aliens in human form, sought by a group of evil alien who are called Mogadorian. Meanwhile, in his escapee, Alex meets and falls in love with an ordinary and beautiful girl named Sarah (Played by Glee sensation, Dianna Agron). Initially, I thought it will be some kind of A Romance with Actions. Instead of that, it turns out to be Pure Action with a Romantic background. The chemistry between Alex and Sarah actually went pretty smoothly, but the proportion is too brief and not as intense as it should. The Director is D. J. Caruso who is well-known for DISTURBIA (2007) and EAGLE EYE (2008). After two or three scenes at the beginning, the movie atmosphere reminds me of one of those SMALVILLE TV series (2001-2011) which is including: the setting, the characters and the conflict. Most of the Action scenes are good enough to watch, though no further explanation about what is really happenning. I previously thought the Number Six character who is described as a sexy and energetic girl will be the scene stealer (played by my favorite rising star, Teresa Palmer). As a matter of fact, her character is too minor and there is the impression she is just a mere sweetener. At the end, the movie is closed by a situation which is opening a possibility of potential sequel. In summary, thiz is not a movie that you want to spend 100 minutes of your precious time. Unless, you are 16-year-old teen who are attracted to thiz kind of movie, then you should go to see it before your friends watch it first. For me, it is definitely not a number one.

When I saw the trailer for the film I honestly thought it would be good and in a way it was I suppose.

Through out the film there are constant action scenes with fights and explosions everywhere sometimes this can make a film shocking.

Henri(Timothy Olyphant), his guardian and surrogate parent(who is much more accesible than hologram projection of Marlon Brando's disembodied head), at every turn, encourages John to keep a low profile, and yet the father figure never broaches the s-word, the bane of the tan(and buff) alien's ability to disappear in plain sight. Worse than going blind, the unfounded threat made by Catholic priests to regulate morality since time immemorial, self-abuse, or rather, in this case, possessing impure thoughts about the opposite sex, as suggested by the incident on the Floridian beach at the outset of \"I Am Number Four\", have actual physical ramifications on the very instruments that pollute one's own, and the other's temple. Blue lights shoot out of John's hands, a twilight emission of electronic fluid, coaxed from the palms when the skinny dipper of a female persuasion gets closer to Four(aka John), the sexually excited alien. John's real father, as well as his mother, both killed back at the home planet on the day it exploded, would be better able to handle their son's growing pains than Henri, who reluctantly allows his charge to enroll in school without ever addressing the pitfalls of an intensely coed environment. Shirking off his parental duties back in the Sunshine State nearly undermined their efforts to elude detection from the Margorains(their gills suggest a race of sharks that are a thousand generations removed from their Earth-bound ancestors). The promotion of a celibate lifestyle catches up with the otherwise detail-oriented Henri, in which John, the unlikeliest of virgins, having been sheltered from matters concerning his body, looks panic-stricken when he lights up the ocean and night sky with his hormones, suggestive of, perhaps, the legacy's ill-preparedness in dealing with late-blooming puberty, similar to the titular character in Brian DePalma's \"Carrie\"(played by Sissy Spacek), who was never told about menstrual blood, much to the delight of her high school peers. \"I Am Number Four\", or rather, \"I Am the Superman Origin Story\", leaves the question about inter-species sex unanswered. In Richard Donner's \"Superman II\", the Man of Steel surrenders his otherworldly powers in order to explore the physical side of love with Lois Lane(Margot Kidder), because according to the Jor-el hologram, Superman(Christopher Reeve) has to be human before he can love like a man. John, on the other hand, thinks like a man, in which the alien's infatuation with Sarah(Dianna Argon) informs his confrontations with Mark(Jake Abel), Sarah's ex, who provokes the numbered humanoid into spilling more blue light, therefore compromising the desired anonymity that the Loriens covet. Towards the end, \"I Am the Superman Origin Story\" turns into \"I Am Six the Margorian Slayer\", when Four is joined by a duplicate Buffy(played by Teresa Palmer), in what, admittedly, turns out to be a rousing action-packed finale, highlighted by a shape-shifting beagle, against the backdrop of a Whedon-esque setting, a high school, where good and evil hash things out with a maximum of sound and fury. Choosing spectacle over story, \"I Am Number Four\", obviously cross-marketed for both sexes, leaves the girls(who loved \"Twilight\") behind by not exploring the potential hazards that may arise from spending one night of passion with a \"little green man\" from outer space."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I thoroughly enjoyed this film and so did all of the family!

WIth stylistic and plot elements taken from the Terminator series, Superman, War of the Worlds (amongst others, including Donnie Darko), there is a dark undercurrent to this movie which barely manages to be felt, but which you can certainly project into it if you want. Although I had hoped it might be a little more original it didn't really matter because of charismatic actors with enough humour in their way to see that they were skirting 'Scary Movie' territory even as they played it straight.  The lack of originality didn't matter for this reviewer.  The villains were horrible - the kind who you wouldn't want to meet out-and-about - yet they held a strange rockstar appeal in their long black coats.  The special effects were tremendous, and although there were almost no plot surprises for an older movie watcher, there were plenty of well-crafted moments to keep it alive.
