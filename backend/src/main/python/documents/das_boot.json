Claustrophobic, non stop action that literally had me cringing throughout the long (nearly 4 hours) journey. You get so absorbed into the movie, you get to know the characters so well. Great acting, filming, dialogue and music. A masterpiece. 10/10"

      "text": "This movie would have been awfully boring it wasn`t as scary as it is. The first time I watched it I had to take breaks because I couldn`t take the tension. The claustrophobia of this film is something really special. We sit in half- darkness most of the time anticipating hull sounds. The story is simple, though it`s just secondary to the main part and that is the Uboat. This tin coffin reminds us of everything we`d like never to experience in our lives. And yet there were real poeple volunteering to serve onboard of those coffins. Right to the end that history showed most of them were destroyed in action. For some reason the German actors really play it well. I mean this couldn`t have been done so good if they were average. Everything is believable here - the effects (as few of them as there are) are great, the submarine external views underwater are outright scary, the music perfectly goes with the atmosphere."

      "text": "Trois versions de Das Boot ont vu le jour : la courte, la longue (3 plombes et demi, moussaillon !) et l'extra-longue (5h mon gar\u00e7on !) parce que quand on aime, on ne compte pas, mon gars ! et toutes les 3 sont excellentes, prolongeant \u00e0 chaque fois un peu plus l'exp\u00e9rience de la vie des sardines dans leur bo\u00eete...Une exp\u00e9rience forc\u00e9ment claustrophobique \u00e0 l'un des (nombreux) moments-cl\u00e9s de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale, fin 1941 lorsque les loups silencieux ont mang\u00e9 leur pain blanc et deviennent des proies, les proies de la Marine britannique \u00e9quip\u00e9e du sonar. L'un des tournants de la guerre \u00e9videmment et une lutte d\u00e9sormais perdue d'avance pour les sous-marins de la Kriegsmarine...C'est bien s\u00fbr le film qui a fait conna\u00eetre Wolfgang Petersen dont la r\u00e9alisation pr\u00e9cise et pointue comme une horloge restitue \u00e0 merveille le calvaire des gars dans leur bo\u00eete de conserve. La tension et la peur, le sang-froid et l'espoir sont \u00e0 couper au couteau sur ces visages tendus, de m\u00eame que les moments fulgurants de l'attaque et de la fuite, ce jeu permanent du chat et de la souris.Le film a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 aussi J\u00fcrgen Prochnow en \u00e9tat de gr\u00e2ce ici qui campe un commandant \u00e0 la fois d\u00e9sabus\u00e9 et cynique, paternaliste et loyal jusqu'au bout... et d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment optimiste et opini\u00e2tre, un exemple et un phare pour ses hommes. Un vrai r\u00f4le de composition jusqu'\u00e0 la fin, une fin qui offre au film un d\u00e9nouement \u00e9tonnant de maturit\u00e9... et d'ironie.Car Das Boot n'est pas que dramatique et stressant, il est aussi parfois dr\u00f4le et toujours tr\u00e8s humain, plus vrai que nature et r\u00e9aliste jusqu'au bout des boulons. Bien s\u00fbr, les effets ont un peu vieilli pour une certaine partie d'entre eux (les maquettes...) mais au vu de son \u00e2ge, Das Boot fait encore le boulot. On s'interroge \u00e9galement sur la musique \u00e9lectronique de Klaus Doldinger mais on finit par y adh\u00e9rer \u00e0 notre insu, son th\u00e8me enquiquinant se montrant tr\u00e8s efficace.Il s'agit clairement d'un beau film de guerre dont la sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 est touchante, sans aucune gloriole de bas \u00e9tage, sans guimauve d\u00e9plac\u00e9e, sans effets de manches ou autre tour de passe-passe : c'est prenant, surprenant et d'un pacifisme intelligent."

      "text": "This interesting war film shows us a little of what was the daily life of a submarine crew during World War II. As the film is German, not surprisingly, is a German submarine. And tastes good to hear the dialogues in the original tongue, giving more authenticity tho the movie than the English, which most of films used indiscriminately, because of commercial interests.This film is, of all submarine movies, the best I've ever seen. The more realistic and closer to reality, without dramatic contrivances, without the flying imagination of those who have never seen a submarine but has to make a film about it. Its based on a book by Lothar G. Buchheim which, I believe, describes real events. The script reflected this effort, this search for reality. I do not know any of the actors, I am no expert in cinema, but I enjoyed the interpretation of J\u00fcrgen Prochnow, the captain, and Klaus Wennemann, who played chief engineer submarine. I will not be very surprised if someone says to me that some footage was shot in a real submarine... whole scenario was thought to detail and it shows how submarines are claustrophobic.Far from the American sensationalism, this European film makes a very interesting picture of a reality that most movies rather fantasize the extreme. It is a proof of how thin can sometimes be the line between documentary and a cinematographic work."

It is so accurate in its happenings, and doesn't hold anything back. It doesn't sugarcoat the filth or the fear that encompasses the ship. Petersen and company have crafted a fine film just short of a modern classic."

Poetry and Repugnance walk hand-in -hand here."

      "text": "I believe it has a good feel of authenticity due to all dialogues being in German and realistically portrayed what one would experience on a German submarine (as far as I could imagine).That's all the good aspects I found worth mentioning.Characters or \"The Drama\": Something that has been praised in the reviews before deciding to watch the movie - is pretty much non-existent. The characters lacked any introduction - except the usual hectic one in the beginning where you are bombarded with all of the characters' names . I could only name ONE member of the submarine by the end of the movie - in other words, ONE of all the characters. None of the characters has any personality except the usual team of; The emotional one, the posh one, the mentally questionable one, the missing home/relatives one and the decision-maker. The acting was both good and bad, it isn't short of intense death stares.Objective or \"The Adventure\": Where are they going, what's the objective or mission? Lacking the concept of where they are, which might be reflecting the sense of the crew and shifting more focus on the submarine, after all - they do have a navigator. This lack of a mission led to - unsurprisingly - that the action came to them. Later on, when they do set up destinations it's either; briefly mentioned and reached right away or it's described in detail and - of course - becomes difficult.Sound & Music: \"We can hear more down here, than we can see up there.\" Keeping the music to a minimum for specific moments only or reflecting the crew's emotions is a good aspect. But the movie could be more reliant on or more telling with sound than words. To explain that the approaching \"humming\" is a ship - after establishing that a ship is approaching isn't that.Story: This is apparently based on a novel... A fictitious narrative. Rushes through the last act like crossing it off the checklist, thus failing to make an impactful ending.My expected ending: The ship they thought was abandoned and once again shot at, was one of the most impactful scenes - of the few. Therefore, I expected them to take their roles later on in some way. And so comes the situation where they are stuck at the bottom and manages to resurface. At this time, I expected the engines to not work, receive fire and they would be left to surrender...Would they be treated like they treated the crew of the ship before - left to die?"

The atmosphere is great and the play with the sound is amazing. Classic"

But for me, an Engineer, I find really bad that the divisions in the gauges between \"Unit Order\" contain 6 divisions instead of the correct 5 as the divisions exist for easy reading in the days where digital displays/numbers didn't exist. It never was used not only in WW2 but never in any gauge in history since it doesn't allow accurate reading of an analog display! **** aside - great time spent seeing both the new and the old series (which I prefer the old one and I advise to see the series instead of the director's cut)"

Is The Empire Strikes Back?No, because Das Boot is.The tension, the danger, this is a slow burn movie with a feeling that everything on-screen is authentic to the hellish experience of being stuck on a U Boat in WWII. That's why I prefer it in German with subtitles (although the original German cast did the English dub so its pretty good). Watching in German adds to the authenticity.Sehrohrtiefe!!!"
