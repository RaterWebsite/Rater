      "text": "Centurion is a pretty decent action-packed historical thriller. The story may be merely diverting rather than compelling, but there's plenty to entertain throughout. The fight scenes are brutal and expertly handled, and I like the comparison made between Pict tactics and modern guerrilla warfare. The cast are all competent, but no-one gives a performance of any particular note, and the script is a little flat.  When compared to other films of this type, Centurion is far better than King Arthur (which had few redeemable qualities at all) but it's not quite in the same league as Gladiator (lacking as it does Ridley Scott's visual pinache and well-developed characters). Neil Marshall continues to prove himself as a talent to watch. While there's nothing majorly wrong with Centurion, it doesn't have enough to make it stand out from other releases - perhaps Marshall needs to return to doing something more daring again, like Dog Soldiers and The Descent."

Everything in this movie looks cheap: the fortress, the effects, everything. Combine that with a bad script, and you have a crap movie. The guy running around in the snow in the beginning was clearly wearing something that looked like Dockers pants, I am pretty sure they did not have those around in the second century. In addition, it should be clear by now that a British accent ruins every movie. It sounds retarded,  cannot explain why."

With a compelling and thrilling storytelling, in addition to Michael Fassbender's solid performance and director Neil Marshall's success in making use of visual effects, Centurion precisely depicts the realistic horror and brutality that faced Roman legionnaires in  their conquest of Britannia. I love history, i love the Romans, and, most importantly, I'm a great fan of Michael Fassbender, so I recommend this film with no hesitation at all."

Yes, it may recall Mad Max lost in Inverness, at times but it does get across with a sublime color palette by the photographer and a very savy delivery by the scarce dialogue and vast imagery. Dominic West and Michel Fassbender are on the dot, also exBond Girl, Kurylenko. Get off it, the Centurion theme is overdone, but it can be revisited."

      "text": "Centurion is a mixed bag, but there is far more good than bad. However, let's focus in on the bad. For one, it is far too violent. After a certain point, it becomes numbing and the CGI blood just becomes a major nuisance. You do not have to slit everyone's throat or show blood spurting from every wound for me to understand that war is bloody. Like, I got it. In addition, the character development is incredibly poor. Other than a few main characters, the names of these people really just slipped my mind immediately after I heard them. In war films, characters often remain largely anonymous due to a focus on action. Centurion is no different as I could not tell you who any of these people are. In saying this, however, there are many positives. For one, the film is breathtakingly gorgeous at times. The cinematography is stellar. The fight choreography is also brilliantly done, which goes hand-in-hand with the excellent action sequences. There are a good number of them, but they are all edge of your seat exciting and perfectly sequenced. The direction from Neil Marshall is not fantastic, but it gets the job done. The film feels coherent and is extremely well-paced, to the point that it feels shorter even with an already short run time. Finally, the acting from Michael Fassbender and Dominic West is great. Olga Kurylenko even does well with zero lines of dialogue. She did a great job capturing the terror instilled by her character even without uttering a single word. Overall, Centurion is a good action film that will be too violent for some, but if you can deal with that element of it, you are in for a surprise."

      "text": "the movie starts of nicely with a couple of great roman battles, but quickly dulls down to the cliche survival story where the party keeps shrinking with one men at a time until only the most important characters are left. When they finally do make it out of there endeavour they are greeted with even more hostility from there fellow romans. So instead of some sort of epic end revenge battle they flee into the woods. great beginning, okay middle part, dull ending."

      "text": "This film is based on the mysterious disappearance of IX Legio Hispana, one of the Roman legions. We know that it remained a long time in Britain but it's disappearance from the records without any mention has elicited several speculations. This is precisely what this film does, creating a story where it takes advantage of the best known hypothesis for this disappearance: the massacre of this legion in combat. Many classicists disagree with this theory and you can find enough specialized literature on the subject by the hand of the most notable historians, but the fact is that the story created for this film is plausible, which helps to create a pleasant sense of historical accuracy, with some understandable yields when dramatic effect or pragmatic issues prevailed. One of the things that caught my attention was the crystalline similarity between the battle represented in the film and the disastrous Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, where General Varo lost his life and his legions in the time of Augustus. It was, in fact, a good action sequence, with touches of realism that only sinned by the exaggeration, of fake blood used.The cast was very good. Michael Fassbender was very convincing in the role of a centurion, who survives the carnage and tries to return. Less happy was the idea of making each of the surviving soldiers come from a region of the empire. We have already seen this clich\u00e9 previously, I believe it was used in the 2004 movie \"King Arthur\" but I may be wrong (I'm speaking from my fallible memory). Anyway, the idea sounded false. Dominic West, Ulrich Thomsen and Imogen Poots also did a good job but it was the sweeping performance of Olga Kurylenko who dominated the film. She played an extremely cruel and malicious Pictish woman who decided to dedicate her life to avenge herself on the Romans. This barbarian killing machine was an intense enemy and contrasts with the humanity of Poots character, a woman with a past of pain, but kind and of whom we instinctively like.The production vallues and technical issues also seemed very good to me. In contrary to the current trend, the film virtually waived the green screen and filmed on location, which is a plus point. Action sequences and fights are good, realistic enough and only harmed, as I said, by exaggeration in false blood. It reminded me of the movie \"300\", where I criticized the emphasis on blood. Of course a battle needs blood but we cannot go into exaggerations, by excess or by defect. I really enjoyed the cinematography. She was able to convey the feel of the period as well as the intense cold that was felt. The color tones were excellent and the contrast adequate. The only negative note is the movie soundtrack. It fulfills its role but ends up being forgettable.To summarize, this film is very good and considerably better than other films (\"Braveheart\", \"King Arthur\" etc.) in the same style, but that ended up becoming more famous and having greater visibility. Historically realistic, it doesn't depict any historical fact but a theory, under discussion, so don't fully believe in the story the film tells, remember this is not a documentary. Entertaining, is a good movie for those who enjoy history and the Roman period, or simply for those who enjoy a good adventure or action film."

      "text": "This film inserts itself into a couple of historical gaps: first, what happened to the soldiers of the Ninth Legion; second, what were the Picts really like?  \"Centurion\" comes up with much more sinister answers than historians venture, but, hey, it's a movie, right?  Problem is, the film can't decide whether it wants to be a kind of anti-epic or a simple chase film.  As one who steps out for popcorn when a film \"cuts to the chase,\" I'm much more interested in the former, so I enjoyed those scenes in which the Romans betray the \"civilizing\" values they claimed to be taking to \"the barbarians.\"  Fight scenes, too, were pretty engaging, though I was a little surprised that the giant fireballs from \"Troy\" managed to roll all the way to the Scottish highlands.  Moreover, I genuinely didn't see the ending coming, which was a treat.  But the vast stretches of film in which pursuer followed pursued I found eye-rollingly dull, despite some novel characters and gorgeous scenery."

Mike Fassbender is far too good an actor to have been associated with this tired out nonsense depicting Roman-era war-lords with blood-thirsty svelte-supermodels who barely weigh 100lbs, but can put down battle hardened men twice their size --- yeah ---- sure ---- can you spell \"feminazi nonsense\" ?  -- Sure -- I knew you could. Notwithstanding the fact that women of that era who were not wives - were whores ---- the notion that any women participated in hand-to-hand combat in an official soldier capacity at that time in history - is poppycock.  I'm really getting sick and tired of the s****t coming out of hollywood nowadays.  There isn't a film produced today, that doesn't either involve a bunch of He-Women outsmarting and out-fighting men twice their size - or some sort of homosexual relationship that is pushed as being somehow superior to a heterosexual / traditional family arrangement.  Hollywood's surreptitious social engineering with their ridiculous propaganda is becoming tiresome - and there are plenty of disgruntled Americans who see right through it.

      "text": "Neil Marshall seems an odd choice for this type of movie . An established horror director isn't the first person you'd think of when choosing a director to make a historical adventure featuring ancient Rome in their battle to tame the Picts . That said he knows Scotland very well since his previous films DOG SOLDIERS and DOOMSDAY were both set there even if they were filmed in Luxumberg and South Africa respectively . At least the Scotland here resembles the gloomy bleak landscape seen in WinterFrom the outset Marshall shows his genre roots by making CENTURION as violent as possible . I saw this on the same day as I saw the last RAMBO movie and there's not a world of difference between the two movies where violence is concerned , people are decapitated and disemboweled and rivers run red with blood . If there's a problem it's as in his other films Marshall shows a slight problem with pacing . When characters sit down and talk you find yourself hoping for a bit more character interaction but this rug is pulled from under the audiences feet and we're back to a bloody set-piece regardless if it's needed or not . I had hoped for a little bit more conversation and a little bit less action please . If someone makes a bio-pic on Elvis then Neil Marshall will not be that director. That said films such as THE NAKED PREY and APOCALYPTO don't have much in the way of conversation eitherI'll say one thing in favour of the director and that is he's able to make a film where the British Isles have been invaded and the modern day British audience are still able to empathise with the invaders to an extent . Neither side is painted in black and white and the Romans are helped by the fact that they're played by a likable cast . One possibly might suggest that there's a subtext on Afghanistan going on here somewhere . By this I mean an all conquering super power finding itself unable to decisively beat an indigenous population . In fact the infamous line about Afghanistan being \" The grave yard of empires \" is almost spoken in relation to the PictsAnd that's perhaps the underlying fundamental problem with CENTURION . It's a film that could be somewhat more cerebral and character driven but has sacrificed this in order to be a violent historical action adventure that doesn't let up . It's a good film but perhaps should have been an even better one regardless of the budget"
