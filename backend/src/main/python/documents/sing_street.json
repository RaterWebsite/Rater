He meets a girl a bit older than himself and trying to impress her, asks if she would like to be in a video with his band.

A movie  for the modern romantic that will definitively make those shine that are dreaming of something better. A rare find,"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Writer/director John Carney has previously helmed 2 films about musicians and their creative process (\"Once\" & \"Begin Again\"). This one revolves around a young teen in 80s Dublin who forms a band to impress a girl. The resulting group of misfits is cute in their awkward innocence, while the period style and music pervade the film's atmosphere. The band performs a number of original songs (by Carney) that prove to be catchy pop fun. In addition to the musical treats, it's a truly sweet story of a young man's efforts to express himself and his love. Sure, you can bask in the nostalgia of MTV's early days, but you'll also find yourself charmed by the film's buoyant youthful optimism."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A thoroughly delightful viewing experience, Sing Street is a sweet, melodic, and truly charming film. Flush to the brim with truly fantastic music that sweeps you up in its essence, Sing Street is the definition of movie magic. Its plot and characters can be quite cliche, but the magic and feeling it gives you is anything but. Instead, Sing Street's typical plot is anything but a problem, instead it simply serves as the foundation for a film that will make you fall in love with watching the film and the characters. The characters are also very well-written, multi-dimensional human beings facing real problems (divorce namely). The film's approach to their real problems is most certainly incredibly relatable and hits home. Aside from the music, the comedy in the film is also quite strong with many lines causing me to actually laugh out loud, which is a rarity nowadays. Overall, Sing Street is a charmer that really sweeps you up in its magic and should please crowds of all ages."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Back to the 80s with rock and roll and romance.\r I seriously thought this might be an overrated film. I knew it was too early to judge it, so I was not expecting anything extraordinary and then it struck me with its progress, I was clean bowled by its style and cuteness. I don't what others think, but this is John Carney's masterpiece according to me. I liked his other films, but this is something I think a perfect dose of contents. In two words to say it is a Golden Touch. I rarely like music and musical films, and it had been long since one I had enjoyed very much like this. Definitely this should be one of the top ten films of the years.\r This is an Irish-British film that is set in the Dublin, 1985. It is about a high school boy named Conor, who just got transferred from a private school to a free state-run boy's school after his parents imposed a plan on the budget cut. New school and problems are ahead where he has to come out of it on his own. During getting used to it, he meets a girl who lives nearby the school and to impress her, he lies that he has a band and looking for a female singer. So then he forms one with the amateur musicians and the journey begins for these teenagers that reveals in the remaining film how long they are willing to go.\r \"Your problem is that you're not happy being sad. But that's what love is, Cosmo. Happy-sad.\"\r At the end of the final scene, there is a note that says 'For brothers everywhere'. I was impressed by that, because I did not pay attention on that while watching the film. What I meant was, this is not some teenage love story, actually it was about the brothers, but overshadowed by romance theme. I recalled my memories on those parts and quickly realised the centre of the story that how it was developed. The one who played the older brother of Conor simply looked alike Seth Rogan and that is the character you have to watch out for. He's only a supporting character, but the impact was indirectly larger on the story.\r Of course, falling in love might make you do crazy things, even you can become a rockstar overnight. But there's a first step for everything and it is not assured that you will be succeed by those attempts. That is where comes the experienced hand, the brother, a close friend who stood by us since our birth. It is easy to fall in love, but it is not easy to have a brother who guides us in every move on that.\r In this film the sreenspace between them was very little, but that did not stop to disclose how one's inspiration that got from love to mold accurate shape and to lead the right path. I don't have any brother, but I felt how it would be to have one. So all the brothers in the world must see it, this is dedicated to them.\r \"It's like when you don't know someone, they are more interesting. They can be anything you want them to be. But when you know them, there's limits to them.\"\r I did not grow up in the 80s, but was very close to it and I know how it would feel to be born in that generation. Jeans, thick hair and curls, everybody was so thin, weird make-ups with strong eyeliner, big eyeglasses, cassettes, you would love this film if you remember those stuffs from your fading memories.\r A very stylish music-comedy and on the romance side, this film was very cute. All the actors were brilliant, especially the lead boy whose first film was this and the girl amazing with her totally electrifying look. They both going have a great future in filmdom. Not to miss out the supporting cast who did their part so well, especially the brother I talked about in the other paragraph.\r All the sound tracks were awesome. I should start adding them to my 'film songs' collection, especially 'The Riddle of the Model' which defines this title and the film's climax song 'Go Now'. So from the cast to crew, equal credits must given to the music composers and lyricists from the real 80s bands. The film had a perfect runtime, I would have had no issue if it was extended for another half an hour.\r The pace of the narration always kept in a same position, but towards the final quarter it has gone up. Yes, I loved the ending, it was touching, but I don't know how to describe it, only one can experience it by himself. A film I watched without any anticipation, now it is one of my favourite films. Todays generation might take it as another rock and roll inspired theme, but only the middle aged guys and some old ones would know how to enjoy it. So don't miss it out if you are one of them.\r 8.5/10"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A charming, funny, coming of age period piece about a hopeless romantic teen who discovers talents he never knew he had as he woos the object of his desire.

The film also deftly spoofs the early days of music videos, mimicking their unapologetic silliness but without going over the top in doing so.

So, you\u2019re not only starting to see this main character evolve in terms of understanding how music works thanks to the wisdom of his older brother, who is a fantastic character who gets just the right amount of screen time by the way. The side characters just seem there to fill in the shoes of the Sing Street band, and I wished we got to see more of them, as the story really primarily focused on the main character Connor and his want-to be girlfriend Raphina. The story moves along very well, every scene with Connor is entertaining, especially in the sense that the nostalgia in the film for people born in the 80\u2019s gives people a sense of familiarity with the character \u2013 so when you see him succeed him in his aspirations, and see what it took to get there, it makes the film very satisfying, really adding to the feel good factor.

On the lead it stars Lucy Boynton, Maria Doyle Kennedy, Jack Reynor, Kelly Thornton and Ferdia Walsh-Peelo.\rThis movie is about a boy who lives with his two parents that are seemingly on the verge of breaking up, and they move him to a free state-school. There he falls for a girl who then he decides to create a band to impress her.\rThis movie is much deeper than that, and I think it benefits from it a lot because this is one of the best films I have seen in a very long time. The acting is phenomenal from every single actor here, starting with Ferdia Walsh-Peelo on the lead as Conor Lalor who gives genuinely one of the best male performances of the year. Ferdia Walsh-Peelo as Raphina, the girl who Conor falls for, is also amazing. But who totally stood out to me was Conor's brother in the movie, Brendan portrayed by Jack Reynor. I can not believe that this is the same guy who was in Transformers: Age of Extinction. I remembered him instantly from that monstrosity but with every second passing with him on screen I was more and more impressed.\rThe writer-director John Carney does a wonderful job here, from the camerawork to the incredible soundtrack that just stays with you long after you've seen this masterpiece. The life lessons are perfectly conveyed to the audience and the \"kid\" in all of us. I am certainly not what would be considered as an 80's kid and I might have not got all the references but that did not stop me from enjoying the movie so much.

Then his parents call a family meeting and they tell Conor and his two siblings they are cutting back on spending money and as a result Conor will go to private school; which in America would be more expensive. Anyway, Conor goes to private school and the priest/principal is like a huge d***. Later that day Conor watches MTV with his brother and it is revealed they share a bond over music. His brother explains to Conor how revolutionary Duran Duran is, and at that point you know what you've signed up for in the movie department. Conor meets a short redhead kid who is nearly impossible to understand, and he introduces Conor to a singer songwriter named Eamon who wants to start a band. They form a Lennon/McCartney bond faster than any musicians in the history of music and start a band with three other people who contribute very little to the movie. That's when Conor meets a beautiful young girl named Raphina whom he wants to impress and sweep off her feet. He tells Raphina he's in a band and he's looking for a girl to be in a music video their shooting. She tells him she doesn't like boys, or some cryptic bulls*** that a 16 year old girl would say to get attention. She says she'll be in his music video if she \"has time.\" You've got time you attention grubbing teen. Then Conor and Eamon write an amazing first song called The Riddle of the Model. Like if this was the first song I had ever written I would be so goddamn excited. He brings over a cassette tape to Raphina and she enjoys the song so much she agrees to be in his music video. After they shoot the video Raphina reveals she has a boyfriend, but she still wants Conor to give her a lot of attention so she agrees to be in more of his videos. Conor is convinced if he writes a good enough song, Raphina will be his forever. He then continues to write unbelievably great songs for an angsty 15-year-old Irish boy, but Raphina continues to show little desire to be with him. Then in school he is confronted by the priest/principle about his angsty behavior, and he is told to wash the makeup off of his face. Conor refuses, and the priest grabs him and takes him into the bathroom, and there is a brief moment where you totally think he is going to sexually assault Conor, but he only nearly drowns him in the sink. Conor leaves school upset, but Raphina is outside waiting for him to acknowledge her, then as if she couldn't get any more annoying she starts calling him \"Cosmo\" for no reason. Conor writes his best song yet and invites Raphina to shoot the music video, she says she'll be there. The day comes and surprise, surprise Raphina bails. Where did she go? She moved to London with her boyfriend so she could try to be a model. Conor is completely broken up by this. In addition to Raphina abandoning him, his parents have decided to get divorced because his mother has been cheating on his father. Time goes by and he has not only written more songs for his band, but successfully landed a gig to play prom. Right before they play prom Conor walks by Raphina's house, only to find she is still living there. London did not work out for her, and her loser boyfriend shockingly abandoned her. Conor gives her one last tape and storms off. Raphina listens to the tape, has a moody walk through the park, and \"realizes\" Conor is the one for her. Conor nails his gig with his band, and Raphina shows up right at the end. Conor has decided to sail away to London with Raphina and abandon his band after writing half of what could be a number 1 album. He hugs them goodbye, runs through the streets with Raphina, then gets home and asks his brother to drive them to the pier. His brother agrees, and Conor goes into his parents' room to steal his father's boat keys. He grabs the keys, looks at his father sleeping on the floor while his harlot mother takes the entire bed. He then says \"I love you Mom,\" and walks out the door. \"Thanks for breaking up the family homewrecker, I love you. And I won't even say goodbye to Dad at all, I'll just steal his boat keys and flip him two fingers while I shout 'deuces'.\" The movie ends with Conor and Raphina sailing off into the ocean, assuming they will make it to Wales on however little gas they have, literally shoving the 'coming of age' genre down our throats in one foul swoop. Before the credits role, the screen says, \"Dedicated to Brothers Everywhere.\" HOW WAS THIS MOVIE ABOUT BROTHERS?!

My favorite of 2016. I wish I'd seen it on theaters but it didn't even get a release date in my country. I definetely recommend this to anyone even if you're not into musicals. Strictly speaking, this isn't a musical, it's a coming of age movie that features music. The characters are great and the story is compelling that after watching it your day is gonna get brighter and you'll leave with a smile on your face."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Sing Street is the definition of feel good and such an entertaining experience for me. Set it the 80s, Sing Street has this charm whether it's in its story telling or characters that makes it easily one of the best films of 2016. Anyone can enjoy this movie for its light hearted story of youth and love. Carney's vision is fantastic and I loved every second of this film. A Must See!"}], "recommendations": ["in_the_heights", "sing", "mamma_mia_here_we_go_again", "vivo", "grease", "mary_poppins", "the_greatest_showman", "rocketman", "burlesque", "yesterday", "almost_famous", "high_school_musical_3_senior_year", "trolls", "la_la_land", "jingle_jangle_a_christmas_journey", "cats", "begin_again", "hairspray", "into_the_woods", "mamma_mia", "strange_magic", "one_direction_this_is_us", "my_little_pony_equestria_girls_rainbow_rocks", "me_and_earl_and_the_dying_girl", "trolls_world_tour"]}
