Expertly directed by Micheal Mann, Heat features knockout performances from both Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino.

Heat fires on all cylinders at all times and is quite simply one of the best movies ever made."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Quite simply a modern classic. I honestly think that in years to come this film will be regarded as a masterpiece of its genre (if that isn't already the case).

Pacino and de Niro are just perfect for the characters they play, the direction is equally strong. The length of the movie might be a bit too long for the usual Hollywood flick, but this is serious, heady stuff. Pacino is quintessential and meticulous as the cop who knows a challenge when he sees one, de Niro is the smooth operator who must always stay a step ahead. The leader of a fearsome crew, de Niro's silent, tough control over his team, over their future, is just perfect. The supporting cast are equally commendable. Of Michael Mann's best movies, Heat is certainly one of them. Cliched? Not one bit. The best scene of the movie isn't just the diner-coffee scene, it's the first one where de Niro ascends the electric stairs and on to the pavement. You see the look, the fierceness in his face, the way he walks and does his business, the perfect character played by the perfect actor. Pacino is no less powerful, the way he hankers after his informant, Eddy, the way he gets the 'slick' lead from Eddy's cousin, the way he prowls and stalks de Niro's crew, his tireless dedication to his work - Mann has just handled both these magnificent actors as well as any director has ever done so, with balance and precision. Pacino and de Niro are subdued in their fierceness, no over-the-top overacting by these two fine actors, it's just classic, downright methodical acting. The story builds up, adds more intrigue and suspense by the minute....Heat is one for the ages. I should say it, I've seen it no fewer than 15 times, from start to end!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Definitely one of the most epic crime films. Fantastic acting, good story and some epic action. It manages to keep your attention throughout despite being a long film. It's suspenseful, deep and eventful. The characters are well-developed, and there's a perfect balance between action and story. At first there seems to be two unrelated movies in one going on at the same time, but the way it comes together, and especially the moment when the two main characters meet makes for a great scene. Overall, Heat is not a shallow action film, but isn't hard to follow or boring to watch. There aren't any points where you feel the time is wasted. Every minute of the film is put to good use and offers variety, rather than focusing purely on action or purely on developing the backstory for the characters. Al Pacino and Robert De Niro did a tremendous job in this film, and made it a must-watch."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Favorite 1990s film, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino were awesome together!

While clocking in at a nearly three-hour running time, there isn't a single wasted scene, it is always entertaining and I think it is very rewatchable too.

The story is plausible and beautifully structured with a breathtaking sequence towards the middle of the film, and there are a lot of memorable quotes. Heat is also brilliantly directed by Michael Mann and the acting of Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino is exemplary.

Michael Maan's poetic, sprawling crime epic can't be summed up in mere words -- it's literally got everything, from textured characters to plot twists to a dynamite score to first rate performances from a golden cast. This movie is what all movies should aspire to be."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Having seen almost every classic and influential crime drama of the past 30 years, I finally got around to seeing Heat. Having heard about how influential it has been in other movies and video games, I couldn't believe that I had waited so long to see this movie. Boy, was I disappointed. This movie is far from the masterpiece that I was led to believe. Other than a couple of great crime scenes (and a little bit of great action), I can't think of much that this film had that would make me want to see it again.While I wouldn't characterize the acting as bad, I can't think of anyone in this movie who gave a performance that is among their better ones. Al Pacino is practically a caricature of himself the entire time. He overacts in every scene and he yells about half of his lines. Robert Deniro has the same scowl on his face and speaks in pretty much the same voice for the whole movie. Pacino and Deniro fans looking for some \"tough guy\" porn will find plenty of it here.Ultimately, Heat is a movie that could have been made better by cutting about half the content. It is loaded with characters that are poorly developed, but are dramatically presented as if you are supposed to give a crap about any of them. One of them gets killed after about four minutes of screen time, and after that, we see his grieving wife. Rather than cry with her, I just kind of rolled my eyes. Another gang members death is presented with the drama akin to a squad mate getting killed in a war movie. I could have cared less. Val Kilmer's subplot centers around the tenuous relationship that he has with his wife. Al Pacino has a lousy third marriage and Robert Deniro somehow manages to have a romance side plot that is neither relevant nor believable.There is even a suicide attempt scene that has nothing whatsoever to do with the story \u2013 a diversion that will have you scratching your head, wondering why so much celluloid was wasted on it. Without exception, every single scene with a female in it could have been left on the cutting room floor, and not one shred of value would have been lost. None of the characters are sympathetic or well developed enough for you to want to see their romances work or to be able to share their pain. It would have worked well maybe in a television series where you would have more time to develop the characters, but here, all of the side plot material is really boring.One of the draws of this movie seems to be that it is a \"realistic\" and non ideal take on human behavior. Okay, I get that, but if you are going to go with the \"realistic\" approach, then don't ruin it with the occasional unbelievable scene or plot hole. The biggest offender is the famous bank robbery scene in the middle of the movie. It would have been spectacular in an action movie that didn't take itself seriously. But in Heat, I couldn't stop thinking about how absurd it was that a few guys with automatic weapons were able to cut through the entire LAPD like a hot knife through butter, escaping clean in the process. I still greatly enjoyed that scene, largely because it's just a great action scene that is well choreographed and shot. However, it's sort of out of place in this film.I'll give Heat some credit for not being a by-the-numbers cops and robbers movie. Maybe it is this uniqueness and the time of its release that made it so popular. Upon reflection though, there have been many crime and caper movies over the past few decades that are more entertaining than this one. Scarface, Reservoir Dogs, The Usual Suspects, to name but a few. While I didn't hate this movie, I certainly don't think that it deserves a place in the Top 10 greatest crime dramas."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Two of the most talented actors in the history of film in a head to head fight with each other. That's basically what your going to expect from \"Heat\". However underneath it is so much more, these are deep and intelligent characters who struggle with society and it's definitions of morality. At the end you will care for both Pacino (The Cop) and DeNiro (The Robber) as they have a lot of smart things to teach us about human nature and people in general. This is all thanks to fantastic dialogue and acting. Absolutely worth seeing, one of my favourites from 1995"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I can understand if this isn't your type of movie.  But to give it a negative review, let alone a zero -- that just shows you have absolutely no clue about films or cinema.  Yes, there are some \"cliches\", but what do you expect from a cop/robber film?  They weren't trying to reinvent crime here, they were trying to show the lives of a highly proficient crime ring and an obsessed FBI agent, and the people in their circles that their actions affect.  And the movie does an outstanding job of this.  This is not a pure action film by any stretch, yet it has some excellent action scenes.  If you're looking for fast-paced, high-action, over-utilized CGI, there are plenty of crappy films out there to satisfy you.  This is more of a slowly unfolding drama with actual character development and meaningful underlying story-lines (an art lost in present-day action films).

Michael Mann brings with him his own visual style: extended long shots, mostly at night often at desolate places that isolate the characters. The movie starts with such a shot: the camera is set in between the elevated tracks of a metro railway and centered on a station silhouetted against the early dawn sky. The lights in the shot define what we see. A metro moves into view from the right and stops at the station. The next shot shows de Niro stepping out. We hear nothing but the music playing and the sounds of the metro and the city. An awesome shot.\r The movie is carried by the acting and the visual style, but hampered by the weak and overburdened plot.   No less than three relations are followed as side stories, which allows some roles for women, albeit in the overcrowded niche of troubled partnerships. Mann is not one for strong independent women or ones that stand by their men.. Despite all the women(or maybe because of this), this is a man's movie foremost. No pun intended.\r The weakness of Heat is that Mann cannot quite make the plot stick. At the beginning, we start out with de Niro and his men robbing an armored money car with such gratuitous violence that it must have attracted crowds of onlookers as they are in the middle of LA, yet only one hobo was a witness to the events. This then is the reason that further on into the movie Pacino forestalls an arrest : they got nothing on them.  Another event that is badly handled is when the gang is caught robbing a bank. Again overdone violence results(another Mann trademark) whereby the three crooks fight off a police force that out guns and out man's them. They not only manage to take out seven policemen but get away with the loss of one of them and one wounded. All thanks to their never ending supply of bullets.\r Mann can not turn violence into something that does not hamper the plot. Shoot up half the town and nobody can point a finger. So, in the end, some ratting needs to be done, by a woman of course. But again: what evidence do they have that they did not have before? Nothing actually. So we just kill them all. With that the movie is actually about the morally bankrupt, perhaps another Mann trademark.\r Women do get the short end of the stick. They are a source of trouble: if they aren't nagging they are cheating and if they aren't cheating they are selling out their partners. And if they do neither of those they are best at whoring, lying or cowering in fear. The message: women, you can't do without them, just don't expect much too of them. And maybe that is another trademark of Mann.\r Short: it just takes too long and overreaches itself. Collateral is a lot better."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "One of the most intelligent and exciting crime movies I have ever seen. Possibly even better than The Godfather, the movie franchise which bought Al Pacino and Robert De Niro together for the first time. One of the main differences this time is that they are playing enemies, and they do it very well. I found the scene, just before the hugely famous bank robbery sequence, where Pacino and De Niro are explaining their intentions to each other over coffee to be ridiculously tense. So tense that I was almost feeling uncomfortable! Val Kilmer and Natalie Portman (in one of her earliest roles) are brilliant as part of the supporting cast too. It's a shame Michael Mann didn't direct anymore movies like this because Heat is to be blunt the only memorable work he has ever done.

HEAT has a rather great story about a cops obsession with catching a criminal named Neil McCauley and this maybe not the exact story but it pretty much sums it up. Vincent Hannah (Al Pacino) and his platoon of cop buddies are on the lookout to catch Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) in the act and wait for the right time to pounce on Neil McCauley (De Niro) and his criminal gang or crew who take scores and basically break the law.. The other criminals working with Neil McCauley are Chris (Val Kilmer),  Michael(Tom Sizemore) and Trejo played by Danny Trejo... Jon Voight is a villain also as he gets involved with De Niro if only by discussion.. So Robert De Niro and his crew do armed robberies and take scores and Vincent Hannah who's played by Al Pacino and who's an LAPD cop tends to stop him and his crew. Neil McCauley (De Niro) is still trying to track down someone who did a job for him but escaped De Niro and his criminal gang one mysterious night and hasn't been seen since and has kept a low profile. The escaped man in question is Waingro played by Kevin Gage but after one of the gang is close to death and criminal mastermind Neil McCauley (De Niro) finds him and hears Waingro is involved and some dude named Van Zant then De Niro tacks Waingro down and unloads a couple of bullets in him. When he leaves the building it's swarmed with innocents pouring out of the building and LAPD Lt. Vincent Hannah (Pacino) waiting for him so then belongs a footchase and bullets going off...
