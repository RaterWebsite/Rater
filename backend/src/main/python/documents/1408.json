Honestly, in a world where horror movies are much better than they are now, I may not like this movie very much, but with all the crap we have to sit through, I actually enjoyed have a film really creep me out. I though the shining was mindnumbingly boring when I first watched it. I read the book and LOVED it, so I assumed the movie would be the classic it was hailed as. Turns out it was just a kid riding a trike for half an hour and some goofy close ups of shelly Duvall and Jack Nicklson. The reason I tried this movie was actually BECAUSE of the PG-13 rating; I figured if the producers felt confident releasing a horror film that wasn't an R than they must have something good. Turns out this movie is one of the best psychological thrillers I have ever seen. It was both intelligent as well relatable, without trying to hard to have a moral theme. The movie just IS scary, playing of your emotions and inner most fears, and not the visceral ones either, your REAL fears, even the ones you may not have realized you had. Of course it's not perfect, and it drags in a few spots, But the plot twists and writing (plus Cusak's performance) make for a GENUINELY scary film. I can understand why some might think the movie was a little haphazard or not fully realized (I never read the short story, so I can't comment on that), but if you don't like it because it's not a gore fest than grow an imagination and step outside your little world of superviolence for something that ACTUALLY has substance."

This movie is creepy, and it sticks with you. this movie maked you believe the room is in fact alive. and you feel confined. i loved it, start to finish. The only complaint is that it slows down, and you think its over, which is a smart idea, but it slowed down, then it picked back up but not with the creepiness, the drama. Great Film. Mary McCormick was hot in it. Tony Shaloub was great, that's TWO great TV actors. John Cusack, as usual, is great. Samuel L Jackson, great. Check this out"

This film did not bore me, not even for a second. I kept wondering all the time what is going to happen next. John Cusack's performance was over the top and really intense as supported by Samuel L. Jackson and this film would be nothing if John was not in it. The unusual scares didn't scare me that well but I admire the different style of psychological horror and mystery the director, Mikael H\u00e5fstrom, adopted in making this film."

John Cusack turns in a great performance, as does Samuel L. Jackson in this well-crafted film that really has a lot more going on beneath the surface than you would anticipate from a film of this type. The horror is never cheap and the psychological element really does mess with you and scare you pretty thoroughly at times. However, this film truly rides on atmosphere and its well-adapted script with a seriously spooky air to the film and well made characters. As a whole, 1408 lived up to my expectations and managed to exceed them, but really delivered a thought-provoking look at many different elements that make the film worthy of a closer look."

      "text": "I watch horror movies when there's nothing better to watch. So I guess you could say its relatively consistent. But more often than any other genre, I'm disappointed by horror films. 1408 provides something different. it has a very solid lead actor, John Cusack, at the helm, and Stephen King's overall vision. Its a remarkably simple story but with the right tweaks it became its own monster. Like if you had your own personal horrors locked away in your head, room 1408 would slowly and sadistically put you to death with them. Its heavily weighted on one character's personal struggles. Which is gutsy in a lot of ways but it was well done. This wasn't a jittery, jumpy, bloody, or even crazy type of scary, this was a sad hollow and empty type of scary that we hope we will never have to experience. Though a few of those scenes get pretty trippy.  You don't make a movie this well delivered too often. It stands as one of my all-time favorites in the horror category."

      "text": "A typical PG-13 horror movie consists of a bunch of dumb teenagers aimlessly running around in their film either trying (and failing) to solve some urban myth or being killed off in the least inventive ways possible. Of course you get the rare Insidious or The Ring, but for the most part, you'll end up with a movie like Ouija or One Missed Call. 1408, however, is the former. Based on Stephen King's creepy short story, 1408 is about an author named Mike Enslin (because it's not a King story if there's no author involved) who writes about haunted houses, graveyards, and the likes. He gets a mysterious letter in his mail one day that tells him \"not to go to room 1408 in the Dolphin Hotel\". Viewing this as a challenge, Enslin, who's played flawlessly by John Cusack, finds this hotel and gains access to the forbidden room 1408.\r The horror begins before Enslin even steps into the room. As he's pacing the halls of the 14th floor, he finds himself back at an empty open elevator, as if the hotel is telling Enslin not to go into the room. Slightly confused, he finds 1408 and walks inside. Mike's first five minutes in the room is rather boring. Nothing particularly supernatural happens until his clock all of the sudden starts playing \"We've Only Just Begun\", and a 60 minute timer begins counting down, in response to the hotel manager who says that no one has ever lasted more than an hour in the room. The movie then becomes an increasingly terrifying, non-stop haunted house (or, in this case, haunted hotel room) ride that relentlessly scares the audiences with a growing sense of dread and a very heavy atmosphere. 1408 doesn't scare us with what does pop out; it scares us with what might pop out. If you've ever seen Oculus, this movie is similar to that, only in a hotel room.\r Being based on a very short story, the structure of this movie is extremely simple. 1408 is a one-man show, and John Cusack is the star. For three-quarters of the movie, it's just him in the room witnessing all these bizarre and scary events. This movie isn't cluttered with unnecessary backstories, side-characters, or plot twists. It's a simple and effective horror movie that leaves a lingering sting. 1408 may not be as ground-breaking as Carrie or The Shining, but this movie is definitely one of the best Stephen King adaptations to date."

So much is wonderful, including Cusack's droll awareness of playing the same, weary, cynical dude. The settings, the silences, the pacing - all grand, really. What goes wrong? TOO MUCH EXPOSITION, and the misleading kind. Based on the first 30 minutes, 1408 is beyond deadly. It's sadistic, vile, and very, very fast, given the self-mutilations which have occurred within it, and in mere minutes. But Cusack's experience, a few harmless phantoms aside, isn't terrifying; it's all about sadness and his personal despair. I expect more from a room that induces a maid to stab her eyes out in mere seconds.But - hey, it's all right. And the hotel window/ledge scenes are bloody fabulous."

Notice something about the numbers? If you add them together they equal 13, and there's your fun fact of the day. Despite what you see on the cover, Samuel L. Jackson only plays a minor role in the film, so you won't see him cussing like no tomorrow. Instead, he gives cryptic advice to the main character at the beginning of the movie, warning him not to go into the room. He goes so far to give him money and an expensive bottle of alcohol, which is taken but he still goes to the room. From there on, the movie turns into a twisting hallway with a surprise at every corner. Various frights ensue and soon the main character is struggling to try and get out of the room. By the time he finally does, you'll be on the edge of your seat. And then there's the twist ending, which pulls away to ANOTHER ending, revealing the guy's new partial insanity. If you enjoy horror films or are looking for more frights, 1408 is for you."

It's long, and at times, not easy to sit through, but if you're a fan of Stephen King, you should be used to that. This is vintage King and it's done right! When people don't like the movie, right away they go after the writer. They don't realize that a lot of times things are drastically changed to make them more visually appealing. In a horror flick, that's usually means  and/or gore, which are out of place in a King story. 1408 has none of that, it's just a good old fashion horror story about a room that possesses it's residence. The acting isn't going to blow you away, there aren't very many surprises as far as the story goes, but it's a scary story, done the way the master of horror intended and I liked it!"

More remarkably, perhaps, \u201c1408\u201d refuses to embrace the fashionable elements of torture porn, a la \u201cHostel: Part II,\u201d that are currently cutting a bloody swath through the horror genre, relying largely on psychological terror to impart the sense of someone possibly going mad, and taking the viewer along.\r In Stephen King\u2019s merrily warped world, the most damning thing a character can do is ignore the supernatural writing on the wall. As seen in novels like \u201cThe Shining\u201d or short stories like \u201cThe Road Virus Heads North,\u201d a character who displays hubris or cynicism, or simply fails to acknowledge life\u2019s mysteries, usually consigns himself to the author\u2019s pile of victims.\r Mike Enslin (Cusack), therefore, is the perfect foil for King the moral instructor: A successful writer of popular books about haunted houses and possessed graveyards, Mike scoffs at anything remotely paranormal, but, having lost a daughter to illness, he doesn\u2019t quite believe in anything else, either. Cusack\u2019s charmingly iconoclastic persona helps set Mike up for a lesson in metaphysical manners. By the end of \u201c1408,\u201d he will definitely believe in something.\r The Dolphin (which, coincidentally or not, is also the name of a haunted hotel in the Haruki Murakami novel \u201cDance Dance Dance\u201d) is a luxury establishment on Manhattan\u2019s East Side, a first-rate joint save for one room. Determined to debunk the mystery of room 1408, Mike has to threaten a lawsuit to gain access to the room, where he knows four people have met unlikely ends. What he doesn\u2019t know is that 50-odd people have actually died there, some of apparently natural causes, although the room also once drove a maid to gouge out her eyes. The official diagnosis? It\u2019s an evil room, says Dolphin manager Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson).\r But Mike is undeterred and, once he gets in, finds the room has bizarre shape-shifting properties. While Hafstrom eventually turns 1408 into a frozen tomb that cracks and shifts like an arctic ice shelf, it\u2019s in the smaller details that the creepiness escalates: The closeup of the old-fashioned lock mechanism as Mike inserts the key \u2014 the room itself having refused any security improvements \u2014 is a little gem of tension-building.\r Cusack, given plenty of room to ruminate about his plight and the state of his accommodations, is funny, tragic and moving \u2014 as if things weren\u2019t bad enough, his dead daughter Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony) pays him a visit, while his estranged wife Lily (Mary McCormack) tries to help him via a computer screen that\u2019s been taken over by the resident incubus. Make that inn-cubus. \u201c1408\u201d is a creepshow that delivers, although viewers may have second thoughts about ordering room service.\r Production values, spearheaded by Benoit Delhomme\u2019s excellent cinematography, are indispensable in this tale of illusion and delusion."

He didn't believe in ghosts...we got it...and within the first five minutes of the motion picture (even before he entered the Dolphin Hotel's doors). Speaking of early in the movie, I'm not sure why the woman, Anna, (in the book store after Enslin's \"Author's Corner\") was even there. Her entire scene consisted of her having Mike autograph one of his early books, \"The Long Road Home,\" that she purchased on eBay, and then asking him a question regarding the authenticity of the \"father/son\" relationship within. While the question was interesting, it was totally out of left field, and in no way pertained to the rest of the movie. I don't know if this \"side road\" of his relationship with his dad ended up on the film editor's floor, or if it was something that only those who read the short-story would understand. Despite Samuel L. Jackson only having a minimal role in the movie, his depiction of Gerald Olin was memorable. He took control as the Dolphin Hotel manager, without trying to take control of the movie. His disappointment in Mike Enslin's refusal to stay in a different room...ANY different room was both believable and sincere. His self-serving, uncaring line, \"Look, I'm not telling you not to stay in that room for your own good or for the profit of the hotel. Frankly, selfishly, I just don't want to clean up the mess,\" was short, sweet, and brutally honest. My favorite quote of the movie was actually from Jackson, in his limited role; it was when he answered Cusack's question of what was wrong with room 1408 by saying: \"It's an evil **** room.\"; it was classic Samuel L. Jackson, and reminiscent of his role in \"Pulp Fiction.\"Overall, I really enjoyed this movie; it was surprisingly scary for a PG-13 production. I read that there were actually four endings; while two of the other three were decidedly darker, the fourth was fluffy, fun, with a fantastic finality...which is something you neither expect nor desire from a Stephen King book/movie. So with that being said, I believe the one that made it into the theater production was the best of the lot. Despite the few negative reviews I've read here, I'm still going to recommend it. I believe some of the negativity comes from the fact that not only did this \"only\" garner a PG-13 rating (which is not of the norm from a Stephen King book-to-movie), but it doesn't \"feel\" like a King flick...neither of which is a bad thing. Despite those two reasons, it's still a better alternative to many non-Steven King, R-rated movies in the horror genre. To put it in another way: Stephen King + John Cusack + a little of Samuel L. Jackson sprinkled in = a pretty good way to spend a little under two hours of your time...STAY SCARED!"

However, it's not the script (by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski) that deserves most of the credit. Director Mikael Hafstrom \"Derailed\" (2005), who fares far better here than his debut, never resorts to the cheap tricks and gruesome visuals, while creating scares through a suffocating sense of claustrophobia and suspense. The movie appeals to an old-fashioned sense of horror that differs from your typical slasher flicks loaded with unrelenting carnage.\r Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a professional skeptic. He makes his living by visiting supposed haunted houses and writing about the absence of ghosts. For him, room 1408 at New York's Dolphin Hotel is too good a challenge to pass up. In its nearly 100 years of existence, 56 people have died in that room. The hotel's manager (Samuel L. Jackson) advises in the strongest terms that Mike not stay there. \"No one,\" he advises, \"has lasted more than an hour.\" At first, Mike is not impressed by the ordinariness of the accommodations. Then strange things begin happening, and by the time he decides that checking out early might be the wisest decision, that option no longer exists.\r Too often, we see a movie with a good setup ruined with a subpar ending. \"1408\" deftly sidesteps the pitfall, delivering a conclusion that manages not to disappoint, while at the same time leaving things open-ended enough for viewer interpretation. Most of the movie focuses on Cusack, alone in his room, trapped in an escalating environment of paranoia. He uses his good natured disposition to get the audience's acceptance, and once that's accomplished, the film has us. It's riveting to watch his cynicism and disbelief give way to the horror of what is actually happening. Despite Mike's mantra \"We don't rattle, do we?\" The answer is in fact, we do."

Here's a supernatural debunker faced with something that refuses to be debunked (see also The Reaping). And here's a movie about a room-for-rent where people go in but don't come out (see also Vacancy). Yet, despite all of these recycled plot elements bobbing around, there's nothing stale about 1408, which is easily the best horror film of 2007. Too often, we see a movie with a great setup like this ruined by a subpar ending. However, 1408 deftly sidesteps that trap, delivering a conclusion that somehow manages not to disappoint while at the same time leaving things open-ended enough that viewer interpretation comes into play.\r To say that movie adaptations of Stephen King stories have a checkered history is to understate the matter. The rule of thumb is that King's non-horror efforts have gotten much better treatment than his bread-and-butter fare. The rule doesn't apply here, though. While 1408 isn't on the same plane as The Shawshank Redemption or Misery, it's easily among the best King-inspired motion pictures to-date. It is by turns bold, scary, and downright creepy. The film doesn't try to do too much and what appears to be a dead give-away of things to come turns out to be nothing more than a delicious piece of misdirection. I love that sort of thing.

Cusack uses his sunny, good natured disposition to get the audience to like him and, once that's accomplished, the film has us. Director Mikael H\u00e5fstr\u00f6m is as adept at setting up \"boo!\" moments as he is at building and sustaining suspense. From the moment Mike enters the room, there's a growing sense of dread, but this is punctuated by instances of stark, sudden terror. This is H\u00e5fstr\u00f6m's second English language motion picture, and it's a considerable step up from his previous effort, the unsatisfactory Clive Owen/Jennifer Aniston thriller, Derailed.\r 1408 is divided into three clearly delineated acts. The first, which lasts about 30 minutes, is the setup. We meet Mike on the outside, get to know him a little, then follow his single-minded determination to remove all obstacles and get his story. The second act takes place with Mike alone in the room. This is the most eerie, unsettling portion of the movie and will forever change your opinion of a sentimental Carpenters' wedding classic. The third act is the shortest, but offers enough twists and switchbacks to turn what initially seems to be a conventional denouement into anything but that. You can see it coming\u2026 or can you? While the final scene won't frustrate anyone the way the ending of The Sopranos did, it's not clear-cut, either. There's room for interpretation, which is a rarity in any horror film.\r 1408 doesn't belong grouped with the likes of Hostel and Saw, because the filmmakers understand that fear gestates in the mind. Gore can as often diminish terror as enhance it. 1408 can be rated PG-13 and still frighten the crap out of viewers because of the way the director balances claustrophobia with suspense. Yet things never become too intense, which can be a danger with a movie like this. That's where John Cusack shines through. Even in the midst of a personal apocalypse, he can utter a one-liner to break the tension.\r The 15 rating might argue that 1408 is for teenagers, but that's a mistake. This is the most mature horror movie of the year - far more adult and sophisticated than the tedious Hostel Part II. If you like to be creeped out by movies, this is one to see. It reminds us what it's like to be scared in a theater rather than overwhelmed by buckets of blood and gore."

      "text": "Cusack has long been one of my favorite NON high profile actors because of his choice of movies in general. But alas he lost me on this one. This movie was simply a recylced FX vehicle and if anyone thinks it was more than that then they looked way too hard and deep. As is many American movies the beginnings have promise and then falter into the writers abyss. By that I mean they run out of any credible imagination, originality and passion. If your not going to make any sense at least attempt to be entertaining, which this movie was not. This movie on the making sense level was close to The Lakehouse and that my friends was baddddd. So.. not in great company I must say. Think I'll go and write a screenplay, never have attempted one but heck sure as hell couldn't be as bad."

I watched this online and afterwards threw my computer out the window. I then bought a new computer to order the movie online and then burn it. I have no respect for Stephen king now.
