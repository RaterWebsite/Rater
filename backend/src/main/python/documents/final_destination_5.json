      "text": "Blood, guts, gore and violence - we all know what we're getting with a movie like Final Destination 5. Even though you have probably heard of this movie long, long ago, and even though you have probably seen one or two of its sequels, Final Destination as a movie franchise has always found a way to bring new viewers into theaters. I saw the trailer for the latest installation, and I was hooked. Is it the lure of death that calls to us? Are we morbid for watching movies like this? Perhaps. But any way you slice it, Final Destination 5 is an adrenalin ride from start to finish. The acting is passable - even laughable at times, and the character development is strictly B movie, but man, oh man, what a B movie. Some of the set pieces are actually pretty compelling - just when you think you know what's going to happen - *WHAMMO!* *SLICE!* *GROAN* Another victim of death is served up on a platter for all to see. There are plenty of \"Oh My God\" moments in this otherwise predictable movie, and the squeamish will indeed look away - a lot - during the kill scenes. This movie is meant to be fun, and it is fun. The plot is rather silly and contrived, and - let's face it - just an excuse to get to the killing. If you liked Nicholas D'Agosto in \"Fired Up\", then you'll love him in Final Destination 5. Nicholas plays it straight as Sam, and he even has a love interest, but you know what happens to EVERYONE sooner or later - they all die! The hook or deus ex machina for FD 5 is the clever way the characters try to cheat death - again. For a fleeting moment, even the audience is convinced it will work... But if it did, we would not have much of a movie! The deaths keep coming right up to the movie's end. Speaking of the end, could this be the end of the series? During the final scene, as a young man is escorted screaming from an airplane, my buddy shouted, \"It's a prequel!\" Sure enough, as the credits rolled, the entire series was flash-forwarded in gruesome scene after gruesome scene. The end... for now.- Chipper F. Xavier, Esq."

I'm a fan of the Final Destination series, but in more recent years it has become a series like Saw that I once liked, but now just dutifully trudge through. That's why I was such a big fan of Final Destination 5. It's a shockingly good movie, and that's mainly because the characters are a touch above what you've come to expect from this series. The characters are likable, so you actually care about them and don't want them to get killed in these horrible ways. It's a shockingly simple difference between good and bad horror movies that so many films don't seem to understand. The deaths in this movie are really ingeniously tense, leaving the audience guessing where the death will come from and when they will happen. Other major positives for this film are the great score by Brian Tyler and the very smart and surprising twist ending. This is a strong revitalization for the series, and I hope it continues if they make anymore."

      "text": "Final Destination 5 is quite a bit of a mixed bag. There are elements present that suggest that it should be a better movie than it actually is, but looking at each of the series' sequels, it's quite an accomplishment that this one manages to be as good as it is. The opening premonition (a bridge collapsing, if, for some reason, you don't already know) is easily the best sequence of any of the five Final Destinations. It's an amazing technological accomplishment that manages to create a palpable sense of dread; though you know the it's-only-a-premonition gotcha! is right around the corner, tension yields to pure fear as the bridge crumbles away in three dimensions. If you're an adrenaline junkie, this scene alone is well worth the admittedly bloated price of admission. The rest of the film doesn't live up to this sequence, but there are moments when the filmmakers know how to get under your skin, such as the well-advertised trapped-in-a-Lasik-chair and screw-on-a-balance-beam scenes. It's unlikely that you'll be able to guess the outcomes of the over-elaborate but still bizarrely jarring deathtraps the characters find themselves in. Much has been said about this entry's use of characterization, which, following every sequel, is understandable. Let's simply say that there *is* characterization. The characters are somewhat bland, but occasionally funny. The actors are all right, but wooden lines of dialogue (the ones that have been heard in each Final Destination film) still sound stilted. If nothing else, they convey full ranges of fear and terror, two emotions that likely won't serve them outside of the horror genre. The film includes some plot twists, but does little of interest with them; if you have seen the trailer, you know of one, and if you pay attention, the second one is frustratingly easy to guess. In the end, there's fun to be had here, but as a good number of the critic's reviews will tell you, you probably know whether you want to see Final Destination 5 or not. (A little forewarning to those who, like me, pick up on certain details: when the bridge collapses \"for real,\" it collapses differently than in the premonition, which would, theoretically, change the order the characters \"should\" have died. The filmmakers don't make any use of this, so don't expect any curveballs of that sort. You can probably just regard it as what looks like a very expensive continuity error.)"

The brand has lasted for over a decade and has pulled itself out of the abyss just as the Saw franchise has. While there is nothing new about Final Destination 5 3D, it is amped up on 3D steroids. Every explosion and all of the carnage seem to be hurling at our faces at astronomical speeds. There is a reason why the paradigm remains the same for ordered deaths after death has missed its target; this episode pays homage to the series' roots and beginnings. It is essentially a mishmash of gore and pillaging that pays tribute to its predecessors.

It so crazy that I didn't know that they were going back where it started all. Once they were off, the flight etender asked what was going on. The passanger said that this guy had a vision that the plane was going to blow up in the mid-air. Sam had look around and there you go they died.

I was not expecting another film because the last one was titled \"The Final Destination\" Didn't even call it Final Destination 4. This movie has redeemed the quality of the series for me. One thing i really like is how every movie brought new up and coming actors/actresses and a lot have been good. Part 4 was so forgettable I don't remember any of the faces. Final Destination 5 is almost as good as part 2 But I enjoyed it a bit more then part 3. The story has the same formula which I do like but feared would make this one predictable. Instead they added a few more layers to the Story so as familiar as it feels it also feels new at the same time.The Special Effects are top notch, I am not talking a lot of flashy stuff I am talking a lot of Blending to make everything seem a lot more real. The death scenes are raising the bar, you would think with what we have seen 4 times that it would have desensitized us a lot more but the whole Theater went \"OOoooooo\". The actors brought a lot of fresh faces but they where really good, I feel a lot of these people could be future stars one day, but maybe my slandered are just very lowered due to how part 4 was (I need to stop mentioning part 4). Tony Todd (We all know him as the guy who played The Candy Man) reprises his creepy role as the Coroner who seems to be the only person who completely understands how Death works. I don't know about you but he still creeps me out after all these years, but hes a great actor non the less.The Sounds was incredible, very loud and detailed, enough to make you jump. I can't get the song \"Dust In The Wind\" out of my head now, that movie made that song Errie for life.The 3D portion was OK, Like part 4 you will see Guts and stuff in your face which really makes it that much more intense. But its not what makes this movie so if you have to catch it on DVD you wont miss too much, but I didn't regret paying more to see it in 3D.This is a movie where you want to go in as Fresh as possible, meaning you don't want to hear too many opinions about it or see too many clips, I have put the best Trailer at the bottom because the newer ones seem to show too much to me. Its been a while since I came out of the Theater happy after seeing a really awesome movie, at the end it received an applause (Which is the first i witnessed live at the movies) I Highly recommend this one to any Fans of the series, and to those new comers as I mentioned watch the first 3 movies first, if you enjoy them any you might like this one too."

Of course, the \"predictable\" cause of death is not going to do it.  Just expect a head to explode in some kind of totally unforeseeable way shortly after that \"close call.\" It's the lack of foreseeability that makes the movie not scary in the least.  The best horror movies thrive on anticipation - this goes completely the opposite way - quick death with zero build-up. Gory? Sure. But scary in the traditional sense?  Not at all.

However, after the premonition was over, i thought, \"that was it.\" The other Final Destination films, especially 2 were a lot better.  In terms of the individual deaths, i almost laughed at how fake and preposterous the first one was. I am not a gymnast, never have been, but if i fell off a balance beam, i would just roll over in pain, not be broken in half.  I know the deaths are supposed to be over the top, but this first one was just stupid.  What followed was just many annoying characters dying in fake-looking ways, exactly the other other films (not inventive at all).  Then end plane sequence was awesome as well as the collage of deaths from the other films.  Even as a somewhat FD fan, i was not impressed.  This was one of the less graphics films in the series."

      "text": "As the incoming waves ripple nearby, an exhausted knight, recumbently inacitve on a rock-laden shoreline, starts to question the legitimacy of the cross, so proudly embossed on his chain mail vest, as he stares vacantly at god's kingdom, where from his vantage point on the primordial beach, sees only clouds and sky, and an eagle traversing across a gutted sky, recently secularized by the knives of devotional uncertainty. Next, he washes his face in the ocean, violently shaking off the **** from righteous hands which killed in god's name; red-stained hands that are guilty of spilling Muslim blood across a European battlefield. If Antonius Block, the skeptical mounted soldier in Ingmar Bergman's \"The Seventh Seal\", had the gift of premonition to foresee his own demise, like Alex Browning from the original \"Final Destination\", would he have bowed out of the crusade, and encourage his squire Jons, already a full-blown infidel, to do so likewise? For the sake of argument, let's say that Antonius cheated his ill-fated outcome, prompting death to come for the knight, who deserted the ongoing clash, thereby messing with the Grim Reaper's wicked designs. Newly informed by the \"Final Destination\" films, Antonius gets cast in a new light when death pays the knight a visit, solving, for some, a long-standing question as to why the shrouded figure comes for the crusader now, having just survived the most perilous of situations, only to be sentenced, somewhat unfairly, during peacetime. Like the bridge that collapses in \"Final Destination 5\", the unsavory side of life goes on, with or without Sam and his co-workers, as was the case with the Ninth Crusade, which when filtered through \"Final Destination\" and its sequels, continued on without the knight and his squire's participation. Antonius doesn't seem at all surprised by his black company, conceding that this expropriation was long in the making. \"My flesh is afraid, but I am not,\" replies Antonius to death's question about his departure from the corporeal world, a blatant lie that directly addresses the disgraced knight's conflicting spirituality. Antonius, plagued with doubts about the existence of heaven, challenges the darkest adversary to a game of chess, in order to buy time for his devotional restoration, whose flagging conviction in god led to this crusader's resignation from the ranks of the soldiered brethren. For the knight, the visage on the witch's face, as the men prepare to burn the young girl at the stake, looks all-too-familiar. \"Her poor mind is making a discovery,\" observes the squire. Antonius knows. He has seen the \"emptiness\", on the battlefield. Interestingly enough, \"Final Destination 2\" proposes the same godless diegesis as \"The Seventh Seal\", when during the film's opening credits, a talk-show guest differentiates death from the devil as the unseen malevolent force that struck down the survivors of Flight 180. Instead of chess, in essence, these captive participants are playing hide and seek. Of note, Clear Waters hides out at a mental hospital(and not a church). Moreover, tropes innate to this horror series can be applied retroactively to the Bergman classic. For the time being, death skips Antonius, intervening on the knight's behalf by agreeing to the proposed chess match, so as a result, Skat dies instead, when the black-robed figure fells the tree he was hiding in. It's really no different from the case of Billy, who in the original, gets decapitated near the rails, after Alex pulls Carter out of his car, which he left lying across the railroad tracks, just before the collision which prompts the errant scrap metal toward their once-headed friend's direction. The theater director, who runs off with a blacksmith's wife during his troupe's performance in a small hamlet, was slated to die anyways. Death skips him(and the married woman) because of the squire's calming influence on the cuckolded artisan. Jons also saves a mute girl from being raped and murdered by a corrupt clergyman. However, as death and Antonius near the endgame to their chess match, the black figure says, \"No one escapes me,\", but Jof and Mia, Skat's actors, give it a go, even though, like the \"Final Destination\" films, wind signifies death's presence, as they flee by horse and carriage, thanks to the knight who, once again, meddles with the plan by creating a distraction with knocked-over chess pieces. (Alas, the wind will return.) True to his word, Antonius and his friends follow death up a hill to their final destination; their hands interlocked, like a chain. It was predestined, but the knight changed death's plan. Jof sees them from afar. The actor may have been lying about seeing the Virgin Mary, but not this. To the knight's disappointment, in death, he's probably not going to light up like Patrick Swayze in \"Ghost\". Antonius Block won't be meeting the gymnast, or any of the other eviscerated victims in heaven."

      "text": "FD5 shows hope for the series. As the first four installments progressed, the series seemed to be getting dumber and dumber as it went on. Firstly, I really liked the bridge collapse of the opening scene. Very intense, very dramatic (though not very realistic; there should have been a huge amount of wind that made the bridge oscillate for a few minutes. Instead, we see a small gust and then nothing). Secondly, I like the idea of the twist that if you take a life, you get to live the years that person would have lived. It's a fresh new take on a concept that was really getting stale after the first four movies. However, there seem to be just as many things to complain about as there are to commend. Firstly, the movie continues the not-so-time-honored tradition of using gore just for the sake of showing it. Instead of calculating its usage more so that it has a better impact every time it is shown, the movie just tosses blood all over the place most of the time, and some deaths seem almost as stupid as those in The Final Destination (don't even get me started on that movie!), for example the death scenes in the gym and the spa, which seemed so ridiculous that I wondered if the movie was making some strange attempt at humor. Secondly and lastly, the movie seemed to go by really fast. Maybe this is just me, but it seemed like the movie had less in it in general then previous installments have. Maybe I just lost track of time or something, but when the movie ended I didn't feel as though I'd just sat through a feature length flick. Overall, I can say FD5 is better then previous installments, and appears to be a hopeful restart to a series in need of rejuvenating. Though some of the death scenes are just stupid, the opening bridge scene and the intriguing murder twist make this movie one that is definitely worth seeing if you're an FD fan (otherwise maybe not so much)."

It was exciting when somebody died but the rest of it just dragged on. The only reason i saw this was because its what my friends chose and because i work at the movie theater and it was free for me. I only gave this mindless film a 2 because its actually some of the best 3d effects ive seen in a movie in a long time, but other than that this movie was stupid. 2/10"

Until they decided to go to cheap thrills for the rest of the movie. They even made the movie so predictable they told you what order the characters were to die in. Although I do give the director credit for creating some suspense in some scenes where any other director would have failed. On this one the script and the story let him down"

      "text": "Final Destination 5 is absolutely better then franchises previous two(FD 3 & 4) . The Bridge Scene was undoubtedly wonderful and its the second best accident scene (first being FD 2 car accident) of the franchise . The first half was so awesome . The first death was shown really well but after that all went  kinda boring and too fast . It felt like the writer got really bored while he was writing it & also the director .It could have been am amazing film start to end but the second half was worst then FD 3 (FD 4 being the worst of all) . Cast was good , they played well but it wasn't enough . Like the first three film it wasn't so deep into the story . The whole movie was like a candy bar , You started slowly but suddenly you see its all gone .I gave 6 rating because I loved The Bridge scene and Its CGI quality so much. Without this scene I would give the film max 3.0 rating .BTW i loved the was they showed the last scene ...I was expecting this and they finally showed it this time ."

      "text": "Eleven years ago Final Destination took horror fans in a fresh new direction. The film had gruesome death scenes (not nearly as bad as the later installments.) But fate -and whether one could escape its plan- was where the real intrigue lied. Final Destination 2 traded character development for sillier death scenes, but at least some were mildly possible and interesting. I had the foresight to avoid what i felt would be ridiculously bad films in the third and fourth installments of the franchise. Something told me this one would be different. The film is directed by James Cameron's understudy, David Quale; who admitted the last films didn't live up to the first two. Quale claims to have attempted to use what worked in the first films to construct his fifth installment. One would think at the very least this film would have made brilliant use of the 3D technology that was, of course, extraordinary in Avatar. Horror movies are possibly the best genre for 3D -because you're meant to be jumpy- but this film attempts to ease us in through credits that slowly come closer and closer to the audience, but it becomes rather boring. Moving forward, Quale decides to splatter our cool 3D shades with blood and guts rather than use the technology to scare us. Sure... the bridge scene was nice, but after that the film stumbles from poor dialogue to atrocious acting to fantastically unbelievable death scenes. I know there are those who will say I should have seen that coming. Maybe they're right, but the first film wasn't nearly as grotesque and was written much better. Even the second installment looks very believable in comparison. The deaths are way too much, I wanted to scream at the screen in my best Mortal Kombat voice \"finish him\" (already). We always get plenty of plausible ways for characters to meet their demise, but instead we see something like a character getting their head knocked off by the torso of a deer being propelled by a tornado. Who am I kidding? That would be much too interesting for this film. One or two scenes should have surprised us by taking one of the more obvious deaths. Sam and his friends are mostly played by relative newcomers, but along the way, we meet some nice characters. Tony Todd (Candyman) is back as the coroner. He actually has a few terrifically ominous lines. And David Koechner (The Office) plays his usual oblivious character well. As a fan of the original I did enjoy the plot twist, which does something that I can't remember ever being done before. In the end, this installment may have done what it set out to do; make a better movie than Final Destination 3 or The Final Destination (the fourth film which claimed to be the last.) If the filmmakers wished for anything more however, they should have spent as much time crafting dialogue and story as they did dreaming up 1,000 ways to die."

      "text": "As soon as it began I thought, \"this is so stupid\" and this thought is repeated throughout the movie along with a regret for spending money on it.  I have seen all the FD.  Even after 4, which was pretty bad, I came back to see if this was improved.  It was NOT.  Full of goriness true, but the story line was horrible, premonitions not believable or along with the great suspense of the main character getting them and trying to stop death from getting the others.  And then to add, all of a sudden that they could cheat death by taking another person's life when in FD 2 they had said only a \"new life\" could break the chain...we all remember the pregnant character Sabella Hudson (portrayed by Justina Machado) was one of the survivors of the Route 23 pile up accident. Isabella was a delievery girl who was also nine months pregnant only to find out it was actually back from death to life...remember Kimberly sacrifices herself for Officer Burke's safety by driving the van she is riding to a lake, however Officer Burke rescues her and sends her to a hospital for recovery. I wondered if the people who wrote 1 and 2 were the same ones that wrote 5..I am officially DONE with Final Destination movies.  This was a true disappointment."

Beforehand, we went to the gas station to get gas, but the gas pumper didn't tighten the gas cap properly, forcing it to come off. Someone helped me out, but for him it was sadly too late. A bolt of lighting hit the fuel, causing a fire that led to his car. For whatever reason, his door just didn't want to open he was unforgettably burnt alive. That was one year ago. Opps, I spilled water on my plugs. I'll have to clean them right now."

      "text": "I was honestly expecting a lot more from this movie. Hearing that the producers claimed that this installment would be the darkest in tone since the first movie, I got pumped because it was great hearing that this movie wouldn't be go for the comedy route that the 4th movie took. Sadly, I was a little let down. The mediocre-to-bad acting was one thing, but the film had some jokes that I felt were a little forced and thus ruined whatever serious tone the film was going for. However, I must state that the use of 3D was surprisingly effective when I saw it in theaters. The death scenes are classic Final Destination as expected. There's some fun to be had here, but if the film took itself more seriously and perhaps different actors were chose for their roles, this could have been a really fun movie."

      "text": "Another group of obnoxious and ridiculously attractive 20-somethings learn that you can't cheat death. It adds a new wrinkle to the mix by giving the survivors an option to escape the cycle by killing someone outside of it, but for the most part this is the exact same thing you've likely seen four times already. No real surprises here.That being said, it is an improvement on its predecessors. The special effects are pretty bad, but the kills themselves are great. Very gory. This is easily the funniest Final Destination and while you're still not likely to actually like these characters they are the most memorable bunch of the franchise.It's more of the same, but slightly better than all the previous iterations. The ending will be a real treat for longtime fans. It shows signs of there still being gas in the tank should anyone decide to pull the series off the shelf at some point. While still nothing special, 5's increase in quality does have my inner gorehound clamouring for more."
