      "text": "True, it's sappy, predictable fluff, but it's pretty good sappy, predictable fluff. After seeking out several lorenzos (the remake, if set in the u.s., would no doubt name him darrell), granny finally finds her man... and zounds, a jillion years since their first meeting at (her) age 15, he's still alive. [***SPOILER***] Sadly, she would expire just months later. also, sadly, this theater didn't offer kettlekorn. whenever i leave a theater without having downed a bucket, i figure if I'm happy, it was a decent flick. better logic than many professional critics out there I'd say."

I usually love fluffy chic flicks but this one really goes over board at times..the soundtrack and use of music doesnt help in this regard. However, you do get to see beautiful Italy and the two main characters played by Egan and Seyfried are charming. Egan is especially cute. Bring your girlfriends or wait for the rental!"

      "text": "This is a movie that believes in emotion and sentiment. If you go in looking for drama or action you're gonna be disappointed. It works on a lot of levels. Its visually beautiful. The cinematographer even makes NYC look nice. Having been to both Verona and Sienna I can say that they are truly as beautiful as in the film. Are there corny parts? Yah! Love usually has corny parts. Go with an open heart and you won't be disappointed."

      "text": "At the 1978 Academy Awards ceremony, Vanessa Redgrave did a very punk rock thing; she spoke her mind. While accepting her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Fred Zimmerman's \"Julia\", Redgrave, a PLO supporter, referred to the Jewish Defense League as \"Zionist hoodlums\", in response to the death threats, and the witnessing of herself being burned in effigy outside The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. \"Arafat's whore\"(as she was called) did not stick to the script. Needless to say, Redgrave was lustily booed by her peers. Three months earlier, as \"Julia\" was doing solid business in theaters nationwide, fellow Brit Elvis Costello whipped up some civil disobedience of his own, scaring NBC censors when the punk rocker brought \"Less Than Zero\" to a screeching halt, before ordering the Attractions to start anew with \"Radio Radio\" on \"Saturday Night Live\". But nobody stays irascible forever, as evidenced by Costello's collaborations with artists outside the realm of popular music, most notably, The Brodsky Quartet, the esteemed musicians who backed the former angry young man on \"The Juliet Letters\", a baroque anti-rock cycle of songs inspired by a Verona professor's answering of letters that were postmarked for the famed Capulet. Redgrave, as well, in \"Letters to Juliet\", playing Claire, an old woman searching for a man named Lorenzo, fifty years(incidentally, the same numerical edition of the Oscars that yielded her gold statuette) after forsaking her first love, would seem to have mellowed out, likewise. Despite Claire's maternal gravitation toward the motherless Sophie(Amanda Seyfried), recipient of a tender hairbrushing and other surrogate mother actions, Redgrave goes rogue on us. In an act of protestation against the film's sentimentalism, the old woman gives a one-finger salute to the whole drippy enterprise, disguised as an itch on her forehead that she scratches with her middle digit during a luncheon among the Secretaries of Juliet. Does \"Letters to Juliet\" deserve it. Not really. But how punk."

Anyways Letter is a sweet charmer, and sure it's predictable, but so what. Fantastic scenery, good performances all round and Vanessa Redgrave was superb. What a magnificent, radiant presence to light up the screen. So against expectations I thoroughly enjoyed it. And even had a little weep. And I'm so tired of cynical critics who just seem to get off trashing everything they can (no wonder they're a dieing breed). Movies don't have to be great works of art, they can just be entertaining and heart warming."

      "text": "The tagline is: what if you had a second chance to find true love? It all begins like Taylor Swift song LOVE STORY, -We were both young, when I first saw you-. There is a place in Verona where broken-hearted women wrote their letters and attached it on the wall. Those letters will be replied by a group called Juliet Secretaries. By her curiosity, Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) got involved into the group, while she was on vacation with her fianc\u00c3\u00a9, Victor (Gael Garc\u00c3\u00ada Bernal). Sophie accidentally found an unanswered letter, and tried to reply it back after 50 years. The letters which wrote by a woman named Claire (Vanessa Redgrave), takes them to a quest to find Claire first love, Lorenzo Bartolini. Young Bartolini once asked Claire to run away with him. Thiz part is when the song says, -Romeo takes me somewhere we can be alone, I will be waiting all there has left to do is run-. But young Claire never showed up. Meanwhile, Claire grandson, Charlie (Christopher Egan) comes along to join their road trip adventure. Later, Sophie and Charlie have found their self actually they also have special feeling with each other. Amanda Seyfried had always been my personal favorite Actress since I first saw her in MAMMA MIA! (2008). But I have to admit her acting did not show particular improvement yet. Seyfried chemistry with Egan as her love interest is extremely poor. It seems Egan does not know what to do with his role. Gael Garc\u00c3\u00ada Bernal who I respected him as an extraordinary Actor in Indie movies (such as: Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN (2001), THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES (2004) and others), also made one dimensional performance with his monotone behavior. Vanessa Redgrave shows better performance as Claire, although it is not so special either. A good story to tell, but missed almost all aspects in directing, the man who is responsibility for that is Gary Winick (also directed CHARLOTTE WEB (2006) and BRIDE WARS (2009)). In Fact, the emotions are barely flat throughout the entire movie. Despite its obvious inadequacies, there is one heartwarming moment, when at last Claire met Charlie again. Their reunion healed their long lost love, the believability was effective. That is the time we came to the end of the song, -You will never have to be alone, I love you and that is all I really know-. Fabulous letter but did not get delivered.\r Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"

Talking that the movie is characteristically romantic and it has clich\u00c3\u00a9s might seems negative but in this case is not. The movie is so well written, the script is genial, the performances are truthful, the photography is beautiful, the soundtrack is so charming... without words. For those who likes romance it's a obrigatory movie. Probably a modern classic hence a couple years."
