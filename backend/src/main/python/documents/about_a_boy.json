  "description": "Will Freeman is a good-looking, smooth-talking bachelor whose primary goal in life is avoiding any kind of responsibility. But when he invents an imaginary son in order to meet attractive single moms, Will gets a hilarious lesson about life from a bright, but hopelessly geeky 12-year-old named Marcus. Now, as Will struggles to teach Marcus the art of being cool, Marcus teaches Will that you're never too old to grow up.",

      "text": "Movie had a lot of potential, but just fell apart at the end, as it veered too far away from Hugh Grant's character and started meandering all over the place. It felt more manipulative and cheap than heartfelt, and never really made me believe that Hugh Grant had suddenly turned some sort of magical corner. The problem with the movie is the problem with nearly all of Hornby's books - we're supposed to believe that the characters turn a corner but don't completely come around the bend. This works much better in his novels than in the three movie adaptations there have been of his novels thus far. On the screen the \"he's sort of a good guy, but not quite\" just doesn't leave you feeling complete when you leave the theater."

Will appeal to those looking for light not-too-dumb fare with a bit of crowd pleasing charm and humor. But that's the extent of it. It is not bad, nor is it very good."

      "text": "It's nice enough to sit through all the way. I found myself faintly smiling now and then, but it never makes you laugh out loud. Nor does it really hit the heart in any way. Strange, because the story has the potential. The main character who lives all his life superficially, suddenly finding himself having a real, loving connection with some people. Shouldn't that be story enough for a tissue or two?"

As the friendship progresses he learns from the kid what life is actually about. While it doesn't have many side splitting moments it does entertain and is definitely worth checking out."

      "text": "It's eccentric, often crude, and seamlessly silly, but About A Boy finds its stride at the forefront of most non-commital men, children.\rHugh Grant has left his stammering,stuttering baby-face like persona back home and s extremely confident and funny as the free-wheeling and hedonistic bachelor Will, a man living off his fathers one hit wonder Christmas song, and this film picks up through the central character trying to pick up women at SPAT (Single  Parents Alone Together). Through this, he runs into the weird and wonderfully blank Marcus, (the debut of Nicholas Hoult). What follows is a simply hilarious chain events where Marcus appears to be the only person privy to Wills plans and so begins to visit him everyday after school to just socialise (and watch Countdown) and even discuss girl problems, a 12 year old versus a 38 year old. The story is told through a double narration from both Marcus and Will, attempting to clarify and explain their friendship with each other, from Marcus continuing struggles with his suicidal mother (the excellent Toni Collette) and Will's attempt to start a relationship with Rachel (Rachel Weisz).\rThis film deals with all the typical problems seen in a dysfunctional lifestyle, which in turn shows to be quite a frequent theme in most peoples lives, troublesome children, marriage, sex, single parents, it all appears in a light-hearted attempt to show the trial and error ways of dealing with children, mid-life crisis etc.\rWith a wonderfully ridiculous climax, this film will indeed play on the heartstrings in  mild-mannered fashion that only a British comedy can deliver, it has all the great performances, particularly the two leads, a stepping out of the comfort zone Hugh Grant is especially convincing as the care-free bachelor but it was young Nicholas Hoult, whose career undoubtedly went from strength to strength after this role, stole the show as the young, confused, but not so naive Marcus, who takes no bull from anyone, typically as most children are, but a lot of nerve would have had to go into accepting that role and he embraced it with every fibre. Another excellently delivered British flick that will not fail to amuse a wider variety of audiences, whether its coming-of-age or simple twists on a rom-com, definitely worth watching."

      "text": "About a Boy movie was a good translation of the book but lacked some important details. The movie show perfect images given by the book but main points were not reached. The movie also seemed rushed and just speed across the deep situations that needed more explanation and more focus. Even though the movie left out some parts which helped show the change Marcus went through, it was a great example of the novel and was also very heartwarming."

In the end everyone's relationship with each other turned out pleasant in the movie but, they missed a big scene between Elli and Marcus. The ending of the book showed more of the point of \"about a boy\"."

      "text": "I wouldn\u2019t say About a Boy is a masterpiece, but it\u2019s quite a funny and touching story that\u2019s better than the book.  The casting was great; I particularly liked Hugh Grant and Nicholas Holt (who, fun fact, is one of the stars in the X-Men film franchise as young Hank McCoy, aka Beast) as Will and Marcus.  One of the reasons why I thought the movie was better than the book was because the movie\u2019s ending was better than the novel\u2019s ending because it had a lighter side.  The only thing that was my least favorite difference was when Will told Rachel the truth about him and Marcus.  In the novel, she seemed a little confused at first, but then didn\u2019t seem to mind.  In the movie, their relationship ended, but became a couple again after she saw Will helping Marcus out with his music performance at school.  Overall, it\u2019s a very good movie.  The only thing that concerns me, however, is the rating.  Usually, some PG-13 movies have one or more use of the f word.  But in this movie, it\u2019s more than a couple, which should\u2019ve given the movie an R rating"

The movie is well written, the characters are humane and you care and feel everytime for every character. The drama part lasts enough for you to care and is short enough for not becoming on eof the movies \"that makes you laugh and punches you in the face\". Hugh Grant is great, i really enjoyed this piece."
