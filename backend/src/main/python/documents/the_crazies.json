Good retelling of a Romero classic."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "In a film year of remakes such as The Karate Kid, highly awaited sequels such as Toy Story 3 and film adaptations of television shows such as M. Night Shyamalan's The Last Airbender, Breck Eisner's remake of George Romero's classic, The Crazies stands out from the rest. The plot concerns a small Iowa town where the town sheriff (Timothy Olyphant) begins to notice some residents acting out violently. Soon the army arrives and seals off the town and Olyphant is cut away from his pregnant wife (Radha Mitchell) who is mistaken as an infected. After breaking into the town and rescuing his wife Olyphant, his wife, his deputy, and a nurse from his wife's office must escape the county before they are either killed by the infected or the army. While the plot may seem a bit standard to other horror films of the present day the plot does have enough suspense and terror to sustain it. The film's acting was very well done, while not excellent it was better than most horror remakes. In most horror remakes such as The Wolf Man (2010) the actors primarily walk through their roles with no true inspiration, but the cast led by Olyphant does their best and appears to actually care about the roles at hand. They all have their own personalities and conflicts which allows for them to work outside the broad stereotypes associated with the horror genre(examples-hero, victim, hot female lead). The military appears as cold in their plans and their look. They are dressed in black and green and always wear their gas masks giving them an unearthly look. Visually the film worked in its set-ups and locales. Their is a sense of isolation and tension in many of the shots within the town and of the weakness felt by the characters. For instance when the film begins we are treated to a shot of the town's center district in ruins and flames and then we seen a shot only a few days prior showing the unassuming town as it was. Gore-wise the film does not fail, the effects are well done in their execution each spilling a ton of blood of screen. Fans of other horror films such as the Nightmare series (1984-2010) and Friday the 13th series (1980-2009) will not luck out. Unlike other films like The Wolf Man the gore is not overused or out of place in most scenes. Despite the better aspects the film does contain its faults. The gore effects which are well done are rather graphic and some viewers may have problems watching it, but gore hounds will love it beyond a reasonable doubt. Overall for a remake, The Crazies works better than most and is one of the best movies so far this year."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Russell Clank(Joe Anderson), Ogden Marsh's deputy, comes to terms with his erratic behavior; he's paranoid and has a trigger-itch temper, which are symptomatic of the \"crazies\", so the infected lawman creates a diversion in order for the Duttons(Timothy Olyphant & Radha Mitchell) to escape the military soldiers' notice. Hands in the air, Russell approaches the barricade, then provokes the army to take the first shots when he waves his gun in the air. On the ground, wounded, Russell's last words are, \"F*** you. For what you did,\" which pertains to the systematic destruction of this small Iowa town, but could have more far-reaching connotations, as Russell could be a stand-in for some universal citizen who withstood a bevy of American military campaigns, in which heavy casualties were involved. It's no accident that \"The Crazies\" is set in the midwest, a region of the country where people are less likely to be contemptuous toward the direction of our foreign policy. \"The Crazies\" is no \"Blue Velvet\", but the opening scene that highlights a farmer traversing the baseball field with a shotgun, almost serves the same function as the famous opening montage in the David Lynch film. Instead of carnivorous bugs buried in the grass, a carnivorous government is responsible for something buried in the swamp. Ogden Marsh is a town full of patriotic ideologues. At a funeral home, the mortician sews shut the eyes of his clients, the very same people who proudly display the American flag outside their homes. Here, the filmmaker shows how having blind faith in the integrity of our government's actions can sometimes get you killed. Nobody blinks an eye when innocent people die abroad. But when a plane carrying biological weapons crashes in the swamp, the ideologues experience what the other \"crazies\" in the Middle East experience. Most pointedly, the Duttons and their two fellow travellers watch as a mother and her son are shot in cold blood, even though they might not be \"crazy\". \"The Crazies\" might not be a political movie for some, and that's fine, because even if the moviegoer watches it like a zombie, it also works as a superior suspense/thriller."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "I really liked this movie.

Although I've never seen the original I really enjoyed the new version. It doesn't really bring anything new to the table but in referencing modern films such as 28 Days Later and the Dawn of the Dead remake the movie had an undeniable ferocity to it and it's no doubt disturbing. The film centers around a small town where the residents begin acting strangely and than psychotically. Unlike other similar films they're still people but they act out on murderous impulses and have a great time while doing it. The movie is edge of your seat and the lead performances from hunky Josh Duhamel (Scream 2) and Radha Mitchell (Silent Hill) as the sheriff and the town doctor are solid and relatable. Also good are Danielle Panabaker (Friday the 13th remake) and Joe Anderson (Horns). Although it covers familiar territory it does so in a refreshing way. All in all it's entertaining and creepy.Budget: $20mDomestic Box Office: $39mWorldwide Box Office: $55m3.75/5"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "I just realized, after some reading, that this film is a remake of another film, already forgotten, from the Seventies. I will not be able to compare them, I have never seen him, but I will see. What I can say, surely, is that this film did not enchant me and I expected something more. The film is good enough to be worth it, but I don't know if I would be interested in seeing it a second time. I don't think it justifies it.All the action takes place in a small village in the North American Midwest, where a mysterious virus is causing a terrible contagious disease that spreads through the air and makes people go crazy and start behaving like psychopaths and murdering other people just because. The film does not enter into big rounds, nor does it present much of the situation: like the inhabitants of that place, we too are surprised and do not know exactly what is happening. From here, the film follows the attempts of the local sheriff and his assistant to leave the city without being arrested or even killed by the army, which invades the region.The film is not bad, but its loaded with clich\u00e9s and uninspired scenes without originality, as if the director, Breck Eisner, had no confidence or interest in what he was doing and decided to just imitate \"The Walking Dead\" and other similar material. In addition, this film has a mostly average or mediocre cast, which neither shines nor adds anything truly good to the film. The exceptions are Timothy Olyphant and Joe Anderson, who gave life to the sheriff and his assistant in a competent and very committed way, where they would have surely achieved a better result with better material.At a technical level, its a film that fulfills what it promises: it has good cinematography and the sets and costumes are realistic and quite pleasant, but these are features that we could almost demand. The film keeps a pleasant pace, the visual, special and sound effects are very good and realistic. What I think was quite exaggerated was the creation of a whole ending so absolutely cataclysmic that it becomes far-fetched, like a parody.

I can't help but watch them. Most of these movies fall into the B-movie category; The Crazies is no exception.The Crazies is an adaptation of a 1973 film of the same name. Gearge A. Romero directed the original; here, he's an executive producer. I discovered this fact while researching to write this review.In The Crazies, David, sheriff of the fictional town of Odgen Marsh, Iowa, has to shoot a civilian who showed up armed with a shotgun at a baseball game. The civilian was clearly affected by something that prevented him from thinking. Here, I think the problems are already starting for me. Odgen Marsh is a small town, with just over 1200 inhabitants, but it seems that there are only two police officers in town: David, the sheriff, and Russell, his assistant deputy.A man armed with a shotgun shows up at a high school baseball game, and no one decides to take shelter. David clearly shoots in self-defense, and yet it seems that some of the population condemn him for the act (but here, I can even see reality with today, where some values \u200b\u200bseem inverted.)David and Russell are super smart. Sometimes I don't like how protagonists can't seem to put the ends together, but David and Russell put them together accurately. In less than half an hour, they already knew they were dealing with some pathogen.A scene that ends in a scare felt forced just to cause pointless tension. David and Russell were working as a team, but for no apparent reason, David decides to go out alone when he realizes the problem is serious. A bizarre scene ends with a pretty dumb scare, with a guy with no chance of seeing warning David that someone is right behind him.There is little explanation about the pathogen. Despite an agent describing it as deadly, the only confirmed symptom is that the hosts become extremely aggressive. I couldn't close a pattern beyond aggression: at times, the hosts seem erratic; in others, they seem smart enough to set traps. The lack of consistency makes some scenes feel exploitative.Some scenes are classic horror scenes, like when David can't restart the car he just turned off. Others are funny for the wrong reasons, for example, when Judy, David's wife, decides to take the towels off the line because of an anxiety attack. However, the film is consistent in keeping us tense and curious for the end.One thing that annoyed me about the protagonists is the fact that they always walk on the road. At one point, they even ask if it's a bad idea, and indeed it is. Exposing yourself in this way is clearly idiotic; why not follow the road from a safe distance?The climax was expected. The events are tense, but the main reason for the events themselves was obvious to me from the middle of the movie.The outcome was acceptable. The scenes during the end credits, however, open the possibility for a sequel or a prequel, two aspects not explored until then. Considering the box office results, I imagine that these movies will not see the light of day.Recommended if you are a fan of movies about infection. The film is very simple because it only focuses on the survival aspect without wanting to be scientific, but it works. These types of movies aren't for everyone, that's for sure."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "I pretty much like the actors but omg what's the point remaking an old movie if you cut everything out.
