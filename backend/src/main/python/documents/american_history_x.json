He takes this deeply troubled character who comes to realize what is truly going on his life and he knocks it out of the park. He was terrific and put the film on his shoulders and absolutely killed it. The director, Tony Kaye, while he wishes to distance himself from the final product, he did a great job as well. There was some beautiful imagery here and while it may not be the version he intended as the final cut, his vision absolutely is here and the messages it provokes is still powerful. Really, after watching this film, I felt like I had been hit by a ton of bricks. The entire film is so moving and affecting that it really leaves you in a trance once it ends and the credits start rolling. On top of that, there are many powerful scenes, but none as powerful as the final one. It really leaves you on the brink of tears as you try to deal with what you just watched.\r A truly mesmerizing character study with a heart and soul, American History X should absolutely be considered a \"must watch\" for all."

Edward Norton gives an absolute masterclass and the two performances he gives either side of his characters transition are both incredibly captivating. There's no doubting how manipulative and pretentious this film can be. And at times the propaganda can even feel persuasively targeted at the audience. But to the films credit that's what makes it so compelling. And ultimately you cannot believe such evil, destructive & irrational people like this actually exist. Tony Kaye's overall direction is impressive and the black and white sequences in particular look stunning. American History X is certainly a tough film to enjoy but personally I think it's essential viewing and an incredibly bold piece of filmmaking."

There are people that actually live their lives like the neo-nazis in this film, and American History X absolutely does not sugarcoat it. It shows the true colors of some of those people in our world, yet it doesn't bash them. It shows their intentions, shows us why they do what they do, and while we don't agree at all with it, we understand. Edward Norton gives the performance of a lifetime in what is a film that everyone should watch before they die."

Also, even though the shawshank redemption has some intense, disturbing, and even gritty scenes American history x beats all of them just with the, \"bite the curb,\" scene. Also, I can guarantee you that if you watch the shawshank redemption and then watch American history x not only will you say American history x is better and not only will you be suggesting it to everyone you know, ( Spoilers ahead) but you will also be crying when Danny Vinyard gets killed in the bathroom at the end of American history x."

      "text": "Why did I watch it?\rRecorded this one a while ago while it was on as it's always been one of those films I've wanted to watch, purely based on its controversy, but somehow never got around to.\r What's it all about?\r Norton beefed up for the role A story of two LA neo-nazi brothers, American History X stars Edward Norton and Edward Furlong as Derek and Danny Vinyard. Angry with perceived injustices against the white population of Venice Beach and the nation as a whole on top of the murder of their father by a black drug dealer, the pair embrace the teachings of a local supremeist. The film alternates between the present day and flashbacks chronicling the relationship of the pair as the older brother, Derek (Norton), gets drawn into trouble with the gang and later tries to prevent his younger brother from making the same mistakes as him.\r Should you watch it?\rViolent, powerful and controversial, American History X is a hard-hitting drama dealing with a difficult but realistic subject and at times can be hard to watch. Obviously bearing in mind the subject matter, the script is unpleasant at times but the decision to give both characters a high degree of intelligence was a smart one as it at least allows them to put forward their argument in a reasonably articulate manner.\rEdward Norton is absolutely excellent as the older brother before and after his run in with the law and totally deserved his Oscar nomination. Furlong also deserves credit for his performance and it's disappointing that he didn't go on to better things from this. The black and white older footage, when Norton is at his angriest, adds to the powerful nature of the film and was a masterstroke. Norton's angry, shaven-headed, white and Nazi-tattoo clad torso in black and white is, from a cinematic perspective, a pretty powerful and controversial image."

The thing with this topics in films is that they are very easy to mess up, or become cliche.

Edward Norton is in one of the best jobs of his career (if not the best); The film at the beginning proposes an idea, but from a certain point it shows that it is there for something else, a beautiful work of a script well written, I have to praise the script and much; What a story, I swear that in the end it surprised me; Because although I already expected that I did not expect it that way, although there are colorful scenes that stand out even in black and white, I have already praised it once and I will continue to praise the way the black and white scenes became sensational, if The whole movie was in this way would only improve this great work that deserves to be recognized. At the end of it all that guy who people did not believe that would change changed and everything because he saw the other side of the coin, saw that all are equal and despite everything some day we can depend on that person we do not like, we hate and among them we One can see the trust and other things that we do not see in those we treat equally just because they are of the same color; American History x is a work of art and undoubtedly one of the best movies I have ever seen!"

Tony Kaye does a great job in telling this story and discussing these topics, although it may not have turned out the way he intended to. Edward Norton arguably delivers the best performance in his entire career and it's such a shame that he didn't win an Oscar for it, and Edward Furlong also does a great job in his role. I also love how the film tells its story in a non-linear sequence, as it utilizes the black and white cinematography to showcase the flashbacks and cuts between the past and the present. There are some gruesome violent and sex scenes that I found it a bit hard to watch, but it doesn't take away from the experience. A must see classic that still remains relevant today and will go on to become one of the greatest films ever made."

      "text": "Finally got to write a review for this great great movie. It's definitely emotional, touching, sad, but it was a great experience watching it. Amazing performances. The movie says, that a man can change, but actually there need to be a big factor for that to happen  (like getting into prison, kidding). And there are always two sides of the story (the end). Of course, there where some unnecessary things. I promised to my boyfriend to mention it.. That little penis there in the bad room was totally unnecessary, like I laugh a lot to this 5cm hairy thing. :D"

      "text": "A mess of a film that attempts some kind of message but fails dismally. Just like \"The Green Mile\" and \"Once Were Warriors\" before it, the film tries so hard to get a reaction from the audience that it ends up feeling forced and exhausting."
