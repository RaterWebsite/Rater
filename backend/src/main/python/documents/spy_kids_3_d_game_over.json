It relies on the viewers understanding of the previous films' characters without attempting to expand upon them or the new ones introduced. Family themes and comedic spy jokes are now replaced with unfunny video game quirks that are too generic for even a gamer to enjoy. Mix in some terrible CGI and little relevant messages or references, Spy Kids 3D was as dated then as it is today."

It is the third movie in the \u201cSpy Kids\u201d franchise. This time like the title suggest it is set in a video game like virtual reality. The story starts when Juni Cortez is persuaded to a last mission as his sister is trapped in a virtual reality video game called \u201cGame Over\u201d. Because it will be released in a few hours million people can be trapped too. This is the set up for the story. It is a fun video game themed story. Maybe a bit to cliche and too many tropes but enjoyable for me. The cast of the previous movies return and deliver their roles. However the new characters area bit mixed. Especially Sylvester Stallone earned his golden raspberry well deserved (Not his fault as I think it was the script). The special effects were nice and fit the theme of the movie. Overall I think this is fun to watch and you should not overthink it too much. It is one of the turn your brains off movies to enjoy which to be fair can be hit or miss."

Spy Kids 3 is a failure with awful visual effects that are easy to notice, tons of dull characters, dull gaming references (They just said the words Sega, Atari, Namco, Metroid and Halo), moments that barely have any emotions and a really terrible ending and plot twist (Villian is just asked to give up and the main character has to give up his crush, which really disappoints me)."

Si no fuera por sus problemas creo que seria f\u00e1cilmente la mejor de la saga.Primero que nada, de la trilog\u00eda se siente la mas apurada a nivel general, hay muchas cosas que quedan sin explicar como la relacion entre Toymaker y el abuelo y que hizo este para ser su enemigo y dejarlo discapacitado, as\u00ed como la famosa frase \"Quien sabe, fue hace a\u00f1os\", cuando Juni pregunta sobre porque encerraron a Toymaker. Enserio, esta tiene que ser una de las excusas mas baratas que he visto en una pelicula para \"justificar\" un hueco argumental. Los guionistas eran tan vagos?!Tambien graficamente hay partes en las que destacan pero otras no... y el 3D... es bastante malito la verdad. No todas las escenas, pero si la mayoria. La pelicula tambien hace referencias a videojuegos pero estas se sienten desaprovechadas. Aun asi muchas escenas de accion son muy buenas, como la carrera por ejemplo, de las mejores escenas con diferencia. Ademas el DVD trae cosas muy interesantes, incluyendo un minijuego muy entretenido.La considero la peor de la trilogia, sin embargo, creo que esta lejos de ser mala, ya que en sus puntos mas altos creo que supera a la 2 que es mi favorita, aunque tambi\u00e9n tiene sus puntos mas bajos. A d\u00eda de hoy la sigo viendo y me sigue divirtiendo. Solo espero que si llegan a hacer otra similar a esta no pongan una excusa barata como \"Quien sabe fue hace a\u00f1os\" o algo as\u00ed porque los huecos argumentales son fallos importantes, y que se burlen del espectador de esa forma no es gracioso."

Where Ready Player One is filled with vapid fan service and shiny CG, Spy Kids has heart and the characters show growth throughout their journey. The relationship between Juni and Dmitria had a a strong impact on me, much more than Wade and Artemis could ever have. Dmitria's sacrifice for Juni had weight, as she presumably died when the game was shut down. There were also strong themes about family ties and family being bigger than your bloodline which I appreciated."

The film is bad.The 3-D effects are bland, minus 1 point;The CGI was awful for 2003, and even worse than the first two movies' CGI. Also, they overused CGI, and it doesn't hold up, it did not age well at all, minus 1 point;There are MANY cliches in the film, from the concept of \"The Guy\" is WAY too similar to the Matrix's \"The One\" and Harry Potter's \"The Chosen One.\" And then comes the worst part, Elijah Wood's appearence that only lasted seconds until he immediately died. Minus 1 point;But the actors did an alright job at performing their famous roles, so there goes the only plus 1 point.All in all, the film gets a 3/10 from me."
