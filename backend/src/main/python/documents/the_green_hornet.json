      "text": "More important than the story being told here, though, is how much fun the film seems to be having in telling it. Michel Gondry is best known for whimsical arthouse fare, but tasked with directing a superhero movie, he finds a way to put his own stamp on an established genre without dodging the blockbuster movie style Sony\u2019s bean counters were probably hoping for. The movie\u2019s packed with fun gadgets and crazy visual effects, some of which are so outside the box that in another film they might seem strange. Here though, most of them work brilliantly because Gondry\u2019s movie never takes itself too seriously. When reality gets in the way of having fun with the moment, The Green Hornet is more than happy to ignore it. Gondry\u2019s vision is a perfect fit with the comedic tone of the script, written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Their film is as much a comedy as it is an action movie, actually it\u2019s better than that, it\u2019s one of the all too rare modern movies which manages to be both."

Critics do not know what they are talking about. A movie is supposed to follow the \"Hero's Journey\" and this my friends follows the classic example of a Hero's Journey. All the way from the Call to adventure to the return, it takes a funny take with amazing acting, Seth Rogen and Jay Chou. Cameron Diaz could have done a better job. But in conclusion the movie was great, I enjoyed myself"

When you watch, you need to realize that it is intentionally corny and quirky. The negative reviewers don't get the movie's sense of humor. It's one of the most well made action comedies of all time. It provides thorough enjoyment from start to finish. Fans of comedies will enjoy, as well as fans of action films. It's definitely worth your time, and you'll want to see repeat viewings. I highly congratulate what the film makers of this movie have done."

She went with the others to see \"The King's Speech\" while my brother and I went to see this(in case you understand, we haven't read the comic books that had The Green Hornet) to make sure whether its good or not. it turned out good. so, what's my opinion? um, how about this: The storyline lasted a little bit longer for a 119 minute film, but for an Action/Comedy movie, everything else is good. Seth Rogen and the rest of the cast are great, The Comedy is hilarious, The action scenes are very cool, and the visuals are very astounding.\r Sorry Critics, but looks like I'm going against you.

He's the kind of moron that turns up to a party thinking he owns the place, puts other people down, throws insults at people and everyone wishes that he'd just go the **** away. I know that his character was designed to be like this and there have been characters such as this before (which were done so much better) but the performance in this film was utterly vulgar. The dialogue between Brit and Kato before there fight was obscene and pathetic - never so much in my life have i ever wanted the main character in a movie beat to a pulp. And yet he still won that fight. Brit was semi-likeable to start, but as the film progressed he became an eyesore. There were some redeeming qualities and characters in the film though. Kato's performance was pretty good - and Chebowski the villian was superb. I really had to stop and think why cameron diaz was in it though - her character, save one scene, was completely pointless and a waste of time. I dont know much about the previous green hornet radioshows/movies, but from what ive read it sounds like the performance he got in this film was very insultive to the series and to the Green hornet himself."

      "text": "Based on a comic book series and television show, this film tries to bring a more lighthearted approach to the superhero boom the film industry had experienced in recent years. Since I wasn't around when the Magna Carta was signed, I have no previous experience with this franchise before this film.  The producers try to aggregate the world of the original with a contemporary feel, and the result is a horrendous piece of work.  To keep a comedic tone, they cast Seth Rogen as the Green Hornet, whose ability to play the hero is comparable to achievement of the rest of the movie.  Never at any point did it feel comfortable watching him.  He brings the crude humor people know him for, which is ill timed and conceived throughout the film.  The highlight of the rest of the cast was the cameo of James Franco, whose 2 minutes in the film was the best scene.  Very little of the actions of the characters made sense and the flow of the story was extremely choppy.  Hence, it just never feels natural.  The one positive I can give it was the awesome car the Green Hornet had, \"Black Beauty\", which more a testament that they had good taste even back in the 40's. If the creator's of the franchise would be appalled by this rendition."

Seth Rogen was surprisingly good as Brit Reid/The Green Hornet. I love his comedy movies that he co-writes with his writing partner Evan Goldberg. Goldberg & Rogen perfectly add the right amount of action & comedy. Michel Gondry was the perfect choice to direct. Jay Chou shines as Kato. He steals the show with his charisma with U.S. acting debut. Christoph Waltz is good as the villian. Nice supporting cast. Good story. The action scenes were incredible. The scene with Kato vision was perfect due to Michel Gondry's genius mind. The film is perfect popcorn entertainment. The scenes with Brit & Kato are the best."

The fight between Brit and Kato was probably my favorite scene, and Christoph Waltz is very good in the villain role.  He's a genuine badass villain but he just doesn't know how to be intimidating, which gives him another dimension.  I didn't bother seeing it in 3D because, well, I hate 3D and want it to go away.

      "text": "To call this a travesty would be giving this movie too much credit.  As a devoted fan of the Green Hornet when I watch the original series in first run on TV, I was absolutely nauseated at the bastardization of the characters.  The Green Hornet/Britt Reid was conceived and developed as a savvy, intelligent newspaper genius.  Kato, his equal partner was intelligent, resourceful and fully equal with Britt Reid, though for the sake of their partnership he played the role of a household servant.  These were two men who had no preoccupation with how drunk one could get and how to or how often to climb into bed with someone.  The Green Hornet was not some egotistical weakling dependent upon someone else to think for him, fight for him or to carry him through conflict.  A brilliant tactian, a superb hand to hand combat artist in his own right, he an Kato where truly a team that formed a formidable nemisis to crime.  This movies portrays the Green Hornet and Kato as intellectually bumbling idiots saved only by Kato's tech ability, gadgets and accidentlly pulling off the right thing at the right time.  But, what was to be expected with Seth Rogan as the writer and the lead - exactly what we got; sophomoric hormone teen age party humor intermixed with gadgetry and CGI effects.  I hope that this film is remade with a serious actor in the lead role, with a real script and dialogue in line with the original character.  It's happened before (i.e. the idiotic TV \"Batman\" of the 60's redone into the the \"Dark Knight\" of today), we can only pray it happens again!"
