Surely an underrated Disney film and it deserves a bit more than that."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Meet The Robinsons is one of the Disney films from my childhood that kinda fell into obscurity. I remember when it first came out not being really interested in it but then one day I caught it on TV and it totally changed my mind. It is a great story with a lot of great messages for children and adults. The motto \"Keep Moving Forward\" is the obvious lesson to learn which of course means dont let the past hold you back and learn from failure. The other lessons are a bit less obvious. I wont go into them in this review since I think its up to the viewer to pick it up on their own. The one thing I think this movie has going against it is it looks like a cheap Pixar knock off. The animation at times can look cheap and when you realize it was made by Disney you are left wondering what happened. Overall the movie is fantastic and I highly recommend showing it to your kids"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "My gosh, I can't believe how severely underrated this movie has been! It is definitely one of the best kid's movies I've watched (and I've seen a few), and the only one that I watch regularly under my own steam."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "A generic, inoffensive attempt at Disney trying to make a Pixar film and failing. I can't imagine anybody, children or adults, having an overwhelming positive take on this because of how incredibly bland it is. The only funny part is in the trailer, and after having seen it so many damn times, it was exhausted seeing it in full context. Step it up, Disney."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Great manic fun with a beautiful visual style from William Joyce."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Rarely has any movie--any genre, animated or not--so completely, frustratingly, maddeningly self-destructed in so many different ways after such a promising, enjoyable start. Lewis, an orphaned child who grows up to be a pre-adolescent would-be inventor (with a hairstyle that's probably meant to evoke Back to the Future's Doc Brown but put me more uncomfortably in mind of There's Something About Mary) builds a portable time machine in hopes of visiting the past and discovering his real parentage...until his plans get interrupted by a slightly older boy from the future who needs his help and a stereotypical, Oil Can Harry-type villainous figure looking to throw several monkey wrenches into the works. This Disney-produced CGI film's early scenes--set in Lewis's orphanage and at his school's science fair--are fun, and feature several amusing characters: an overcaffeinated teacher, a dimly self-important coach (who wears the most potentially obscene pair of shorts ever seen in a G-rated feature) and the orphanage's appealingly levelheaded director (warmly voiced by Angela Bassett). Once the time travel begins, everything falls apart. The futuristic Robinson family that Lewis encounters in his adventure is apparently three parts the Sycamore clan from Frank Capra's You Can't Take It With You and two parts the Addams family; they (and this picture) suffer from the same malady that thoroughly wrecked Madagascar, Robots, Shark Tale, nearly every Simpsons episode of the last ten years and every Family Guy episode period--a willful lack of comic discipline on the part of the filmmakers and writers that allows them self-permitted carte blanche to throw every joke they came up with in script conferences (no matter how unfunny, tasteless or character-inappropriate), guaranteeing a singularly annoying moviegoing experience to be followed in three months by a DVD with no deleted scenes. Worst of all is this movie's astonishingly heartless climax, in which a peripheral character we care about is left out in the cold and the only plot element in which we had any emotional stake is cavalierly dismissed. The movie's theme, delivered with predictable sledgehammer subtlety, is to forget the past and look to the future--a philosophy the movie ascribes to Walt Disney himself--but all the brightly-colored if unimaginative design, 3-D gimmickry and the apparent eleventh-hour participation of Pixar genius John Lassiter in a futile attempt to patch this mess together doesn't change the fact that the kids in my audience (who spent a lot of Meet the Robinsons' running time chasing each other up and down the aisles and throwing popcorn) were far more interested in the vintage Mickey Mouse cartoon that preceded this. Roger Ebert once postulated that it's impossible to make a good movie that features a hot air balloon (and later admitted that he forgot The Wizard of Oz). Well, repeated viewings of It's A Wonderful Life, the Back to the Future movies, the Terminator films, Time After Time and (of course) the 1960 version of The Time Machine could convince many moviegoers that it's equally impossible to make a BAD film that features a time-travel device. No, it isn't."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "I'm a big fan of animation, (and the offspring of a long-time Disney employee), but I was especially disappointed by this film. The \"plastic\" (or plaster?) appearance of the characters was not at all charming, and the jokes were stunningly flat. I saw it on DVD, having missed the 3D theatrical release, and had to fight the urge to turn it off before it finished."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "An absolutely despicable waste of time and an insult to animated cinema, Meet the Robinsons is not funny or entertaining at all, and is easily one of the ten worst films I've ever seen. I only give it a 2 because it has nice CGI animation, other than that it's a horrible mess of monumental proportions. Another fantastic reason for why I have such difficulty liking these animated films."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "this is way better than Chicken Little"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "For a Disney film, I never felt so disappointed after seeing something like this. I mean Cars was a little bizarre and forgettable in my opinion, but this was worse. I saw this in theaters with my parents when it came out. I was around 16, and was thinking that maybe I'm getting too old for Disney. After I saw this, I never saw it again. The characters are forgettable, the dialogue was confusing that I don't think a kid would understand word their saying. The story I will admit is pretty creative, but it doesn't hold up and feels kinda bland even if its Disney. After I saw this, I was about to give up on Disney. This movie almost made me want to avoid the surprisingly greatest ones coming after it like Up, Wall-E, Tangled, Toy Story 3, and Brave. This almost killed my Disney spirit, and its so sad to believe that would ever happen."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "It's Not Bad ...But I Wouldn't Ask To See This Movie Again Or Buy The DVD Or Blu-Ray...

Trust me, you could be dishing your hard-earned dollars for sooooooo much less...

With strange characters like time-traveling dinosaurs and singing toads (annoying, but bearable), it's not too bad, but the main characters could have used alot of more development on them. It does have blandness in it with story and all, but you can sometimes feel some sympathy towards the main character, so thats okay. While it's tepid and all, kids will love it, but Disney fans would probably be annoyed how its Disney's third film in a row that fails to deliver much."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "'Meet the Robinsons' is as formulaic as it is quirky.

Sure, it looked cool, and I remembered trying to watch it once as a child, but I fell asleep during it (I was really young and it was late at night and all that), so seeing that it was on Netflix gave me the itch to give the film a shot and see what it had to offer, and sure enough, it was a solidly enjoyable flick! Charming and emotional with great characters and some decently inventive animation, \"Meet the Robinsons\" twists and turns in plenty of interesting ways and makes for some very fun family entertainment. Sure, you can tell this was one of Disney's first CGI ventures because the animation hasn't aged well in certain areas, and you can tell this was a film from Disney's post-Renaissance slump because there's definitely some pretty clich\u00e9 moments, but with so much humor and emotion, there's definitely a lot to love about \"Meet the Robinsons\" and it's definitely worth giving a shot."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Meet the Robinsons is extremely underrated.\rA very intriguing story intermixed with a very good message, Meet the Robinsons succeeds to be a fun loving kids movie."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Meet the Robinsons , it was almost good movie , excellent plot, touching the end but throughout most of the movie a bit boring , but the family of the future if it is pure imagination."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Meet the Robinsons is a delightful family sci-fi film, and one of Disney's strongest 2000's work.
