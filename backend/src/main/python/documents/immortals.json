The acting is poor, the plot is thin, dull and poorly executed and the script is the worst I have ever encountered in a profesional film. Even the films one the redeeming feature - the action - is often flat and dull. There are only two good things in this film.  The first is the action scenes involving the gods which are exciting, dramatic, fast moving and satisfyingly gory but far far too brief. The second is the performance of Mickey Rourke as the evil king Hyperion who is easily the best actor in the whole debacle. The main con is the acting ability of all the other actors which makes a plank of wood look like Laurence Olivier. Theseus is played by the typical good looking guy who clearly feels that muscles are a fitting substitute for performance and John Hurt, who is a generally a very good actor, is woefully misused. It is difficult to point out a single actor who acted in any way which didn't seem forced and unreal. However, this may not be their fault as the characters are given the depth of a thimble of water by the script and I imagine it must be hard to work well with a script that is so badly written that it would embarrass a ten year old. Several times, throughout some of the \"profound\" speeches the characters gave I actually got goosebumps, not because it was such a poweful use of the English language but, because it was so cheesy that it made my skin crawl. This similarly applies to the sex scene which was so completely random and seemed shoe-horned into the film just because every film should have romance. This brings me to the plot which was so predictable that you didn't need to be Nostradamus to stay 3 steps ahead of it. It really does seem like like the creator picked up \"Ancient Greece for Pre-School\" at a book sale, scavenged some names from it and mushed them all together rather than having any clue about what they are famous for (Eg: Since when was Theseus a bastard? and wasn't Hyperion actually a Titan himself?) but lets just skip over my gripes as to how the film was unrelated to Greek mythology in almost every way as to most readers that will be rather boring. The final nail in the coffin was that the battle scenes, with the exception of those previously mentioned, seemed rather unoriginal, flat, and, dare I say it, boring. Never have I been less interested in the clash of two great armies. Similarly the pre battles speeches had none of the badass attitude or brevity of \"Tonight We Dine In Hell\" and none of the epic grandeur of the speeches in Lord Of The Rings', instead they just sort of fizzled out in banal nonsense. If I, sat safely in my cinema seat, thought that the supposedly rousing speech was terrible and that the person giving it had the charisma of plague victim then how can we be honestly expected to believe that it could inspire men to charge into almost certain death? Quite simply this film was terrible and I would honestly encourage you not to waste your money and if you really must watch it then buy it cheaply from a bargain bin."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Whoever doesnt know or ever read greek mythology this movie has some action elements to be liked.But for those you know about greek mythology they will agree that this wasnt a  greek mythological fantasy action movie... it was an ancient greek tragedy.Faults of this movie are so many and obvious it made me laugh.

Olympian gods have become winners, and the losers became Titans, who were huddled in a cage with bars stuffed into their mouths, growling forever.\r Only a plump king, Hyperion plans to release the Titans, so he organized an army of heracliens wearing masks like those of executioners inspired by the medieval dungeons and torture rooms and go to seek his bow Epirus, a super- weapon of mass destruction which is able to reproduce the molecular beam arrows with balls of mass and strength, able to make holes through walls.\r And so begins the story of Theseus and the mother of the devotees who often go on to bisericuta.Tezeu was driven by lower Zeus, disguised as an old man catches him there ..... invasion, Theseus is cornered and his mother is killed in Hyperion his eyes by telling him he looks like hell.\rAnd as in any genre film, Theseus and his friends are enslaved, but with a oracles-virgin, escaping the clutches heraclienilor.\rOne of the deserting soldiers city, get to endure the ordeal that he suffered from Hyperion just to feel useful and he, kissing him in the ass.\r Zeus, meanwhile, tells the other gods that are not allowed to intervene.\rWe arrive at the scene where Theseus grab bow and kills the Minotaur .... actually a masked man, then the final battle will take place at Mount Tartarus.\rPhaedra, although a virgin oracle, **** easily with lightning first man who comes along.\rThe film is trying to tell you something, the idea of \u200b\u200bfree will, mature has several aftershocks, but a bit superficial forms.\rIronically, although immortal, in the final battle, all gods die.\r Overview: the effects are pretty good, but sepia, as in 300, it's too exaggerated, designed to make you feel on the thirteenth century.

Immortals has none of these. it is without a doubt the worst film that I have seen in many years. So bad that I have got off my lazy ass to sign up to this site to say just how bad it is...If you can only resist buying one thing that you really want this year then make damned certain that this is it!This film is a terrible waste of the material offered up by the original Greek mythology and could be a potential career killer for many of those unfortunate enough to be involved in it.The plot is a collection of ticks placed in boxes on a producers must have marketing list. Everything just happens because it must in order to fulfil this cliched criteria...Theseus must have a best friend, enter one cheesy Yankee(George Bush Jr could have done no worse in the role than this guy did) who with one terrible line of dialect becomes just that.The virgin Oracle soon becomes the ex-virgin Oracle after shedding her robes for a man she has only just met(Mr Producer picks up his pen and places a confident mark in the box for \"Intimate relationship and romance\"...).The sets range from bland brown rocky areas to more bland brown rocky areas with a couple of uninspiring and over used locals thrown in amongst these bland brown rocky areas. In 300 this was not an issue, they were holding one narrow pass against their foes for most of the film. In Immortals the whole of Greece has suffered an unfortunate makeover that would kill there tourist industry(and economy) overnight if it were real. Maybe the lead special effects designer has worked in the game industry, maybe on some post apocalyptic FPS as that is the grim vision of Greece that we are presented with here...The icing on this turd cake comes from the costume design, in particular that of the Gods. Camp shiny efforts for most of the film topped off by super camp yellow outfits for the finale.

The acting was average. The story was a bit boring: what ruined it the most (for me at least) was the romance between the protagonist and one of the main characters. I find that it was unnecessary. In this day and age, however, romance is a must, so I can't remove points there. Plenty of action scenes as the trailer suggested, except that most of them were dull, save for the one right at the end. The characters were flat: they were all either passive or aggressive, so all of them were quite extreme. I found the main villain rather engaging, but that's up to you to decide. The acting wasn't too shabby. The ending.. wasn't too good. All in all, a pretty regular movie, as expected from Hollywood these days."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "It's obvious that the filmakers behind this film were far more interested in the visual effects and the set pieces because somewhere along the way they forgot that they actually needed to tell a story here. The visuals are striking: the scenery is quite beautiful, the action well choreographed, even the acting was solid but everything else (everything that mattered) is just awful. The characters have absolutely no depth and lack chemistry; Henry Cavill is just required to look heroic and handsome because his character is pretty much the same as Sam Worthington's Perseus from Clash of the Titans. Titans may have been a bad film but at the least the plot was coherent enough unlike Immortals where the filmakers decide that they (needlessly) have to have Poseidon send a giant wave in to help the heroes fend off about 6 soldiers when Theseus himself killed at least that single handedly earlier in the film.

If you're looking for blood spatter in HD, this is your flick, but overall, the cardboard characters, imbecilic plot, and absurd;y self-important voices overs are just to bad to make this move enjoyable.

The only colourful person is Mickey Rourke, all other actors are just boring.And the design is simply annoying - the armor is made of plastic, the helmets of the gods are ridiculous, and you always feel that the movie has been completely made in a studio or designed by computer.OK, in the end the titans get sliced, smashed and choped in any possible way and here and there is some nice cruelty and a few naked breasts in 3D, but there are no memorable highlights. For example the scene before the final battle, where Theseus makes his speech to encourage the army. He just says some shallow blablabla and the people start grunting to hide he is only talking rubish. If you compare this to other blood, gore and iron movies like Braveheart, Gladiator or 300 this Theseus is just a plain schmock.I have to give it 5 points because my girlfriend insists - she liked the nude boys and one of the actors played in Twilight."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "It was decent nothing to special about it boring at times but terrible story telling a few scenes of true exciting action but I think 300 was way better in content and script writing."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "I'm giving this a ONE instead of a ZERO for the great casting for the gods and their costume designers, who did a terrific job making each one identifiable, and the set designers, who made the top of Mt.

Let's call this the poor man's 300.  Nothing about this was exceptional at all.  It started pretty solid, but faded as it went along.  There wasn't a single stand-out moment in this film for me.  The acting was mediocre, the characters were all very one dimensional (I didn't care for any of the characters) and poorly developed characters like the monk (yes he is literally just called \"the monk\") serve quite literally no purpose in this film.  Even the action, the true focus of the film wasn't up to scratch.  Apart from the battle with the gods (which looked awesome, but wasn't enough of it), none of the battles caught my eye.  Infact, there was one point in the film where I fell asleep momentarily due to sheer boredom, which has only ever happened to me in one other film (funnily enough, it was Clash of the Titans).  Nothing about this film is great or even good.  Literally everything is either \"meh\" or just plain bad.

This film reeks of average content, average scripting and (mostly) average acting. That's not to say it's bad, it's not not good in any real way. Certainly the action scenes (which we all are watching it for, lets face it) can be quite good, but those that are are unfulfilling in their length. A great deal has been said about Immortals comparison to 300, well of that film it falls far short, but the lineage of this bastard son is notable in the attempt at the slow motion visceral combat scenes. Yet somehow director Singh has managed to take all the slickness and clarity out of these scenes. In the predictable final battle, after a rather lacklustre pep-talk by main character Theseus, the melee is so confusion and the colours so drab that its very difficult to see exactly what is going on and whose doing what. Not that you'd care much; the characters of this film are all pretty mundane and without intrigue, popping off a couple of cliched lines occasionally and then dying appropriately as the drama demands. You have Theseus, the main protagonist who has a rather worrying relationship with his mother and that's about all there is to distinguish him. He blathers a bit about faith and the lack of faith (a running theme), but it's so irrelevant to the overall plot you can pretty much disregard it. There's Phaedra, the virgin oracle who doesn't remain so very long (here the film is similar to 300 in its gratuitous and pointless sex scene, although not as funny as 300). Then there's, for me, the one true highlight of the film, the \"evil\" king Hyperion, played by Mickey Rourke. Rourke is by far the strongest character of the film and I actually found myself rooting for him more and more; he had a game plan, set morals and didn't seem like a piece of wet tissue paper like a lot of the other characters. I genuinely hoped he would win in the end (he didn't, this is Hollywood after all). Another stronger point is the battle sequences of the gods, which are fast and viceral, though too short to be really satisfying. Watching what one of them splatter bad guy head with a hammer in slow motion was pretty fun. But tragically that's about it, the greek gods, who are dressed in bizarre garish gold costumes something akin to a French perfum advert, are pretty anonymous - the only way to tell Poseidon appart from Zeus is that he's holding a trident. I'm sore pressed to say who the other two gods were, possibly Apollo? Maybe Helios? Perhaps Whocares, god of weak character development? Athena, who is actually named, seems a bit of bimbo and quite pathetic, rather than the strong willed, stubborn goddess of wisdom and war she's meant to be. But, like all other characters in this film, even the gods are just there as padding until their dramatic deaths (I did tick the \"spoiler\" box). Of course only a Titan (whom Hyperion is attempting to free to bring about a new world order or something....) can do it. I bet they're massive! I hear you cry. Well no, they're not titanic, ahem, they're more like the savages from the Decent and plastered in grey mud, then they die like Hollywood vampires by crumbling into dust, much like my interest at this point. All that isn't bad, it's just not good, it's weak but its palatable. It's average but its not terrible. What's really bad about the film is little irritating stupidities that make no sense whatsoever. It might just be me, but Phaedra drinking from pool of water in the least efficient way possible (holding her hand vertically so that no water is actually retained) and then dribbling water from her own lips into Theseus' was just ridiculous. The misuse of actors like John Hurt who had so much more potential. The random sea of oil that has no function to the plot whatsoever. The knife wound that Theseus receives in the end but doesn't stop him - at least Maximus in Gladiator had the good grace to die after such a wound. The village that is undefendable despite the fact that its only obvious entrance is a narrow corridor cut into the stone of the cliffs themselves - as we all know, small narrow corridors are totally undefensible unless manned by half naked Greeks... oh wait. These things and others just pander to ridiculous pointless features that are there as padding for an empty film with barely enough strength of character to stand up on its own. I suspect the lifetime of this film is slightly less than its title puports.\r P.S. I really do wish Hyperion had won in the end, at least I felt like he had put the hard work in."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "Immortals is just another one of those, loud, noisy, thinly written, and overproduced movie that is just sloppily made and poorly acted.

The slo-mo highly stylized scenes of ultra-violence were done well, human obliteration looked more authentic than ever, and this is one of the film's elements I think worked well. My biggest disappointment was with the gods, they were played simply by normal humans with little to no special effects augmentation.

Note to self: if someone gives you a magic bow with unlimited ammo arrows? Hold it with both hands..."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Ok I watched this, and I had a good time.  Why?  Well...I'll be blunt...the murder ratio was up to par.  There is a lot of horrifying murder in this picture, and that's a good thing.  I wasn't trying to watch 'Steel Magnolias', feel me?  This movie had excessive splattery gore that just made my day. Legendary Pictures alrerady has a well-defined artistic look, and I respect that heaps. The villain (Mickey **** Rourke) is so dope in this, I wanted to cry.  He does pure, but disaffected, evil so well, it makes me just wanna get hammered with him somewhere.  He's the ****  The only thing that seemed out of place was the last scene, with a Bieber moptop and some Kanye West self-indulgent montag\u00c3\u00a9 ****  That was just dumb as hell...because it was pointless.  You guys already made a good movie.  Pouring **** on it isn't gonna help. See? Anyway, that was a misstep, but I still really liked it, & it's a good time........if you like murder. :}  I do."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "It's definitely cool looking, but sometimes that's just not good enough. The acting and the action scenes were both patchy, the plot was ridiculous to the point of unintentionally funny, the 3D was weirdly flat, and easily 2/3 of the scenes could have been cut without the movie losing anything. Though I had to add a point for Mickey Rourke, who was awesome."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "very very good moovie.Maybe better than the 300.I found this moovie very good from the first to the last second.The most interesting moovie of the year after Harry Potter."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Mickey Rourke (nobody plays a better antagonist) is enigmatically brilliant as Hyperion and Henry Cavill puts in his best performance since \"The Tudors.\""}, {"rating": "10", "text": "So happy to see Mickey Rourke having a resurgence and getting the big roles he deserves.  He should have won an Oscar for his role in The Wrestler but Hollywood politics got in the way and the award was instead given to Sean Penn because he is more \"politically correct\" by Tinseltown's twisted standards."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Sorry, but any movie with Mickey Rourke as the bad guy is worth the price of admission.  Just saw \"Angel Heart\" over Halloween and I forgot how awesome that film was."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This movie was epic. When i saw the trailer i thought it would be really stupid but i was definitely wrong. The acting was definitely not the best, but the action definitely was. Amazing and epic action scenes. My mind was blown. I loved this movie. If you liked 300 then definitely see this, but if not unless you like really well choreographed action, then this movie isnt for you. This movie requires a certain taste, but if you have that taste then you must see this. You wont be disappointed. 8/10"}], "recommendations": ["clash_of_the_titans", "transformers_the_last_knight", "pompeii", "underworld", "underworld_blood_wars", "battleship", "bloodshot", "hercules", "300_rise_of_an_empire", "ghost_rider_spirit_of_vengeance", "poseidon", "jumper", "teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles", "pacific_rim_uprising", "the_old_guard", "into_the_storm", "priest", "king_arthur_legend_of_the_sword", "sanctum", "the_legend_of_hercules", "infinite", "suicide_squad", "gemini_man", "xxx_return_of_xander_cage", "jonah_hex"]}
