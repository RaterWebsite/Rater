      "text": "This movie gets the lowest possible rating for its propagandistic depiction of Russia and its citizens.Non-US affiliated male Russians are portrayed as incompetent or cunning, calculating, cruel, corrupt, lacking sophistication etc., whereas their female counterparts are portrayed as victims (e.g. the scenes after Natasha and her sister are taken from their 'parents' being filmed in such a way as to evoke documentary footage of human trafficking and prostitution rings; the Widows being deprived of their reproductive organs by their male superiors.) And Russian prison wardens and inmates apparently do not merit rescue by our heroes after being buried underneath an avalanche.The film-makers want it both ways - we are to believe that Russia is a backward nation with second-rate technology (note the cumbersome Russian helicopter contrasted with the sleek American Quinjet), but also one that is extremely capable at causing international strife - due to the indoctrination of its citizens, the deprivation of their individuality and free will. A 'good' Russian is thus one that hopes to escape to Ohio ('The Land of the Free') or join an American superhero taskforce.To have all the Russian characters portrayed by Western actors is but another glaring example of the movie's dishonesty, but also helps us identify it as that which it ultimately is - propagandistic filmmaking. Black Widow exemplifies the considerable sway of the US military-entertainment complex, its ability to impose its geopolitical agenda on the MCU; but the obvious propaganda leaves the movie bereft of any artistic merit it may have otherwise possessed.I can but humbly suggest that viewers seek out Andrey Zvyagintsev's masterful 'Loveless' for its critical, unflinching portrayal of modern-day Russia.I'd like to add that 'feminism' and 'SJWs' aren't to blame for the movie's Russophobia. That so many users here believe this to be the case is quite worrisome, and imo proof of the efficacy of our politics of division. We should all wish (for the world) to be free of scapegoatism, oppression and double-standards."

      "text": "The post-pandemic era is among us, and two years after 'Spider-Man: Far from Home', we finally get our first Phase 4 MCU film in the form of 'Black Widow', a prequel film of sorts that takes place between the events of 'Captain America: Civil War' and 'Avengers: Infinity War', and sees Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff going up against the secretive Black Widow organization that raised her, along with the help of her family. As far as MCU entries go, I'm just gonna straight up say that this is pretty much middle of the road territory. The stakes never felt especially high and this felt more like just a fun filler entry. As far as performances go, Johansson delivers with great action and a headstrong performance, but for me it was Florence Pugh as her younger sister that stole the show. She had plenty of humorous comic relief moments and one-liners throughout and also got to shine in some great action sequences of her own. David Harbour and Rachel Weisz are also worth mentioning as their parents, who both deliver some great scenes and moments alongside each other. Overall though, the cast and action sequences make things enjoyable and worthwhile enough to make up for a generic and straightforward story, and there's certainly been weaker MCU entries. Stick around till the very end of the credits for that trademark MCU end-credits scene."

The only scene that really irked me was the 'fight' between the sisters when they first met again after many years, as adults. WTF was that about? That made NO sense.

I know a lot of us were worried that this movie wouldn't live up to our lofty expectations, but it absolutely exceeded them!Black Widow was amusing, intense, and entertaining. It possesses its own gritty distinctiveness while appearing to blend in well with the rest of the MCU. Scarlett Johansson then delivered an outstanding performance. It truly saddens me that this will be her final appearance on the big screen as Natasha Romanoff.\u00a0 As for\u00a0Florence Pugh, as Yelena, it\u00a0was just\u00a0chef's kiss. She gave her all to this charming character. I gonna love seeing Yelena more in the MCU. Not to mention Rachel Weisz and David Harbour. They were also fantastic on-screen, contributing to the family-like\u00a0dynamic with Scarlett and Florence.Overall, this is a film that everyone should see. It features an excellent soundtrack, CGI, and combat sequences. For the first time, I feel like I'm finally seeing a non-objectified portrayal of Natasha."

The action is over the top and bogged by cgi. All the villains are immediately forgettable. And the humor is a constant hit or miss. All said, this movie does have an emotional core with the family that sustains in scenes throughout. Dan Harmon and Florence Pugh act very well and bring a lot of charm in the movie. Would recommend but don't have high expectations for Marvel's long overdue solo film."

In fact, there's not much *in* the movie at all that anyone should be considered at fault for. The narrative is solidly constructed, with decently affecting emotionality and some engaging elements of moral intrigue layered throughout. The performances vary from generally convincing to downright scene-stealing, with Florence Pugh and David Harbour representing the film's two main standouts. Even the action and set pieces are enthrallingly well-put-together. So, tell me - where the hell was this movie five, even ten years ago? Why now? After what we already know happens to the central character in question, why have a solo outing *now*? Would have almost stung less if this movie were just downright bad. At least at that point the whole idea of a solo Black Widow movie would seem to have been a bust. But, no. This is actually solid in every department except the intangible ones. The meaning behind any of what you're seeing on screen is simply all over the place. It's a damn shame, but an entertaining one, to be sure."

For a viewer, who takes the amalgamated approach of MCU phase movies and Disney plus streaming series, this movie should have benefitted from an ideal placement during the phase 3 progress. A Captain Marvel movie predated its release. The action, humor and drama are scintillating enough to bring viewers to the edge of their seats. The characters are neatly done and stays as the USP throughout. The experience would have been even greater, if the last act wasn't riddled with messy sequences. That dragged the experience down for  my the movie, giving similar vibes like Iron Man 3 and Age of Ultron. A pass, otherwise. 6.75/10"

The end result: an incredible spy thriller that should have been released many, many years ago.  If it was released then, probably Scarlett Johansson would have second thoughts about leaving one of her signature roles. However, we literally have a new Widow to contend with: Florence Pugh. Wow...again, another great find by Feige and Co. Pugh has always been a great actress but sorry to say, I felt that she fit more like a glove in this universe in comparison to Johansson herself. I always felt that they always tried to fit Natasha to Scarlett's and not the other way around. Pugh on the other hand is literally born to play Yelena.  Great action sequences as usual, and after three great Disney+ series, I thought that the cinematic experience for the MCU is a goner. Not anymore.
