  "description": "Julian Michaels has designed the ultimate resort: VICE, where anything goes and the customers can play out their wildest fantasies with artificial inhabitants who look, think and feel like humans. When an artificial becomes self-aware and escapes, she finds herself caught in the crossfire between Julian's mercenaries and a cop who is hell-bent on shutting down Vice, and stopping the violence once and for all.",

      "text": "When Madsen get s a role he can actually do something with, regardless of how derivative it is he can do some solid work.  The film itself is a suitably doom-laden and noir styled burnt out cop movie but Madsen, who dedicated the film to his late friend Chris Penn invests Walker with a palatable bitterness and anger now that he is alone and cast adrift in a world of his own doing.  The film, to be sure is often checking off the boxes of cop movies before it but it has a surprising consistency in terms of the quality in its acting and writing that elevate the worn out genre material.  Keep your expectations realistic and you may be pleasantly surprised."
