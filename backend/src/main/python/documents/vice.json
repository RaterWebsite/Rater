When an artificial becomes self-aware and escapes, she finds herself caught in the crossfire between Julian's mercenaries and a cop who is hell-bent on shutting down Vice, and stopping the violence once and for all.", "releaseYear": "2015", "mpaaRating": "R", "imageUrl": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/cBwZIq1QFasmsC9Wi3HvyEljfYN.jpg", "categories": {"plot": 5.0, "acting": 7.0, "ending": 5.0, "soundtrack": 5.0, "cinematography": 5.0, "familyFriendly": 3.0, "funny": 5.0, "action": 5.0}, "reviews": [{"rating": "7", "text": "When Madsen get s a role he can actually do something with, regardless of how derivative it is he can do some solid work.  The film itself is a suitably doom-laden and noir styled burnt out cop movie but Madsen, who dedicated the film to his late friend Chris Penn invests Walker with a palatable bitterness and anger now that he is alone and cast adrift in a world of his own doing.  The film, to be sure is often checking off the boxes of cop movies before it but it has a surprising consistency in terms of the quality in its acting and writing that elevate the worn out genre material.  Keep your expectations realistic and you may be pleasantly surprised."}], "recommendations": ["money_monster", "inside_man", "the_score", "street_kings", "gangster_squad", "triple_9", "insomnia", "primal_fear", "body_of_lies", "old_henry", "copshop", "casino", "the_wolf_of_snow_hollow", "the_untouchables", "bone_tomahawk", "training_day", "lawless", "black_mass", "breach", "jack_ryan_shadow_recruit", "wall_street", "from_hell", "american_gangster", "broken_city", "hell_or_high_water"]}
