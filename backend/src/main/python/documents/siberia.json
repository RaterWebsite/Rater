      "text": "Disappointing very disappointing. To tell the truth I expected something much more complex, more interesting, more entertaining but in reality the film drags things a lot and the tremendous slowness that comes with its narrative affects the enjoyment because the story never immerses you.For those who compared it to John Wick or they think they're gonna see something similar to John Wick, forget it, nothing further from the truth."

      "text": "The movie has based on very intresting character \u2013 Lucas Hill \u2013 diamond expert. This man, on first sig look \u2013 has perfe tly evaluation of jewels, but has strange ethical , scale of value when comes to talk about wemen and Love. Here we see how he, at the beginig, heas fall in love with the charmy Katya, but in away, which you can call it passiv.   She makes first step, offering to him, she. gives him a ride with her car, she wears his hiden diamond in a candle. He does not gift her even a soup, little with aromas, instead he ask her what she whants, he can  take iniatiative , to  the man, to lead.\tVery strange thing happens, when he has been asked-pushed to swing his love-friend-Katya-with the one of the businessman. Volkov just for one bjob each. Which is an act of becoming brothers, mnow they are \u201dblood brothers\u201d . Their trust asre raised, they earn confidance, but on expense of love.\tThis act shows the moral, the character of Lucas \u2013 he can`t defend his lovegirls. He is down on the strean of river, he does not take any atction to move up. The giuilt is always on the Pyoter \u2013 the problems with diamond is bbecause of him, the whole movie.,Lucs run from responsilility, hopin that something will phappens. Indeedd he does not run, he is sinks, regardeess of the warning of Vinsens \u2013 the South African.\tTMetaforicly Lukas lookson the women like a beautifull, \u201cthe best you ever 3ee\u201d- diamonds. Katya \u2013 with taft charatucter , forward and beautifull,  \u201cunalterable\u201d  reminds him , associates , pull a string deep in the soul of Lucas Hill. Which. is already forgot what is love \u2013 he is only old firriend with his wife \u2013 they look squint away certain things. It is shown a little bit of their relation ship, but plenty to understand.-Lucas can`t get enough from his wife\tBut when he finds the love, he is timid , he keeps Katya professionally, like the same way, he does not sacriface anything for her. Can we exchange the love like a. diamond jewelyy \u2013 for a wile , let`s our partner try it and then return it to us ?\tThe women are not jewelas, but Lukes treats them as such, he cant fin. inner forces. to fight., to go out of the river that gooes to the waterfall-fateful. for him, He doesn`t go against even once, he doesn`t fight for what he whants\tOfcourse Keanu Reeves do this movie on purpose, he build the character of lucas Hill like an opposite of Jhon Wick \u2013 who kills and fight. even. for. the puppy. left by his belovveed wife. Jhon Wick has will, Lucas Hill does`nt have ome\tThe opposition of these two heroes, th two types of men is tryuly significant. Mr Reeves has proved., not once , that he is capable of self-deception in the mane of art and cinema playing roles of \u201cweak\u201dman \u2013 \u201cKnock, Knock\u201d, \u201dThe Whole Truth\u201d. It is amazing the range of the actor., he can be super hero \u2013 Neo , or to be manfailuure \u2013 in this movie. The question is : Are the viewers wants , are they accept him like a lozer. Because, as it is known, Keanu is one of the favorities of the crowd. People loves to wattch. him.; how he fights, struggle do stun real stunt work mmostly wwithout a. double.\tHere comes the geniius move of this man. You see \u2013 your. hero, beloved actor , is in a blind alley, he is pushed , but dan`t do anything. You begi  start to askyourself \u2013 why he does not run, why he does`nt. shoot them, why he doesn\u2019t. do anythin for God, Please! Now you think, what I want should would do , if I mm on his place. This is it , This is the point of . Keany and dhedirector- to put you on  the place of main hero \u2013 to feel with him . To feel that you want to fight for your love. What you gonna do, if you were on my pplace , ask Keany with this movie."

      "text": "The trailer made this actually look like a cheap Wick spinoff with enough action and thrills for a VOD film to keep Your attention.Every actual action shot in the trailer is really only 2 separate :30 total sequences in the beginning and in the end of this film. Instead it's Keanu in a more reserved and boring Wick persona venturing around a bleak Siberian environment of rich Russian mobsters and a very annoying sex crazed Russian woman that is unconvincing. The plot drags around and really is cliche as they come with stolen diamonds and blown mobster kingpin deals with utterly banal dialogue. The ending comes abruptly with no real conclusion and the film is over. While Keanu delivers his signature acting style that's servacable for the most part, there's really no reason to watch this. It's essentially John Wick on a depressing vacation without any action or excitement Obsessed with a Russian chick."

      "text": "That Reeves would agree to act in a soft-porn film is regrettable but I suppose it should have been expected since his latest endeavors are over the top violent and 'sex and violence' tend to run together. It wouldn't have been too bad if the sex acts had simply been implied, but they were so 'in your face' and frequent, that it turned a '2 1/2 star' movie into a '1'."

If you expect action - there is almost none. If you expect intriguing plot and all that, there is close to none of that too. Basically they seemed to sell it as a movie similar to John Wick and it is far far away from that."

The movie is about a professional married diamond trader which isn`t professional at all and a woman that even she learn that he is married and in a deep trouble keeps follow him and have sex with him. The pathetic ending is the cherry on top where the main character hid behind planks and it get protected by bullets, manage to kill almost all of attackers but not the last one...."

He is either in good movies or in complete crap. This one is absolute crap. Completely tasteless.Movie promotes completely unreasonable unfaithfulness, tries to romance something so completely filthy and pointless as a meaningless hookup. I am very disappointed. Also the movie is very stereotyped, hence just poor taste all around. Do not recommend to spend money on this.If you can watch it free you will still most likely feel like you have wasted an hour and a half of your life. You have been warned!"
