The first 2/3 of the movie were extremely funny, while the last 1/3 changed it's tone to action/adventure. It's a shame the end wasn't more satisfying, but it is still definitely worth seeing."

That's pretty much the only defining characteristic - the humor (though little there is) comes from the odd scenarios and the satires-of-satires-of-stereotypes characters. I guess that's kind of good, but you'll probably just say \"What?\" most of the time. But it's not that bad of a movie. It doesn't make people more stupider than they are now. But there are FAR better comedies out there.\r Plus, what's with the guy in diapers who shoves himself in a chicken? Weirrrd!"

      "text": "The only way to solve world hunger is if it happens free of cost and everyone gets as much as they want all the time. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is a movie that is about exploring this idea. The film follows Flint, a gifted scientist who uses his mind to come up with this idea. Although this movie mostly makes no sense and is not suitable for a mature audience, it does not pretend to do so. It is what it is. While writing this review I learnt this is a book adaptation which was originally published in 1978. So considering that I believe the author would have really liked this movie.Flint is a character who is all about creating weird, wacky things without caring about the consequences. It is very similar to a superhero comic I've been making, so I can very well understand how much thought goes into showing what all things the protagonist makes in order to make the audience believe the tall claim. The problem here is, however, it is never shown why he suddenly decided to make a machine that can create food. It was never established that the whole town has been eating his father's sardines, nor it has been shown that Flint was made to eat the sardines. It was only said that his father wants him to sell them. Also there was no problem of poverty on the island either, so none of that really mattered.Then there was the introduction of Sam Sparks, who was introduced as a journalist that really pretended to not look like a nerd. The character seemed annoying until it was told how she became the way she is. And honestly the transformation should not have happened. From what was established, her glasses were of near-sightedness, so she has hypermetropia and thus she should only wear glasses when she needs to read. Also the song \"Four eyes, four eyes, you need glasses to see!\" got embedded in my brain after watching this movie. It also comes to my mind whenever I play Brawlhalla.Seeing the food from the sky really makes me hungry. Many people ask if you were to live in a fictional world, which one you will choose. If I had to choose, I'd say this one. The food which gets thrown away can help me last a lifetime. This is the reason why the climax scene didn't scare me at all. I'd gladly die that way, if it meant not eating gruel for breakfast the way I have always been doing since the pandemic started. But then again, this is just my personal problem because of the situation we are all in right now. This is a part of the original story so I won't blame the movie for this.I'm not sure the original story had Flint and Sam blow their cheeks while kissing though, so I'd definitely call that out. Overall considering all the creative liberty that this movie took, this was the only thing I found annoying. Other than that I liked everything about this. The character of Baby Brent, the police officer, the mayor - everyone was very well done. It's a good thing this movie turned into a franchise, because of which we will be able to see these characters more in the future.Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is just what you'd want to watch if you have nothing better to do and want to spend some time with children. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and is an adaptation of a children's book, plus the animation is also pretty good so you will definitely not want to miss out this one if you're watching all the 3D animated movies of the current times. A definite watch from my recommendation."

It starts promisingly, and has some really nice effects, but at some point the plot takes a dive off a cliff. But maybe that's what the creators of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs were going for - an absolute rejection of the conventional fantasy animation. It's easily among the most surreal film experiences I've ever seen, and that has it's charm, up to a point. But it would be nice to have a bit more characterisation in the mix as well. Worth seeing if only for a jelly castle and spaghetti twisters being realised on screen."

      "text": "It is hard to realize how truly weird this movie is. If the plot remains overly simple from beginning to the end the execution totally lacks to be desired. It all feels so often confusing, repetitive and drafty.Characters are as shallow and uninteresting as the relation they all build together. Many of them can easily be synthetized in one dialogue line to identify how simple and non-nuanced their goals and purpose are. The villain appear to be overly stereotyped witout any decent reason. The romance is poorly written, with the classic 'love at first sight' followed by all the awkwardness you can imagine. Hero's family ties are boring and incomplete as they all focus on Flint's aspirations and struggles in life.If 'Cloudy with Chance of Meatballs' could have been a deep satire of the omnipresence of food, its unavoidable waste and its terrible overconsumption, it eventually falls far from it as it constantly develops effort to remain in a bizarre and dumb category. It is like if the directors didn't even realize they were tackling some major and potentially interesting issues in our societies! I would say it becomes weirder and weirder as we come closer to the end, in a way that the ending scenes take an unexplainable taste of surrealism.3D effects appear to be rather ugly from time to time. Music is as uninspired as generic. Humour almost always follows the main weirdo theme of the movie but sometimes manages to be surprisingly clever here and there. In the whole hometown we only focus on less than eight characters."

The theater I went to needs to upgrade or change their glasses because the lenses were getting a \"puckered\" wrinkled effect to them. Oh yeah, back to Meatballs. Like I said, they could make just about anything in Imax 3d and I'll see it and like it. So goes for this flick. Even though it made somewhat of an effort to be morally visceral, it failed. The relationship between Flint Lockwood and Dad just doesn''t work. James Caan's got about 6 lines in the whole movie. All the relationships weren't devolped much at all. Comedically, it's sporadically fun at best. Visually it's the bees knees. I really wish \"Half Blood Prince\" had more 3d in it."

      "text": "It could be a commercial for ice cream, the scene where the children of Swallow Falls first encounter the scoops that Flint Lockwood(Bill Hader) created for his temporary wonderland. Just like a real commercial, only skinny children fill the landscape, and interestingly enough, they never gorge on the ice cream like a real kid would. The mis-en-scene seems informed by advertising, in which food companies create television spots that hide the truth about their fatty products. The children play with the ice cream; they and Flint have a frozen food fight, but the socially inept inventor hits the kids too hard with the dessert balls. This action indirectly shows how a product like ice cream is bad for your health. Flint's rough play foregrounds the dishonesty behind adverts that peddle hamburgers, sugary drinks, or any other sort of junk food. It's like a rupture in the text, in which a commercial that elicits consumer interest through the association of its product with some pleasing image(such as an ice cream park), is subverted by a self-critique, like if Ronald McDonald suddenly pushed some kid off a swing. While all the townspeople keep their figures throughout the constant deluge of high-calorie food, the mayor(voiced by Bruce Campbell) is not quite so lucky. He's fat; he suggests the real end- result to Flint's invention. The food storm can be construed as being metaphorical of our country's obesity crisis, but the meaning is lost somewhere in the marinara, because the images are too preoccupied with spectacle for serious contemplation."

Yes, today, I saw Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, and no, it is not the kiddy film you may see it as. It has some great humor, top-notch animation, and good voice acting. If only it had a stronger theme and weren't so derivative. Cloudy is really a fuse of Surf's Up! type humor and Ratatouille style food. But it just misses greatness by a mark. Cloudy features a clever and inventive story, but I'll discuss cleverness in the next section. Why you ask? Because being funny and clever doesn't mean the movie has a good story. Lucky enough for this movie, the story has enough creativity to pass. The story is full of lovable characters, even if half of them have heads a tad too large. The story isn't sophisticated, but its not extremely simple neither. At least the kids will enjoy it. Story gets a 60%. Cleverness is really the \"meat\" of Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs. The humor is very funny at times, but at those unfunny times, annoying. The humor is about as equal to what you laughed at in Surf's Up!, which is relatively a good thing. Most of the humor is generated by pure randomness and good food jokes. Cleverness gets 80%. Cloudy's animation is not cloudy at all. In fact, it is almost at it's best. Crystal clear and beautiful looking. The detail is not sophisticated, but it is still fairly incredible. Animation gets 80%. I saw this movie in I-max, so I thought I should say something about the experience. Although it isn't like they said, you still get a good experience overall. In all the interviews, they say you were going to get meatballs and pies galore, in your face. But that just is not true. While it is worth seeing in I-max, Cloudy isn't exactly the best I-max experience out there. Although it technically does not count, because it does not ruin the movie, I give the I-max quality 60%. Cloudy features a rather varied and talented voice cast. Remember the guy from Hot Rod? Well he voices Flint Lockwood, the main protagonist. Anna Farris plays Sam, the love interest of Flint. And Mr. T plays the cop dude. They all do so great. Voice acting gets a 70%. The music in Cloudy is the only thing that is actually cloudy, which means.....it sucks. I mean, I didn't even want to stick around for the credits because the music isn't really original or catchy. So really, do you want the score in your soundtrack collection? Music gets 30%. Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs is overall a great movie, even if it doesn't quite overcome its obvious flaws. I think it is worth seeing in theaters, because it is obviously one of the better '09 films."

But I am not the intended audience of the film. Cloud With a Chance of Meatballs is a film made for children and as kids films go its ok it\u2019s only when you look at as a film do the cracks start to show. If you are a parent and looking for something charming and safe to so your children this is the film to show them. If you\u2019re not a child I\u2019d say you can afford to skip this one. Nothing bad in this but at the same time nothing spectacular just a cute little film that will keep kids entertained nothing more."
