      "text": "Truly original.I thought I had seen almost everything I could see in relation to Spider-Man, because he is one of those characters who insists on returning to the cinema with some regularity. To make matters worse, the industry, and particularly Marvel, flooded theaters with films about cartoon characters, from the most famous to the most obscure, and this became repetitive, trivializing the genre.But this film has nothing to do with the others. In fact, instead of following the path of ultra-realism that other animated films have followed or limited to being a spin-off or reissue of the character's story, the film transports us totally to the world of comic books, assuming for you that stylized look that these publications have, and bringing a totally new and different story, with an African American Spider-Man who tries to succeed the original, after witnessing his death, and save the world from destruction with the help of several versions of the hero from various parallel universes. Even the famous Spider Pig (even those who have never seen the Simpsons know) will appear!The film features several famous actors who give the voice to the various characters (Shameik Moore, Jake Johnson, Mahershala Ali, Hailee Steinfeld, Nicolas Cage etc.) and is visually impressive, full of effects taken from the comic books on paper and a CGI state-of-the-art. The sound is also impressive, both in the action scenes and in relation to the soundtrack, where Hip Hop and suburban rhythms predominate. The pace of the film is quite fast, with breathtaking scenes.I had little expectations when I went to see this film, but I have to admit that it is truly exceptional. However, it turns out to be so bold and so different from the ordinary that this can make it indigestible to some audiences."

That being said, Spider-Man: Into The Spider-verse has proven to me to be among the most memorable films of the last decade. It has this incredible sense of charm, humor, and whimsy in way Spider-Man hasn't been able to capture since Spider-Man 2 in 2004. What's more, this is the most well-animated film I have ever seen, seamless blending a smorgasbord of styles while maintaining a magnificent sense of stylistic cohesion so as to not allow the numerous styles to crowd one another out."

But as the trailer came in and the critics who had already have seen the movie have been so positive about the movie I thought, OK, let's give it a chance. And wow. I was so surprised: this is the best animated movie I have seen. There are parts of the settings where I was blown away by the visual ideas. The tone, the mood, the style. Everything was just mastrefull. The story was well structured, although the twist was not that hard to figure out. Still: worth see as it hits you a little bit emotionally.

      "text": "To be honest I didn't know what to expect from this movie it came from a studio that made amazing Spider Man films like SpiderMan 1 and 2. Then Sony made mediocre and almost bad films with The Amazing Spider-Man series and SpiderMan and Sony's animation films are hit and miss but some how they nailed it with this one.First off the visuals and animation were amazing at first I thought it would be jarring but that wasn't the case as usually films which try to do movies in comic book style usually fails...cough Hulk(2003)cough.but luckly this is an animation movie so it works brilliantly so well done Sony. The characters in this movie are also well fleshed out and contributed to the story significantly in one way or another.Miles Morales and Peter Parker and Spider-Gwen were the best characters and each were a delight to watch,funny and more. And shout out to (spiderman) the peter parker voice actor who usually acts in comedy did great voice work for Peter Parker and I can confirm is very different to what you see in love action films but really captures the feel of Spiderman.The movie was really bold as well from the different visuals the story involving parallel dimensions and universes which worked because you could see from glimpse that every universe felt different and unique.Also the film felt really mature even from a PG movie it felt like a hardcore PG film with its themes,drama and consequences especially the Kingpin charcter and a heartbreaking arc involving Peter Parker and I for one enjoyed that.The music was also nice.Miles Morales who the story is based on is a good lead from the voice acting and up. You could see the struggle he was dealing with trying be Spiderman and the responsibility of it and that's what Spidernan has always been about with great power comes.....you know the line.His character grows and develops over time as he dealt with the trails and tribulations of being Spiderman and by the end it payed off which was nice to see. The main Villain Kingpin had a compelling reason for his evil actions and has kind of intimidating a bit like like the Netflix Kingpin, which was a really mature take on a pg movie so agian another plus for the movie although there some generic bad guy things and dumb decisions that villians make in this movie but since its a kids movie i'll just let it slide.The other Spiderman people were really good too like Spiderman Noir, Spiderham and Pennie Parker were really entertaining with the screen time they were on though sometimes they felt have much variety sometimes compared too Spider Gwen,Peter Parket or Miles Morales.The action is pretty good as well and its done well with the comic book style animation as words or phrases would pop up on the screen like a comic book so that was fun and the comedy was really well timed and hasn't forced unlike the MCU movies it balanced the drama and humor aspect well in the movie.However my biggest gripe about the movie is that some character arcs weren't would fully resolved or plot holes per say especially for Miles Morales' Dad and his Uncle I cant go into details without spoiling but there was an issue that happened that semed it was forgotten about and never fully solved. Also just minor nitpicks is that you dont get to see Miles Morales be Spiderman for really long or really show off what he can do but I understand its an origin story so its understandable and sometimes the movie wanted to do some fourth wall breaking like Deadpool but only in minor moments which felt kind of out of place.So in the end there was very little wrong with this movie, I enjoyed almost every bit of it. It was funny, fun,colorful with really good animation,bold art style, amazing characters, blanced humor,great lessons about responsibility and courage and the drama was really well and was just an overall great movie. So again Well done Sony for making one of the best Spiderman movies ever and one of the best films of 2018."

It succeeds as both an art film and as a kid-friendly studio franchise film in unexpected ways. There are a few moments where the animation and story veer towards \"direct to video\" kiddie cash-grab territory, but overall this film accomplishes more than most big-budget live-action superhero franchise films even attempt."

      "text": "I came into this movie with larger-than-life EXPECTATIONS. After a horde of online praise from both critics and users alike, not to mention instant Oscar buzz, I was primed for disappointment as i thought a movie can never be that good.I was huge Spider Man fan, from the first Sam Raimi movie to the 2nd, and then it stopped there. I watched the third movie in the franchise (and had to re-watch it just to make sure I didn't see it on a bad day) and was just thoroughly confused. The Andrew Garfield movies were just awkward to me and I just gave up.This new movie however? BALL-BUSTERS!From the opening image referencing the Comics Code Authority (I promise that would be the last and only spoiler this will have!) I knew right then and there that this movie means business, the business of not taking itself too seriously.I had my doubts about having \"another\" Spider Man or any other Spider Man for that fact. I never was a fan of the early nineties story arc of cloned versions of Peter Parker. I thought this would be another way of today's media just pissing on already existing beloved IP like the way CW is doing to Superman in their Super Girl series. I was ready for Sony to just poop all over Spider Man, especially now that he's part of the MCU. More on this point later.We're introduced to Miles Morales, a brilliant kid from Brooklyn who just wants to make his own mark in the world and find his own special place, just like everyone of us. He is a character that all us can relate to with his constant struggle with the mundane. Even worse, being a teenager while he's at it.It is a totally down-to-earth story filled with everyday stories about growing up and handling expectations, until that is, he gets bitten by a radioactive spider. If you feel like that's a spoiler, where the hell have you been hiding the past few decades? It's every Spider Man's right of passage, get bit by a Spider, be Spider Man.He then gets thrust into a the bizarre world of being Spider Man and along the way realizes that it's not all fun and games and yes, indeed, with great power comes great... No I won't finish that sentence, Peter!Being a comic-book movie, the action is non-stop but what really sets it apart from a sea of such movies is the absolute grandeur of all it.The wonderful set-pieces beautifully drawn and rendered, will make you believe that this alternate universe of Brooklyn really does exist, and makes you wish you live there instead. It's captures Brooklyn's hipster and art culture beautifully, just that short of being artistic. Mind you not Blade Runner 2049 artistic, It wont give you headaches and make you think about the meaning of life or anything. Just wonderful.The best part, apart from the visual orgasm, is the soundtrack. It is never obtrusive and always on point. Lead by the promotional singe \"Sunflower\" by Post Malone and Swae Lee, the hip-hop and pop inspired score and soundtrack is absolutely blissful. Ever since the Black Panther soundtrack blew me away, I feel that i now love this music in EVERYTHING.This may be a super-hero movie but this is an offering I highly suggest the whole family watch. It has everything for everyone, with nostalgic (and I do mean NOSTALGIC) easter-eggs and shout-outs for even the snootiest of fans to references to the culture for today's youth. I give that an absolute perfect score. This is what a super-hero movie should be like. Hands down MY favorite movie of the year."

Unlike the previous Spider-Man movies, not only did Spider-Man receive an animated movie with a theatrical release for the first time but it also stars Miles Morales as Spider-Man instead of Peter Parker.Miles Morales (Moore) is a boarding school student, who admired Spider-Man as a hero. One day while hanging out with his uncle, Aaron Davis, in an abandoned subway, he was bitten by a radioactive spider which gives him similar abilities like Spider-Man. Later on, he discovers a secret laboratory where he witness notorious crime lord, Wilson Fisk/Kingpin (Schreiber), who is building a particle accelerator for some evil purpose and Spider-Man is trying to stop him.Although Spider-Man successfully disables the machine, Kingpin manages to kill him due to Spider-Man being wounded from the fight. With his death and identity exposed, the city mourns their beloved hero. Inspired by his death, Miles wants to fight crimes to honour him. He is then approach by what appears to be Peter Parker. Confused at first, Miles soon realise that this Peter Parker (Johnson) is actually from another universe where Miles does not exist and he is still Spider-Man but having trouble with his personal life.Both Peter and Miles learn that Kingpin\u2019s particle accelerator have brought him to Miles\u2019 universe. Peter reluctantly trains Miles to be Spider-Man while working together to stop Kingpin and brings Peter back to his universe using the same machine. They soon find out that Peter isn\u2019t the only one in Miles\u2019 universe as they are join by other Spider-Men from their respective universe including Gwen Stacy/Spider-Woman. Meanwhile, Kingpin is restoring his particle accelerator to use again for his upcoming plan.Although this movie is not made by Marvel Animation, the movie\u2019s animation done by Sony Pictures Animation is very good and very artistic which actually resemble the actual comic book. The story of using multiverse concept for the movie is well written and utilised without making it complicated or confusion.The decision of using Miles Morales as Spider-Man is pretty much a good choice in my book because he is lesser known superhero to most people and Peter Parker\u2019s Spider-Man have been very well known to everyone. This is a perfect opportunity for Miles Morales\u2019 Spider-Man to shine.The voice acting is very good and the casts are managed to deliver their best performances. There are many funny moments which I laughed so many times and those moments make the movie very fun and entertaining to watch. This could be the best Spider-Man movie I have seen so far. Stan Lee had a voice cameo in this movie posthumously which I won\u2019t spoil it here and you may not want to miss this movie. Having said this, I highly recommend you to watch this movie. Be sure to stay back for a post credits scene which could be a hint for future movies."

El dise\u00f1o de personajes estuvo excelente(exceptuando a los dos casos que mencionare al final) donde los colores llamativos y esas l\u00edneas de dise\u00f1o fluidas creaban un ambiente muy contempor\u00e1neo sobre todo con el atuendo de Morales donde esas Nike air force one luc\u00edan en toda su gloria con ese traje negro.Lo que no me acabo de convencer fue la implementaci\u00f3n de los dos personajes que no eran Spiderman, sobr\u00f3 un poco el spider pork, ya que si da risa pero tampoco es que sea un personaje muy memorable, que valga la pena recordar y con respecto al segundo personaje si lo se sony es japonesa pero no hab\u00eda la necesidad de implementar eso  o por lo menos no de una manera a lo Big Hero, se sinti\u00f3 algo antinatural a mi gusto.El apartado musical estaba presente con ese hip hop cuando deb\u00eda estar y en ning\u00fan momento se sinti\u00f3 que interfiriera con la experiencia as\u00ed que muy bien por ese lado.El cierre de trama fue espectacular, sin embargo se pudo haber explotado un poco mas el terreno de la familia de Kingpin donde hab\u00eda posibilidades para entender mejor a este personaje y sus motivaciones.El cameo de Stan Lee fue un lindo detalle adem\u00e1s de esas frases que salieron en el momento de crisis del personaje, ya que forman momentos genuinamente conmovedores sin caer en ridiculeces ni amor familiar inc\u00f3modo.Si bien hubo momentos donde sent\u00eda un poco lenta, casi en su totalidad pudo llamar mi atenci\u00f3n y la de la mayor\u00eda de la sala donde todos est\u00e1bamos expectantes de ver que suced\u00eda con nuestro \u201camigable vecino\u201d.En cuanto a m\u00ed me encanto esta versi\u00f3n, se siente como algo fresco para el cine de superh\u00e9roes donde no est\u00e1n grandes actores y presupuestos r\u00e9cord sino simplemente una historia interesante con una animaci\u00f3n de calidad. Deben ir obligatoriamente  a verla, lleven a sus hijos, sus hermanos, sus primos o sobrinos cr\u00e9anme que la disfrutaran y le alegraran el d\u00eda a alguien."

A \u2018Set-Up\u2019 Movie is a term that I often use to point out some cinematic garbage that milks money out of its production value just for the sake of setting up a big Cinematic Universe (that started all the way back in 2008 with Marvel Studios,precisely with Iron Man). Sony started this 4 Years Ago with The Amazing Spider-Man 2,a movie with some decency in its runtime,but still ruined by the likes of Alex Kurtzman\u2019s \u201cJJ Abrams Mystery Box\u201d style writing,but it was later taken to a new level by Universal Pictures (Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom or The Mummy with their 3rd Acts).Now Sony is still trying to start their own Universe as of 2018 with movies like Venom (\u201cWhen I get out of here...And I will...There\u2019s gonna be Carnage\u201d) and now Spider-Man Into The Spider-Verse,a movie that may be the best movie out of all these Set-Up Movies for the reasons it\u2019s not supposed to work (but somehow,it does).Literally everything about this movie is flawless. Yeah,sure,there are some jokes that didn\u2019t land as much as the previous one...Yeah,the Animation was interchangeable at times and yes,it has a soundtrack with classic hits (aside from Sunflower and What\u2019s Up Danger?) that feels perfect for a dumb YA Movie,but who cares? There\u2019s a real Entertainment value behind this movie,and it shows all its hard work put into this. It may also be the most Personal movie I\u2019ve ever seen,considering the fact that Miles Morales (the main character of the movie,played by Shameik Moore) is me,but black and Spider-Man.Difficult relationship with his dad? Check.Being in the wrong school because of the dad\u2019s reasons? Also Check.Always trying to save/help somebody out? Umm,hell yeah.This is my favourite Screenplay of the year for all these reasons and so much more,but also because it manages to combine all the previous Spider-Man outings (for example,the Raimi trilogy for its Origin story,the character getting beaten to the ground morally and\u2026.maybe too many villains?) and still trying to be a movie of its own,with new characters,frenetic action scenes (some of them brutal for a kids movie,where even Japanese media ain\u2019t got nothing,even if that means whatever the hell that was in Akira),brilliant character development (we get to care about a living pork,for Pete\u2019s sake) that is all accompained by fantastic animation. Sometimes it\u2019s a living comic-book,sometimes it\u2019s a Borderlands game,and sometimes a PS2 game (mainly for character animation),which keep in mind,makes sense for the world we\u2019re watching.Th screenplay also manages to get excited for its future Cinematic Universe (with a sequel and an all-female spin-off already in development). When\u2019s the last time you\u2019ve seen a non-MCU Movie that got you excited for its universe of future movies? As I said before,the Screenplay also manages to get brutal at times,with a punch by a big buff dude like Kingpin that feels like the Apocalypse and a gunshot that kills a character. Again,when\u2019s the last time you\u2019ve seen a brutal non-Pixar animated movie?It also doesn\u2019t stop to reference something classic for laughs and be Deadpool or LEGO Batman for a second,no no no,because the references are actually in favor of the story,whether it\u2019s a character introduction or a post-credit sequence.Oh,and the 3D is so good,it\u2019s honestly the best use of 3D since Avatar. Not even a second to be on screen and the colors pop out the screen on purpose,making this movie the best acid trip since 2001 A Space Odyssey. The Comic-Book effects leap as if we\u2019re seeing a literal comic-book,and the image sometimes feels worthy of a Best Cinematography award.Overall,there\u2019s really nothing to complain about in here. After walking out of the theater,I said to myself \u201cMan,this one will be hard to write because everything about it is really good\u201d,but no. I really had fun doing this. This is also the kind of guts a typical movie critic has. Usually,we enjoy talking TNTs about a bad movie,but sometimes,a good movie can feel like a new quest,a new journey in a movie critic\u2019s life,and I didn\u2019t think a Spider-Man movie would accomplish that (But again,this was a year where an Action Movie made me scream at an IMAX). I will come back at a new Sony Spider-Man movie full of hope,and luckily,with pure excitement. Please,go see this movie.It's really worth your time and pennies."

With stunning visuals and funny characters it is hard to be disappointed, it felt like reading a graphic novel front to back!The down fall is the plot. It is the best depiction of different universes I have ever seen but the story line is taken over by the visuals. Some of the characters felt mismatched (the anime girl with the robot) but in the end it came together.Most importantly, we need a spider man noir sequel!"

The trailer wasn't so clear about its animation, or the very bold storyline! When I went to see this movie I was blown away by the striking animation and the bold storytelling.. I think it's a very risky step for Sony to take, to make a very unique, new and comic-alike animation, I mean what if the audience didn't like it? It could have been a big disappointing movie, because it has an amazing story, I think this story is definitely the best story of the whole Spiderman movies, also the animation is amazing, it's flawless! When an animation movie brings the live-action movies down, it means that it's definitely unique and bold!!The story didn't take so long to get you into the main plot, it went with its surprising \"scene\" -I'm not gonna spoil anything in this review- and though it made a very good introduction of the characters, so the first act was very good, shocking and humorous too!The second act still a very funny and thrilling as the first act, introducing the rest of the characters, so it took more time to get us back to the main plot, and I loved it, because some characters wasn't that clear in the first act that I wanted to know more about, and others that I wanted more of their backstories because I liked them! After introducing the \"rest of the characters\" we get another shocking scene, driving us to another shocking scene.. excuse me if I'm mysterious about some stuff, but I don't want to spoil anything, and still, if you watched the movie, you're gonna understand me very well.The third act was very predictable though, but still very thrilling because of its amazing animation combined with the amazing action, and emotions... Oh yeah, the third act is completely emotional, and action-full!There're not any subplots like Fantastic Beasts the Crimes of Grindelwald or something, it's very straight and clear.. very good for kids, and amazing for Spider-man fans and adults as well.I think that Spider-Man Into the Spider-verse is the Spider-Man that we deserve as fans of Spider-Man and it's definitely the best Spider-Man movie of all the time.! And of course, Spider-Man Into the Spider-verse gets an A+!Alright, guys.. thank you as always for reading and supporting my work, and if you liked this you can click on my name above and read all of my reviews, lots of movie-reviews are coming ahead.. thanks again!"

There was a thought: \"When will it end?\"Sony, you are not there **** such a cool movie to do?I'm a child from Russia, so forgive me for the clumsy translation."

What is even more impressive is that it takes a new spin on the age-old Spiderman origin story. From a structural standpoint, this movie is the complete package. The animation style and character design are a aesthetically pleasing mix of vintage and digital. The script packs emotional punches and hilarious laughs. The voice acting cast is great. This is a rollercoaster of a movie that has no right being as good as it is. Easily one of the best animated pictures of 2018."

If I HAD to come up with something to complain about, it would be that Miles' personality gets a little too smug in places towards the end, but even that is really reaching. There's also one logic issue in the movie, but it's very minor. Other than that, it's perfect."

There was also an excellent music soundtrack that accompanied every scene of the movie, and I appreciated the hip hop influences on the music and the characters. The story was fun, although I thought that some of the characters were a bit superfluous. It also followed many of the superhero origin tropes, which I wasn't expecting based on some of the reviews calling this \"like nothing you've seen before\". Overall, very enjoyable and I look forward to a sequel."

      "text": "This movie was a huge - and pleasant - surprise, 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' isn't another live-action Spider-Man reboot from Sony, nor is it part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's well and truly its own story that focuses on the character of Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) and his pretty ordinary teenage life. Dealing with his father's moral ways because he's a cop, coping to get through school even though it's boring for him. Everything just gets routine for him, except for the one person he looks up to, his uncle Aaron Davis (Mahershala Ali) who gives him the right amount of confidence boost that he needs in his daily life. Miles also meets a young girl in his class, Gwen Stacey (Hailee Steinfeld), and she appreciates his wit and even odd - yet quirky - personality. One day, Miles stumbles across an incident that involves the evil Kingpin (Liev Schreiber) who has invented a device that can create portals from one universe crossing paths with another. A rift causes another Peter Parker (Jake Johnson) to slip through the vortex and enter the universe that Miles is in. Miles aspires to be just like Peter after he was also bitten by a radioactive spider, but Peter tells him that there is much to learn. It seems that Peter isn't the only one that crossed paths with Miles, as there are a handful of other \"Spider-People\" that somehow got lost into this universe too, from; Spider-Noir (Nicolas Cage), Spider-Gwen, Peni Parker (Kimiko Glenn) and Spider-Ham (John Mulany). They all team up to try and come up with a plan to get each of them home back to their own universes. The movie certainly is a breath of fresh air into a character we have seen in the movies so many times before. This may just seem like Sony - once again - trying to cash-in on the character, but thanks to a script by Phil Lord ('The LEGO Movie') and Rodney Rothman, it has heart and very self-aware humor that keeps it afloat. It acknowledges its silliness and embraces that, it's overstuffed but also is aware of that too. Most importantly, it captures the spirit of the Spider-Man character and the world (or 'worlds') that he inhabits. Sony has been desperately trying to adapt a Miles Morales story for years and years, and this is the best introduction for him, especially for people who may not be familiar with his story. The animation is eye-popping as well, making it feel like a comic book leaping off the pages. Overall, this movie is fun, fast-paced, touching and wildly funny. If you love Spider-Man, this might just be the movie you've been looking for since 'Spider-Man 2' (2004)."
