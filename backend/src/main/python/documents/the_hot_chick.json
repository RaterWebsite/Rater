  "description": "Not only is Jessica Spencer the most popular girl in school -- she is also the meanest. But things change for the attractive teen when a freak accident involving a cursed pair of earrings and a chance encounter at a gas station causes her to switch bodies with Clive, a sleazy crook. Jessica, in the form of the repulsive Clive, struggles to adjust to this radical alteration and sets out to get her own body back before the upcoming prom.",

      "text": "Have you seen the movie \u201cThe Hot Chick\u201d? Because I did and it is one of my favorite movies. In the movie, two characters switched bodies by ancient curse earrings. A young teenager named Jessica stole ancient earrings in a store that has a curse where if each person has one earring they will switch bodies. Jessica and Clive both had the earrings on. Jessica and a man who is a criminal named Clive swap bodies in the movie.They had no idea until they woke up the next morning. They were confused, shocked, and scared. The main character in this movie is basically Clive in Jessica\u2019s body the whole time. I feel like Rob Schneider the actor did a good job acting the role of Jessica\u2019s character.  Rob had to act like a girly girl the whole movie. Also, Jessica in Clive\u2019s body was trying to tell April that she\u2019s Jessica but April wouldn\u2019t believe her. April thought it was just an old crazy man trying to kidnap her. Then, Jessica\u2019s friends were trying to find Jessica to take the curse away and to get Jessica\u2019s body back. Jessica\u2019s boyfriend Billy was depressed because he felt like Jessica stopped loving him and he also missed her. Jessica in Clive\u2019s body was trying to tell him that he is Jessica but Billy wouldn\u2019t believe it. I think Billy also thought he was an old crazy man and doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. But in the whole movie Billy thought he was crazy. I like this movie because there were really funny scenes. My favorite part is the pillow fight, because they were hitting each other aggressively and getting hurt and it was entertaining to watch. The lessons I learned from this movie is be kind and don\u2019t judge others or you will get bad karma like what happened to Jessica and Clive. I think others will learn the same lessons like mine. The type of group of people that would like this movie is teenagers and LGBT communities. I would recommend it to them to watch it, because you can relate to it and it has a lot of funny parts. I would not recommend it to adults or kids. For example, kids will find it weird and not funny because they won\u2019t understand. For adults they would find it really immature.  The MPAA of the movie is PG-13. If I remake this movie I would name it \u201cThe Bad Karma\u201d because I feel like it makes sense. This movie is really good because you can watch it for fun or with your friends. I give this movie 5 stars for only certain people."

      "text": "There are so many things wrong with this movie. First off the plot was horrible. A male criminal switches bodies with a female high school student. This is a movie for high school and college kids with very low attention spans. There where only a couple parts that where funny everything else seemed like it was trying to hard. The girls in this movie are popular just like in all teen movies, but this is no Easy A or Mean Girls. So please stop making these types of movies Rob Schneider and stick to doing cameos in Adam Sandler movies. ."

      "text": "This is my favorite Rob Schneider movie. I know that's not saying much but I just happen to love this in. Even though I know it's kinda awful. It centers on a young woman played by Rachel McAdams ( Notebook) who steals a set of cursed earrings and ends up switching bodies with a petty criminal. When she awakes as Schneider she reaches out to her disbelieving best friend played by a hilarious Anna Farris (Scary Movie) and they try and discover how to solve it with a group of misfits all the while dodging her hot boyfriend played by a smoking Matthew Lawrence. It's hilarious and overly silly and although most of the humor is in bad taste this is one of those rare times that it just works.Budget: $34MBox Office: $54.6M8/10"
