David is at first amused to discover that Emily has created an imaginary friend named 'Charlie', but it isn't long before 'Charlie' develops a sinister and violent side, and as David struggles with his daughter's growing emotional problems, he comes to the frightening realisation that 'Charlie' isn't just a figment of Emily's imagination.",

      "text": "This film is one of my earliest horror movie memories. The first time I saw this movie was when I was in my second year of high school - which was in 2009. It was on TV, I was scared **** I loved it. I remember trying to explain the plot to my best friend on the way to school the next day without giving the twist away, but she didn't understand one word of my explaination, so the day after we made her mom rent this movie at our library and watched it at her house. Today is the first time I've seen it since. It definitely isn't as scary as the first time around when you know the twist, and it also helps to not be 13 years old anymore, but it still holds up for me because I have such strong memories of those two times I watched this. The rating is 100% based on that teenage sentiment, because this is not a 5 star movie, but isn't that kind of the point of movies, too?"

This was done as a security measure as so people wouldn't be able to reveal the ending. To further ensure the safety of protecting the film's ending, security guards would hand-deliver the reel to theaters showing the film. Fox had individually numbered each reel, as well as a final security measure. Fox Executive Vice President and Sales Manager Richard Myerson stated it was \"to ensure everyone's enjoyment of the film and to prevent 'spoilers', we've instituted extraordinary measures.

I loved it and the ride was so intense I thought I'd burst at the end of the movie. I never saw it coming, never predicted who or what Charlie was about--and was shocked. I LOVE IT! I love it when a movie sneaks up on me.Its great and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who wants a good psychological thriller. Dakota Fanning was wonderful and shows great promise as an awesome actress. What can I saw about DeNiro--he delivers in spades (?) and never lets you down. I found myself gripping my fianc\u00e9 at times and almost burying my head when I knew something scary was about to happen. I would have never predicted what the truth was and it was right there all the time. I loved this movie, will see it again, and buy it when its out on DVD. What a great and awesome piece of work. I am so glad I went. Go, you won't regret it. Oh and in case you don't know about the ending. The little girl was letting us know SHE HAS ANOTHER PERSONALITY. Just like daddy had Charlie, she too, has another personality! Prepare ye for part 2. Lorrie"

But the child starts talking about an invisible friend who seems increasingly violent and cruel. Robert De Niro takes the lead role and, contrary to many people's thoughts, I don't think he's too old for such roles. He has acted in a restrained and sweet manner, tempered with psychological depth, which shows us De Niro's versatility and his suitability for a wide range of characters, not just the tough mafia bosses who have made him famous. Dakota Fanning was very well too, far from the absolutely annoying performance she'd given us in \"War of Worlds\" (in which she just screamed constantly as she was dragged across the set). The suspense is built gradually, convincingly and pleasantly. I noticed that some parts are very easy to anticipate and, from a certain point, it doesn't invest in the thickening of the plot, but besides these defects, its a film that fulfills what promises and entertains the public quite well without, however, being brilliant. Worth watching, even if we forget it quickly."

      "text": "Little Dakota Fanning has got to be not only the most well-adjusted child actress in Hollywood history, but the most emotionally healthy and stable youngster in America PERIOD. Not only did she spend 90% of her screen time in War of the Worlds screaming at and running from Martians, but earlier this year was dealing with parental death, psychotic imaginary playmates and 87 other varieties of childhood trauma (to say nothing of having to look and dress like The Addams Family's Wednesday, only with brown sweaters instead of black dresses) in this derivative, mean-spirited horror movie frrom the director of Swimfan. (I'm sure Orson Welles never had a #1 box office weekend as a director, but this hack gets two different ones. Is there no justice in this world or what?) The usual array of pseudo-ominous tracking shots and cheeseball false alarms is made even more predictable by the fact that two of Robert DeNiro's lovely, talented costars, Elisabeth Shue and Amy Irving, are former Oscar nominees who've clearly seen better days, which gives you an idea of the thanklessness of their roles AND the relative length of their screen time. (Melissa Leo, of TV's acclaimed Homicide: Life on the Streets, also turns up, giving a performance that's both creepy and touching...and way too good for this.) Chances are you'll alternate yor viewing time between exclamations of \"Man, those filmmakers are sick puppies!\" and \"Just how stupid do they think we are?\" A couple of rather original jolts (such as Dakota's flip-movie book) make this vaguely better than DeNiro's last horror outing, the rock-bottom Godsend...but that's like saying that sawing your thumb and forefinger off in a workshop accident is preferable to losing your whole hand. And by the way, remember when DeNiro's appearance in a non-Scorsese film was a virtual guarantee that you were STILL going to see something terrific--be it an ambitious epic like The Mission, a guest turn in The Untouchables or even a purely commercial action-comedy like Midnight Run? The (hopefully not) late, lamented IFC game show Ultimate Film fanatic had a trivia category last year entitled \"DeNiro: The Sellout Years\"; if the writers of that category had known at the time of this and Godsend, they might well have altered the title to \"DeNiro: The Whorehouse Years\"!"
