If you enjoyed John Wick 1 and 2, well this is a no brainer. Definitely the best action film to see in a while although I hope they finally end it with the fourth film. It's a quadrilogy!

The movie starts with a action scene right away, because the movie picks up right after Johns excommunicado from previous movie due to him killing someone in the continental ground.The underline plot of the movie is basically John looking for the \"Elder\" to get everyone to stop trying to kill him and the the other plot that is going the same time is that someone sent by the High-Table to kill everyone who was involved with the mess that John made. But this plot point is thrown under the boss on the last 3rd. Halle Berry was in the movie for some reason, but she wasn't bad the action scene with her was quite good.But what falls face first is the last 3rd of the movie, which is located in New York's Continental where the High-Table has sent assassins and a small army who have \"Plot armor\" on which both blocks bullets and doesn't, but what was truly terrible was the assassin fights.They dragged on and on, to the point of I got bored, while it was amazing but when it took so long and then right away next assassin fight started I got frustrated.

The story doesn't bring much to the characters. If anything, it is kind of a loop that brings you to the start. The acting was pretty good. I really like the H. Berry scenes. There are smalls moments of pure fun in the movie. The action is precise, violent and very intense. The film doesn't take itself too seriously and it shows this time around. I give it a 80%.

Here are the negatives. Some lines of dialogue feel kind of weird. Asia Kate Dillon\u2019s performance felt really wooden and she never showed a lot of emotion. There are sequences where John Wick and another character are talking and all of a sudden they start talking in a different language and then switch back to English. It does start to get annoying. My last problem would be that I think Halle Berry was way underused. Here are the positives. Keanu Reeves does a fantastic job. He has done an outstanding job in each of these films but he did a lot better in this one. Laurence Fishburne and Halle Berry also do a fantastic job. The rest of the supporting cast does a great job. The standout for all the John Wick movies is the action. It\u2019s no different here. The action is awesome. It\u2019s hard to believe that Keanu Reeves is actually doing all of these stunts. The John Wick movies are basically 2 hours of dumb fun action. Each fight scene has some sort of unique flare to it that makes the scene interesting to watch. The cinematography is pretty good in this film also. Each action scene is shot differently and it makes those scenes ten times cooler. There is a cool long take action scene on a bridge. The score for the film is good. It\u2019s not outstanding, it\u2019s just good. The story is interesting also. We get to learn a lot more about where John Wick learned to fight and it\u2019s very interesting. There are a couple of jokes that did manage to get a chuckle or two out of me. The locations used in this film are really cool such as Casablanca and New York City. It\u2019s good to see these different environments in this film. The film is paced really well and the tone remains consistent most of the time. Before you see this film, you must watch the first two John Wick films or you will be confused. Overall, John Wick Chapter 3 - Parabellum provides more hard hitting action with great acting and solid worldbuilding. I give John Wick Chapter 3 - Parabellum an 8/10."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The movie has plenty of action but it doesn't seem like much is happening except for wick fighting some guys."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "An excellent addition to one of my favorite action franchises. It has very fast-paced action, but also contains interesting themes that make the viewer think. My only issue is that the style of the films is starting to get a bit repetitive, however, it is a system that still works. Overall, it's a great film that I'd definitely recommend."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Once again the John Wick series keeps its momentum and manages to produce a third quality movie in its franchise. After the first two movies I thought the action sequences couldn't get better but once again they prove me wrong and show more amazing continuous shots of all out brutal action. The story once again takes more of a back seat to the general high impact action of the movie however I don't believe you're watching this series of films for the plot more so the camera work and action shots, so whilst some stronger narrative may aid the film I don't at all think it is needed as the quality story present generally aids the outstanding action sequences."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Very rarely will the third chapter of a film franchise garner the best rating on IMDB or any other aggregate movie review website, for that matter. As far as film franchises go, most tend to drop off and just become cash cows that are created for the sake of making loads of money. The Transformers and Terminator franchises are a perfect example of this. Then there is John Wick: Chapter 3 and it has quite simply, broken all of the aforementioned rules and may have set a new standard. The plot is effectively laid out for you in the first ninety seconds of the movie. John Wick is excommunicated, and there's a $14m bounty on his head. Following that brief bit of exposition are two hours of endlessly entertaining action, and while the film does keep you engrossed with its sense of mystery and intrigue surrounding this world of allegiances and deception, it's the thrill of the chase that ultimately matters.Parabellum maintains a rather cutthroat pace throughout, right from the frantic opening half hour through to the brutality of the final act. There's a lot more humor on show in this installment, which works due to how ludicrous some of the action has now become.If you want depth, character development, and story-telling then go watch The Godfather. In a grade A action film, the pacing is more important than depth, the choreography is more important than character development and the story is only used to get the hero from one set-piece to the next. Parabellum is absolutely relentless in that it's ridiculous in the best ways while being loud and violent from start to finish. Chapter 3 feels like a celebration of the action genre, showing no franchise fatigue and referencing a number of great action films in the process, even a nod to the original action man, Buster Keaton, graces the film in its opening moments. The first two films delivered hard-hitting action but Parabellum takes it to a whole new level for the franchise, with books, horses and dogs playing a major part in doing so.Suspend your disbelief and strap yourself in because John Wick is back in spectacular fashion. Over the course of three films, he's earned his place in the action hero hall of fame in a franchise that should be regarded as one of the greatest within the action genre."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Solid entry to Wick franchise, tons of excellent action sequences with Keanu still cool as Wick.

This time, Keanu Reeves is back with a $14 million bounty on his life, which brings a continuous stream of assassins trying to collect (and some silly business about the High Table). It continues with the absurdly high-body count and Reeves\u2019 flat delivery, but seeks even additional ways to reek violence. Some of the scenes succeed (the dogs, horses and motorcycles), but almost every fight seems to go on longer than necessary. As a result, some of the stunts seem repetitive. Like previous incarnations, there are some snazzy locations. This non-stop rampage of killing features lots of well-staged action, which will satisfy Wick fans."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "The look and sound of the movie is excellent.  I watched it in 4K.  In some of the action sequences you can't help but laugh out loud at the ludicrousness.  The action is over the top, and even though he is WAY outnumbered by the opponents in every fight scene (especially the Halle Berry fight sequence with dogs), there somehow only seems to be a couple of people at a time that fight him, but the fight sequences are all about the choreography and will have you scratching your head about \"how did they do that?\"  If you cannot stand gore, do not watch a John Wick film.

Life is suffering.\".( 81/100 ).Hay muchas fortalezas en el universo que se est\u00e1 construyendo alrededor del nombre de John Wick, y aunque su ejercicio narrativo est\u00e1 absorbido por su acci\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n sorprende el hecho de que se logra construir un camino con golpes y peleas m\u00e1s que con palabras y \"complejos\" discursos.En este cap\u00edtulo, el p\u00fablico continuar\u00e1 como testigo del recorrido que John Wick realiza en busca de su libertad. \u00c9sta vez, \u00e9l est\u00e1 dispuesto a ir hasta la punta del iceberg para negociar su salida de aquella red de sociedades b\u00e9licas y dedicadas al crimen organizado.Parabellum tiene lo suficiente para entretener y emocionar a un p\u00fablico amplio: Las secuencias de acci\u00f3n son ingeniosas, creativas y, varias veces, hipnotizantes, los di\u00e1logos est\u00e1n adecuadamente decorados con frases po\u00e9ticas sobre el dolor y la gloria, la fotograf\u00eda y la escenograf\u00eda son dif\u00edciles de ignorar por su atractivo e impacto; tanto Keanu Reeves como Halle Berry demuestran una qu\u00edmica y una chispa de energ\u00eda incre\u00edble y, lo m\u00e1s importante, se nos permite descubrir m\u00e1s sociedades, artefactos y personajes que incrementan la intriga en el recorrido. Sin embargo, aunque la intriga crece, toda esa informaci\u00f3n no complementa la comprensi\u00f3n de dicho universo. Hay situaciones de alta importancia que se tratan de forma muy espor\u00e1dica y situaciones \"poco\" importantes que toman \"mucho\" tiempo en resolverse. S\u00ed, el enfoque de esta saga de acci\u00f3n es construir situaciones de alto impacto visual con coreograf\u00edas realistas y que fluyan t\u00e9cnicamente, pero, aunque sabemos que Wick quiere sobrevivir porque est\u00e1 siendo cazado, la pel\u00edcula incrementar\u00eda el valor de su historia si tan solo explicara por quien y por qu\u00e9.-There are many strengths in this universe being built around the name of John Wick, and even though the narrative exercise it's absorbed by its action, it's surprising the fact that the film achieves to build its way with punches and fights more than with words and \"complex\" speeches.In this chapter, the public will continue as witnesses of John Wick and his road to freedom. This time he is willing to go to the tip of the ice-berg to negotiate his exit of that warlike society dedicated to organized crime.Parabellum has enough to entertain and excite a wide public: The action sequences are clever, creative and, several times, hypnotizing; the dialogs are accurately decorated with poetic phrases about pain and glory; the photography and scenery are hard to ignore because of its attractiveness and impact; both Keanu Reeves and Halle Berry shows an incredible chemistry and a sparkle of energy, and, the most important, the intrigue in the story is increased by the introduction of more societies, artifacts, and characters. Nevertheless, even if the intrigue increases, all that information doesn't complement the understanding of that same universe. There are topics of high relevance with a sporadic treatment and situations of \"little\" importance that take \"a lot\" of time to resolve. Yes, the focus of this saga is to build high visual impact situations with realistic choreographies and technical flow, but even if we know that Wick wants to survive because he is being hunted, the film would increase the value of its narrative if it just would explain by who and why."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "John Wick Chapter 3 only expands upon everything that made the first two great. First, the action. A lot more variety and creativity in the fights, such as the use of knives and interaction with the environment. The action itself is smooth and has a special feel or realism in it that we've seen before. There is some more humor in this one and it's all very well timed with what's happening. Keanu Reeves does his thing and there is nothing else to say other than he's a man of focus, dedication, and sheer will. The movie also goes deeper into the world of John Wick and the assassins and we meet some new faces who are well established in their position.

Parabellum doesn't even have a plot of its own: it's completely reliant on its predecessor. This really didn't bother me at all \u0640\u0640\u0640\u0640\u0640 at first.The way this one picks up only moments from where Chapter 2 ended is just unbelievably great. I really couldn't have hoped, or imagined, for anything better. We get to be fully immersed into the fictional, and almost dystopian, crime world in a way that reminded me somehow of Blade Runner.The action sequences are stylish, insanely brilliantly choreographed and, most importantly, have innovative ideas and execution. John Wick franchise no longer sets the bar high for other action films; it sets up new standards for how action sequences should be shot and choreographed.Story-wise, though, this installment really disappointed me. As I mentioned above, all I asked for is an interesting story, be it a mere continuation of the last film or not. Unfortunately, the story here lacks everything that can make it intriguing. It's simply continuation to Chapter 2's with a rehash of storylines we saw thousand times in other action films to fill in the gaps. Moreover, Halle Berry's Sofia is almost an unnecessary addition to the film. I said almost because her dogs partly redeemed the presence of such useless, and even problematic, character.Drama is definitely not what I expected to see; but with all the silliness in the original and its first sequel, I was, somehow, \u0640\u0640\u0640 unlike here \u0640\u0640\u0640 emotionally invested in the goings-on and concerned, somehow, about the protagonist. That said, Keanu Reeves is absolutely fantastic as ever. He never gives us let us think of his John Wick as the formidable and invincible hero, even if we are one hundred percent sure he would win at the end of the day.All in all, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is a decent sequel that proves another excellent entry in the franchise, by further expanding upon this exceptional universe and taking even more risks regarding the action scenes and fight choreography.(8/10)"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "John Wick 3 tem tudo que um filme de a\u00e7\u00e3o deveria ter, no minimo.
