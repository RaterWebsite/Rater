      "text": "Monty Python and the Holy Grail is considered to be one of the greatest comedies of all time, and for a good reason.This low-budget film didn't just age well, but it sounds like it has been released 10 or maybe even 8 years ago, except it really makes you laugh out loud. This is how irony should be used, this is how breaking-the-fourth-wall should be done, and this is a Self-reflexive film that keeps being inventive and challenging throughout its running time.While its sharpness has been considerably blunted at some times, I was intrigued and hooked at every second of the movie.I didn't find the ending was rushed, rather I found it reasonably funny, if not completely satisfying. I'm really surprised at how Terry Gilliam take advantage of almost every silly situation or gag to reuse it later in the movie. He's a real genius!Simply, Monty Python and the Holy Grail is the godfather of parody films!(8.5/10)"

The plot tends to remain fairly strong and full of humor while the acting is just plain superb. These guys nailed the acting and it creates a laugh-out-loud good time. The only glaring oddity with The Holy Grail is the story. The plot is great and all but they are searching for the Holy Grail but then I don't quite what happened to that quest but that is insignificant when compared to the rest of the package. Overall, Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a great movie that is a must-see for it will entertain you for years to come as well as change the way you look at comedy, it is the master of slapstick. My actual score: Presentation: 10, Plot: 9.5, Acting: 10, Script: 10, Lasting Appeal: 10. Overall Score for Monty Python and The Holy Grail: 9.8 out of 10 \"Amazing\""

The film is tough to make heads or tails of, due to its sheer randomness and irreverence is really, really, funny. The acting, as always with the group, is solid but certainly not the focus. Instead, the acid-influenced and weird happenings to be found in the writing, as well as the constant visual gags and subtle jokes, off-set by the more straightforward ones, are phenomenal. The film is very well-written and knows what it does well and keeps the jokes coming throughout the film. Overall, King Arthur's quest for the Holy Grail is a riot."

If you are a Monty Python fan then you should definitely love this movie. There are so many scenes in this movie that have become pop culture references appearing in video games and other places. The first time I saw this movie I laughed till it hurt at many of the ridiculous things that happen in this movie. I own it and still really enjoy watching it today.

A lot of it entered pop culture history as \u201cthe holy hand grenade\u201d, \u201cthe battle with the black knight\u201d or \u201cthe coconuts\u201d. Like the title suggest it is the search for the holy grail by King Arthur and his knights. Of cause it is the Monty Python version with parody, satire, black humor and it is hilariously funny. I should warn you that the style of humor is not for everyone (but it is not the modern interpretation that it is **** However for me and my circle of friends it is an all time classic. We rewatch it from time to time and still enjoy it which became our definition for a \u201ctimeless classic\u201d. The Monty Python team consisting of Graham Chapman, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, Eric Idle, John Cleese and Michael Palin directed, wrote and played most roles. This made it certain that they got their unique style right. As side note: Some say the movie is a bit episodic especially in the first half which is not wrong. Because they got not everything funded they had to film in stages. Also a lot of famous people sponsored them like Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd. The rest was history as the movie became a success and earned a great reputation. I think it has some weaknesses or lets say it is not as much polished as their later movies but give a 10/10 no matter what."

And I loved it, I don't think it is quite as good as Life of Brian, but it is definitely one of the better Monty Python comedies for sheer hilarity and fun. The story like Life of Brian isn't the strongest component but this is in no way a criticism and yes the special effects are cheesy but perhaps that was the intention. My only problem with the film was that the ending is a little flat, but that is a minor criticism compared to how much I loved this film. The script is irreverent and highly quotable, and the soundtrack is even funnier. As a comedy it is wonderfully inventive, that debunks the Dark Ages and legends of chivalry through King Arthur, The Black Knight, God and the \"knights who say ni\". Comedy highlights include the trial with Connie Booth's witch and the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch sequence. Even the sets are quite well designed and authentic. And the acting is simply wonderful, John Cleese, Terry Jones(the encounter with Dennis's mother was hilarious), Graham Chapman, Terry Gilliam, Michael Palin and Eric Idle perfectly live up to their exceptional talents. Overall, a great comedy and a great film. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox"
