In the future of 2029 humanity was heavily decimated after a nuclear holocaust and is at war with the supercomputer Skynet and its machines. Shortly before being defeated Skynet sends one of his Terminators back in time to stop his biggest menace in form of the woman Sarah Connor. However the human resistance manage to send one of their soldiers named Kyle Reese back too. Now the battle for the future of humanity begins. The story is entertaining, succeeds in worldbuilding and creating lore you are invested in. It has of cause some loopholes but I think there is no movie that is 100,0% perfect. It matters that it is entertaining and works well. Action wise it delivers and has memorable scenes. It is a hard race against a seemingly unstoppable persecutor who will stop at nothing and has no compassion. The practical effects for the movie were for its time remarkable and I have seen newer movies with higher budgets performer much weaker. You can see again and again how much effort was put into the movie. The soundtrack by Brad Fiedel was great. It is amazing how a simple theme the Terminator theme is but is has become iconic. Lets go to the actors: We have in general a great performance and lets start with the Terminator himself Arnold Schwarzenegger. It is his most iconic role that everyone relates him to it. He does an excellent job as cruel, logical and efficient killing machine (I am not even sure if he speaks more than 100 words in the movie). Then we have Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor who is similar. She does also a great job and it will be her signature role too. She developed a lot in all the movies and the TV series. Finally for the trinity we have Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese. He is a great actor and his filmography is as excellent as his acting skills. The rest is a good addition but the main appeal are these 3 characters. Overall this is an iconic movie that I recommend for everyone who likes science fiction. It started the successful franchise that is still strong today even if the later movies are weaker (Of cause not Terminator 2 which is the best sequel in movie history or at least a frequent contender). It has the tropes and stories that give immersion and kept you engaged."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "a chilling and gritty action flick, the Terminator gives us a futuristic thrill ride where were given a chance to save the future from total annihilation\r Arnold Schwarzenegger is terrifying as the futuristing mechanical hunk, who was sent back in time to terminate the mother of a heroic leader of a future human rebellion, with Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese as humanity's only hope.\r James Cameron probably stands next to Ridley Scott and George Lucas as a modern sci-fi pioneer who gives a new wave of storytelling by adding more action that I can grasp to as one of my favorite thrillers of all time!"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Not as good as I remembered it being when I was a kid. I wish I could watch it again with those eyes"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "This film is one of the action classics that has never left the TV since it premiered. It started a cinematographic franchise that developed later and has been one of the most dystopian visions of the future of humanity in cinema: an extermination war between humans and machines.In this film, Sarah Connor is a young girl like so many others. However, she is the target of a dark killer, who will not stop until she is killed. When he is about to succeed, another man appears, saves her and tells him the truth: the killer is actually a complex machine, sent to the past to kill her before she can give birth to a guerrilla commander who, fifty years from then, will lead the war against machines.If it is action that we are looking for, this film takes that expectation seriously: what it offers us is pure and hard action, from start to finish. It's full of normal and welcome elements in films like this: destroyed cars, car chases, police cars, exploding trucks, highway shootings, high-speed cars. Okay, these folks in the Eighties and Nineties don't seem to be able to design an action movie without destroying cars! Nothing against it, but it is something that I found curious. I particularly liked the shooting sequence at the police station, and the ending, at the factory, is just as memorable.Linda Hamilton is the most interesting actress in the cast. She is a good actress, and shows talent in the scenes where she is allowed to. I say this because the film was not nice to her: the only thing she does most of the time is to be in danger and to look scared and confused. Still, she did it sincerely. Michael Biehn has more time and opportunities to show what is worth, and he too was extremely competent in his work. But it is Arnold Schwarzenegger who takes the rug off them and makes the film iconic. The film is still from that time when he was just a muscle mountain, hard as steel, with a strong, barely disguised, German accent. He couldn't be better, and it's hard to imagine another actor for the role.James Cameron ensures an inspired direction. He knew how to guide his team and get the best out of his cast. Being a 1984 film, I was expecting something different, much more dated and looking ugly, as many films of that decade seem to be now. However, I was very impressed: cinematography is beautiful and the film is sharp and excellently filmed; sets and costumes are, of course, a reflection of the time, but that was to be expected. What about visual and special effects? Okay, I'm willing to concede that they seem archaic to our eyes, but here the fault is ours. James Cameron is an effects expert and used the best there was... in 1984. And in fact, considering it's age, special effects will look much more magnificent. Before finishing, a word of praise for the main theme of the soundtrack designed by Brad Fiedel in synthesizer: undoubtedly, one of the most striking soundtracks for action cinema."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I know metacritic is for everyone to share their opinion, but how can this movie have that many negative and mixed/mediocre score? This movie in my opinion is better better than the t2, since it has way more suspense and have great flashbacks about the future."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "In regards of every single aspect, The Terminator is the textbook example of just how much can be done with as little money.With a simple, yet innovative use of camera movements, and different camera angles, James Cameron shot some of the most impressive action sequences and car chases. The use of zooming technique, in particular, in chases scenes also created a great deal of tension.Simply put, The Terminator is one of the best paced action movies ever. It's not fast as most of the cheesy action flicks of the eighties, nor slow-burning like Blade Runner's that definitely wouldn't suit the movie's tone. It's just perfect!Some may say the special effects are dated and don't hold up very well, but I don't mind them at all. In fact, I liked so much the visual effects, and I found them pretty convincing. The makeup is also remarkable for its time.What dazzles me aren't the effect, though, but the not-a-word-wasted dialogue. There is no line of dialogue that has been wasted. Every line or even gesture is as short as it's powerful as you can ever imagine.The movie isn't without its flaws, though. I found the way we got to know for the first time about the background story pretty lazy. Also, the whole situation was unsuitable for giving us information, but, nonetheless, the time was perfectly enough for us to know the most important things. There were also a couple of times later when the luck played a vital role in saving the protagonist's life. Besides, there is a glaring plot hole at the end of the movie that really drove me crazy till the credits roll.The movie features Arnold Schwarzenegger in his career-defining role, and I can easily see why. Casting him was a perfect choice to portray a relentless, rigid, indestructible cyborg. From seeing her vulnerable to accepting her fate, and trying to convince herself of it, Linda Hamilton is absolutely terrific as Sarah Connor. Michael Biehn is fantastic as well. Kyle Reese is my favorite character from the movie.A great score that just hits the right note by walking a fine line between the bleakness of the post-apocalyptic world and the cheesiness that distinguishes the movie's nature.Unpretentious filmmaking at its finest!(8.5/10)"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Terminator is a fun action movie!

It's Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance, who plays the murderous robot sent from the future to kill Sarah Connor. The way he portrays this robotic figure that doesn't have human emotion in him is phenomenal. He proves that he's just more than an handsome bodybuilder who looks good on screen. Arnold pretty much steals every scene he's in, but make no mistake, Linda Hamilton and the rest of the cast are also great. I actually really liked Paul Winfield's character, Lieutenant Ed Traxler. Usually in these type of movies, side-characters would bother me, but he was surprisingly charismatic and humanized. He wasn't just a one-dimensional cop. I appreciate that.Besides the action and the fast pacing, the movie also succeeds in telling a heartfelt story, with an astonishing chemistry between Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn (Kyle Reese). This movie fires on all cylinders (no pun intended) and sure is one of the best movies in my book.10/10"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "A pretty decent action movie...weird how much better the sequel is, though."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I think it has a very predictable plot but you can kind of enjoy the fast-paced action sequences."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "What a debut by director James Cameron for this movie that is one of those rare cases of a movie turning out to be inferior to its sequel but it still remains a great movie and surely a cult.

His legendary work here infuses the genre with dark and gritty noir. Heck, given the relentlessness and ferocity of it's antagonist it's darn near part horror as well. The film's world pulls no punches in any department. While certain aspects of the movie might seem simple by today's standards the film is no less impressive.\r The story is effectively conveyed through minimalist dialog. Characters do carry on conversations, but the actual backstory is told rather quickly so as to put the film's focus squarely on the conflict at hand. The time travel scenario may have you scratching your head at some points until you realize the ending is meant to set up the sequel. It doesn't completely wrap up the overall story b it's conclusion. It instead leaves you with a satisfying ending for it's story while leaving viewers with the promise of more.\r The characters are portrayed spot on by the actors, but the real star of the show is Arnold Schwarzenegger. He plays the ruthless and somewhat terrifying \"terminator\" to perfection. While ultimately he doesn't do much actual acting as his lines are kept to a minimum he still manages to instill terror at his presence. Also it's just as fun as ever to watch him shoot things up.\r The film also just does a lot of cool things. While the special effects are obviously dated today, it' not hard to notice how cool the scenes must have looked back in the day. There are some really cool effects going on that toady couldn't be done without at least a little CGI. Cameron made the film's most impressive moments (which usually involve gore) all happen without it. A very impressive feat considering the time.\r While aspects of it haven't aged well and it's not as groundbreaking today as it was when it first came out, this is still one of the most original and creative sci-fi movies out there. With a sharp plot, good writing, cool effects, and an original theme this is one that 's still worth watching. It still manages to stand out as one of the best sci-fi movies you'll ever watch. If you haven't seen it yet I highly recommend that you do.\r I give it an 8.9/10."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "61 Imbecis & Idiotas que n\u00e3o sabem o que \u00e9 filmes Revolucion\u00e1rios e Inteligentes...1984, James Cameron Dirige,Produz & Escreve o roteiro de um marco A\u00e7\u00e3o & Fic\u00e7\u00e3o Ci\u00eantifica no cinema...

I think this one would be well served if there were less of those action elements and more of the sci-fi and human drama that could really carry this one. I am not advocating removing all of the action elements, but use them less as it is numbing by the end of the film and you barely care about what is going on. There are certainly great moments, in particular the end of the film, but that is not action, rather it is the sci-fi/human drama element I like the most of this one. Sadly, those moments are few and far between, as the action dominates the screen and kills the rest.
