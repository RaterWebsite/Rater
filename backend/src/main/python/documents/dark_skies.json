We only see the aliens 5 minutes, and their motivations are totally unclear (they are extraterrestrials so we are not supposed to understand it...but I think their actions should make at least some sense.

Stewart does possesses talent--but he just hasn't created a satisfying film with it. In all three instances \"Priest\" (2011), \"Legion\" (2012) and now \"Dark Skies.\" The potential for a compelling story line and terror is there--but not achieved to satisfaction.\r In the Barrett household, something is seriously amiss. Is it that unemployed architect Daniel (Hamilton) is quietly panicked about finding a job while the mortgage bills pile up? That his marriage to Lacy (Keri Russell) is falling apart, turning their two sons (Dakota Goyo, Kadan Rockett) into stress cases? The wife is trying to pick up the financial slack of her laid-off architect husband (Josh Hamilton) by working as a real estate agent. Their two young sons start to notice odd things happening around the house. Things like snatching photos from frames--and eventually moving on in for their real goal--a child snatching. The audience has too much time to wonder why are the aliens here to bother playing tricks on this suburban family.The biggest problem with \"Dark Skies\" is that Stewart can never quite decide what story he is telling  a slow-burn horror parable, or paranoid invasion flick? Whether to focus on this character or that one while struggling to string together scares. Regardless, the pacing is tedious and boring--and the action is almost non-existant. Though it is saved in part by the performances of Russell and Hamilton, with a effective supporting turn by J.K. Simmons. The clouded storytelling in \"Dark Skies\" keeps the film from becoming more than a bunch of disjointed moments, and eventually settles for a ridiculous conclusion."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Good, scary but poor pacing and poor VFX but good scary as hell time!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Dark Skies is an ET movie full of creepy and bizarre visuals.

All in all a great scifi psuedo horror flick."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Signs and Paranormal Activity had a baby. Its a retread plain and simple. the aliens are kinda lame and the budget shows. the breadcrumb trail of the alien presence isnt very interesting, not enough weird hooks like in Signs to lead the viewer along. It also ends like Signs without the aliens having a weakness. its just fair"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "Just watched the final thirty minutes of Dark Skies. That was enough. My immediate thought at the conclusion was this is an extremely edited version of the first 3 episodes of the 2002 Taken series. One of the pivotal characters even has the same name, physical stature and age as the former.  Some suspense, however if you're one of those who likes everything tied up in a bow, you WILL be disappointed. The only thing more terrifying than the suggestion of what happens after the conclusion, is that the writer(s) figured, \"I'll wait 10 years shorten it down to 2 hours, release it as a feature(?) motion picture, collect 20M and call it a day.\" I'm surprised somebody wasn't knocking on they're door. Steven? You be the judge.   K"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This film isn't a 10 but rating it higher because it doesn't deserve a user score of 6.5.  This movie kept me entertained.  Keri Russell is one of my new favorite actresses."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I don't know what it is about this movie, but it got me spooked! There are moments of genuine terror in this movie that had me watching nervously. Wondering what would happen next had me nervous and gave me chills. I would love to see more alien themed horror movies, similar to this one, in the future. That being said the movie does have some flaws that get in the way of the fright. For one there are a lot of unintentional funny moments in this movie (the bird scene is hilarious XD), and I always hate when horror movies focus on things like family drama, which unfortunately this movie does. But when the movie is focusing all of its power and freaking you out with its mystery the movie is enjoyable and makes up for its duller moments. I wasn't expecting much from this movie, especially considering how stupid the trailers looked and how recent horror movies I've watched have not scared me at all. But Dark Skies proved to be the exception, providing some nice scares. I recommend this to any horror fans out there. It's really unique and we need more movies like it. It's just a shame that some of the goofier moments hold it back from being considered a truly great horror movie, instead of just a good one. Still I would rather watch a good horror movie rather than another crappy one."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Despite my love of Science Fiction, I had no desire to see Dark Skies. Someone from the groups Facebook page messaged me, telling me it was right up my alley, so I decided to give it a shot, and you know what, they were right! Dark Skies is portrayed as something completely different in the trailers and ads. I was under the impression that it was another of these crazy awful demonic possession films, but it was a whole lot more interesting than that. The Barrett family is experiencing some weird occurrences in their home that they can't explain. At first it seems like the kids are pulling pranks, but they come to realize it's much more serious than that. The family has become the target of an alien race known as the grays, and are fearing an eventual abduction. Felicity herself, Keri Russell, gives an interesting performance with a cold, quiet, intensity that was something to see, but the real star of the movie was young Dakota Goyo. Goyo is best known as the annoying little kid in Reel Steel, but he's grown up quickly, and was simply the most realistic character in the whole film. What makes Dark Skies unique is it's fantastic ending, which was very unexpected, and much more eclectic than one would expect to see in a film like this. Some fans complained that the ending was too reminiscent to that of 1408, and while it was similar, unlike 1408, the ending of Dark Skies wasn't nearly as predictable. The ending comes out of nowhere and as far as I'm concerned, it's the cherry on the sundae. Dark Skies wasn't as technical or scientific as the most of the Sci-Fi I like, but it was still quite entertaining and the ending made a good film that much better."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "A dark force from out of the world!It was one of the long due film, despite releasing just 4 years ago. Those who saw it said me not to miss it. But they also warned me it was a common horror theme with a slight change in the storyline. Since horror is the least average rated genre in my collection, I was not expecting it to be a masterpiece. That could be another reason why I liked it. Yeah, the same old blueprint horror flick, even though it was not as bad as what some people are saying. Except the opening quote reveals most of the film's twist. And the twist at the end was not actually a twist if a person knew it before.A small family struggling with finances, lately witnessing some strange events in the house. But once it takes a serious turn, now they must find a solution for it, or else the unity might fall apart. After getting some idea of everything happening, they meet an expert and gain some important inputs. Now their fightback begins, the challenge they are about to face going to decide the future of the family. Their plan and its execution, the remaining film is to tell us what happens to them.The JK Simmon's role was one of the most overused roles is horror films. I did not like that, but I liked his appearance. It is also an open end if this film gets a sequel. Like usual when a family struggling, people around them going blind were a clich\u00e9. Yeah, I know horror films can't get out of such thing. It's very rare to see a film out of these platforms. Yet it was an okay film, if you prefer a decent entertainment over an experimental film, which is not guaranteed entertainment. But usually it is an enjoyable flick by most of the people. Despite familiarity, one would have a nice time with it.7/10"}, {"rating": "2", "text": "This movie is terrible. I could barely even sit through the entire thing I was so bored. The acting is awful, and I feel like the writers went out of their way to make you hate all the characters. I hated every character in this movie, I couldn't care less what happened to them after it was over. The plot is terrible. Basically there are aliens that watch humans while they sleep, and then after like 6 months of watching people sleep they eventually take one of the family members. While okay in theory, it is a failure in practice. The aliens have a creepy presence, since you never directly see one, but they never really do anything. I don't understand why they have to watch people sleep for 6 months before they can finally take them. Also, almost everything that happens in the movie is completely unexplained. Watch the trailer for this movie and you can see every scary/creepy part of the entire movie. Literally. I knew exactly what was coming up every single time something scary happened. Note that these scenes never scared me, I could just tell it was the directors failed attempt at scaring us. I felt embarrassed for the directors multiple times throughout this movie. A kid wets his pants then screams for like 15 seconds straight for no reason whatsoever, and it did nothing but hurt my ears. I can't thing of a single good part of this movie other than the premise, which failed anyways.

It burrows alot from films like Signs, Paranormal Activity and Poltergeist but it doesn't quite hit it out of the park as well.

It's like a haunted house movie turned upside-down. It has a couple of jump scares, a good amount of suspense, and a heavy atmosphere that all come together to create a memorable and terrifying film.

There was a crispness to the film that I put down to the new technology used to shoot movies today. I thought the ending was a bit weak and it seemed that the family was subsequently being investigated after one of their sons disappears at the end. That created a funny ending.

Don't watch this, all I can say"}, {"rating": "5", "text": "This is a sci-fi thriler film, with horror elements and it covers themes including jobs interviews, abductions and blackouts. The film has a pretty obvious spooky, somewhat sinister, ghostly feel to it, with scenes (certainly after the first one or two) mostly in the dark and a chilly sounding music played in the background to unsettle viewers. However, the lack of a clear plot meant that I didn't really 'buy it', not being sure quite what was supposed to be going on, let alone why. As events slowly develop, it reminded me a bit of films such as Poltergeist or the Paranormal Activity films, as strange things happen within the house, as if targetting the family living there but there is little to see, visually, to scare us, as such, for the most part. There is a pretty strong sense of foreboding but (pardon the pun) I didn't especially like being in the dark as to the specifics of what may be around said next corner.I did, however, feel a bit frustrated by the attitude shown by the police during the plot - I won't elaborate for fear of providing spoilers. I also found myself feeling suspicious about various family members due to their behaviour and some plot aspects, so I suppose it was relatively good at providing a mysterious and tense atmosphere.Cast wise, the wife, Lacy Barrett, is played by Keri Russel and the husband, Daniel Barrett, is played by Josh Hamilton, while son Sam Barrett is played by Kadan Rockett and Jesse is played by Dakota Goyo. I don't think I'm familiar with their work - the film did have a bit of a 'b movie' feel to it but thats not to say it was awful, although I don't imagine it had an excessively high budget to play with. The only cast member I recognised from other film cast lists was J.K. Simmons, who plays Edwin Pollard.Content wise, the film contains sex related content, moderate violence including gun related violence, fist fights and self inflicted injury and some moderately strong language. There are scenes indicating drug use happens but we're not shown in any detail it actually being consumed. Otherwise, as I've mentioned previously, the film has quite a lingering sinister or mysterious tone to it and there are some sudden events which happen, that could fairly easily frighten young, child viewers. This film is very much a supernatural type of horror/thriller - I wouldn't say its especially scary to/for adults but it could pretty easily unsettle young kids. The film has been given a 15 rating due to said content.The main idea behind this film is far from original and while its decently spooky, its not an especially memorable film. I liked some aspects of it but wasn't impressed by others and I suppose overall I'd have to go for a middle of the road, 3 star rating. I also felt that the ending left the viewer with unanswered questions, which can be quite frustrating for some.I wouldn't say this is one of the better examples of this type of film but it isn't awful either. Its not bad, its intriguing and is quite tense but it isn't as chilly or sinister as other similar films I've come across before. Its alright, worth a watch, yes but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to encourage people to pay money to see it, so think of this as a decent enough watch if it comes on TV but otherwise not especially worth shelling out much money for. Some people may enjoy this more than others, as it depends on if your keen on this style of film, very much along the lines of Paranormal Activity - indeed the film was made by producers of said Paranormal Activity films, so I believe. If it sounds right up your street then yes I would recommend it but otherwise not so much, so I guess ill opt for undecided as middle ground."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "The cast is very good and they give a great performance.
