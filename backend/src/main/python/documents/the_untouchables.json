But if you're looking for some white knuckle, high-octane, Hollywood popcorn fun, and a satisfyingly pissed off Sean Connery to boot, then welcome to Brian De Palma and David Mamet's \"The Untouchables,\" one of cinema's premier gangster flicks, and deservedly so. It's endlessly quotable and ruthlessly staged, featuring some beautiful camera work and a wicked score from Ennio Morricone. They rarely make them like this anymore, if ever."

A linear and compellingly \u201cfictionalized\u201d account of how G-Man Elliot Ness took down gangland kingpin Al Capone.  Set in prohibition era Chicago, the film features several virtuoso set pieces, not the least of which helped Sean Connery win a much deserved Oscar.  The Art Direction is as breathtaking as Ennio Morricone\u2019s brilliant score."

      "text": "I have seen many movies, and while The Untouchables is not the best movie of all of them, it is one I enjoyed enormously. There is so much to recommend it and I found it great to watch. The story is riveting and well constructed, and while he doesn't show off as such, a good thing in my book, Brian DePalma does let loose with some very inventive not to mention bloody set pieces. See the climax at the railway station for instance, while essentially a nod to the famous Odyssey steps sequence in the Battleship Potemkin, it was brilliantly done all the same. Speaking of DePalma, he does do a wonderful job directing.That isn't the only reason why the Untouchables was such a hit with me. There are many more reasons. The dialogue is like crackling fire works, it is witty, intelligent and sophisticated, and some of it goes by surprisingly quickly. Ennio Morricone is one of the finest film composers ever, his score here is no exception, as it soars very like an eagle in full flight. And we have some truly sparkling production design, I love films with beautiful sets, scenery and costumes and The Untouchables scored highly in this area. Then we have very strong acting, Kevin Costner mayn't be to everybody's tastes but I think in his star-making turn he gave one of his better performances in this film. Andy Garcia joins the team with enthusiasm, and a plumped-up Robert DeNiro as Al Capone is wonderful as always. However, in my opinion, as the Irish cop who shows Costner the ropes, Sean Connery one of the most charismatic actors around gives the best and even perhaps most memorable performance here.Overall, a wonderful film, with an awful lot to recommend it. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

He isn't Scorsese , that's why goodfellas worked , and yes they're similar although they're telling story from different prospective! another nuch better movie American gangster! Good thing - 1) PRODUCTION DESIGN- they just nailed it , no question! 2) AL CAPONE PERFORMANCE- Every single scene with him is on another level. They way he portrays a Italian mafia is just awesome! He studied a lot about al Capone. His dialogue, his body language , movement, reactions feels genuine! Only thing u will remember after u finish this film. No not sean Connery lol Bad thing 1] UNINTERESTING MAIN CHARACTERS- Costner is just opposite to de niro. He's just a terrible choice to play the leading role. Not to mention bad acting, also lacks the charm to play opposite de niro. He has same wooden face throughout the movie. From the beginning they showed al Capone is invincible and no one can touch him and his business! Ok. Director and writer be like let's create a looser club so audience can relate with them. No , that's hilarious. The accountant guy goes full on Rambo in the bridge, again funny! When Connery shots that dead guy to make the other guy talk is a really powerful scene. The elevator scene is pretty good. Not the train station scene, here bad guy's aim just sucks. 2) BAD MUSIC 3) BAD DIRECTION,4) LAZY WRITING.... That's it !"

De toute fa\u00e7on, son r\u00f4le est un peu trop discret pour ne pas dire sensiblement \u00e9lud\u00e9, je m'attendais \u00e0 autre chose.Quant \u00e0 Kevin en justicier raide comme la justice, s'il mord un petit peu la ligne jaune, il n'en reste pas moins assez falot... au contraire du grand Sean qui s'affirme comme le vrai chef de toute l'op\u00e9ration, grande gueule et trompe-la-mort... Le ton global du film oscille d'ailleurs entre la l\u00e9g\u00e8ret\u00e9 et une violence qui ne fait pas dans la dentelle, un curieux m\u00e9lange qui fait plut\u00f4t penser \u00e0 une bande dessin\u00e9e en fait.Cela \u00e9tant dit, De Palma dispense une tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able mise en sc\u00e8ne dont il ma\u00eetrise tous les rouages, faits d'\u00e9l\u00e9gance et de raffinement (cf la sc\u00e8ne dans la gare avec... le landau !) et la musique fort r\u00e9ussie d'Ennio Morricone soutient avec \u00e0-propos cette r\u00e9alisation d\u00e9cid\u00e9ment sans faille. Et incorruptible.Un film plut\u00f4t contrast\u00e9 finalement et n\u00e9anmoins bien men\u00e9. S'il p\u00e2tit d'un Kevin Costner en demi-teinte, l'ensemble reste divertissant et tr\u00e8s fluide (mais n'a rien \u00e0 voir avec un Scarface...)."

      "text": "that's the chicago way..The UntouchablesThere are some nail biting sequences created that leaves you with an awe but for the rest of the feature the character link and the world portrayed is weak contrary to its premise. Brian De Palma chews off too much for his characters that sometimes comes off as a bit slow and downer for the audience especially when the script is wafer thin. Kevin Costner; as the protagonist is convincing but the real game changers are the supporting cast i.e. Sean Connery and Robert De Niro. The Untouchables; being of course a character driven feature, doesn't seek attention especially in its first half that is barely standing on any grounds and is fortunately saved by the second half where things get brutal, up close and personal offering the perfect amount of drama that was essential all along."

      "text": "This film takes place during the Prohibition, the golden age of American Mafia, and shows the difficulties that law enforcement \u200b\u200bhad to arrest Al Capone, Chicago's biggest mafia boss. Brian de Palma seems to have a powerful attraction for violence and the mafia, this being his second major film on the subject (the first, if I'm not mistaken, was \"Scarface\"), but there is no doubt that his work was good and deserves congratulations. The story is told from the point of view of law enforcement, which is a novelty since most of the films that focus on Al Capone tend to show his life, or moments of his criminal course. This film shows him as the big villain he was and glorifies police officers, easily transforming Eliott Ness (played brilliantly by Kevin Costner in one of the most interesting works of his career) into a paladin of justice and law. Robert De Niro revisits his gangster movies (\"The Godfather\", \"Goodfellas\" etc.) in a curious and comic interpretation of Al Capone, and Sean Connery plays a street policeman of Irish descent. In fact, it was precisely in this character that Connery got his only Oscar, despite all actors have fulfilled my expectations. The film is well constructed, looking to alternate epic action scenes (sometimes recalling in my mind the glory of cavalry battle charges) with moments of great psychological depth and some suspense. At times, however, the film seems a bit forced, with exaggerated appeals to sentimentality, as it does in the final sequence, often parodied or imitated in later films. Another problem with the film is that it is not faithful to historical events. Al Capone's arrest was not like that, nor was Ness behind it. The film contains some scenes of great violence and is inadvisable for children, adolescents and impressionable people."

      "text": "An old-school kinda goofy gangster flick is never what you think it would be when there is a remarkable filmmaker like Brian De Palma behind the camera. Alongside with Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Untouchables proves that old-style action movies is far from being dated. In fact, they are nothing but timeless.The Untouchables is a deeply entertaining cop/mob movie. But what made it stand the test of time, besides its A-List cast, is its unique, and exceptional direction by none other than Brian De Palma. There is no shortage of De Palma's trademarks and his own visual style, nor his way of creating the tension that shouldn't be considered far behind Hitchcock's. But I don't think I've been shocked so many times in a movie before like here. The Untouchables's zany humor and wackiness can't make you think for a moment that it can be so brutal like that. It's like you know you're watching a PG-13 movie then all of a sudden comes a ruthless scene filled with gore and blood.But what impressed me the most in this movie is how Brian De Palma simply could made us think \"The Untouchables\" are very touchable, and their mission is impossible to be done just by showing us a scene featuring the pure evil, Al Capone. De Niro's lunatic over-the-top performance was more than enough to make the viewers feel worry as much as the titular team.The issues I've with this movie are with the silly and ridiculous nature of this movie. Yes, this very thing that I've praised above. Because halfway through the movie I think De Palma went too far making the movie's tone so absurd and ludicrous that you have to turn my brain off, while the movie didn't ask me to do so. Especially when the movie contains some very serious and emotional moments that worked so well on their own. So I felt there is a lot of inconsistency, and the tone could have been balanced way better. That being said, I enjoyed the entire movie even its brainless moments.It would be unnecessary to mention that all the performances are superb. But Kevin Costner's performance helped flesh out his character, Eliot Ness. Speaking of which, all the characters are well-established, and have enough depth to serve the plot and to make you care about them.The end is a little bit rushed, and could seem implausible for some. But I think it makes all the sense looking back on all what have been established throughout the movie.The Untouchables is not Scarface, but it offers a genuine entertainment that can't be resist. Can't wait to see more of De Palma's work, let alone Domino that will be released later this year.(8.5/10)"

Quite a perfect movie: great cast (my favourite actors here are Sir Sean Connery -his scene on the bridge where Malone meets Agent Nell!- first of all, followed by Bob De Niro -Capone at the barbershop!- both in excellent performances) and the cinematography too. This kind of criminal masterpiece is going to disappear on today's screens, unfortunately !"

DeNiro as Al Capone is really quite sinister and its certainly a pretty gripping film in general. I was aware of the general story but not all the details and so I found this, I suppose, an insightful watch, although I can't be sure how accurate it is. There was one long scene set in I think Grand Central station, feautring a mother and a pram, that really did have me right at the edge of my seat. I thought the use of incidental music was quite well judged too - not too little and not too over the top. There are some nice settings/locations too. I would definitely recommend this film, yes."
