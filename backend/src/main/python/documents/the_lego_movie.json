At first, i honestly thought the animation was a joke and was waiting for it to change from 1970's style stop motion animation to something from 2014 but nope! It stayed like that the entire movie. I just couldnt enjoy the clunky way the characters moved and eventually fell asleep (thankfully). The only saving grace was the batman character which made me smile but i cant remember laughing out loud once. I tried people! i really did....it was the animation that totally killed it for me."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "There was the initial worry to whether a film based on a popular (and timeless) children's toy merchandise would work, as results have been mixed on that front, but the trailer did look amusing and the reviews and ratings were great and I as a huge animation fan saw it anyway. The good news is that it does work, yes it is a little rushed at times, especially towards the end, and the last half hour got a touch complicated (if the pacing had slowed down then it would have helped). But what was so brilliant about The Lego Movie was how it took this merchandise and managed to make such a colourful, clever, imaginative and enormously entertaining film out of it when it could have easily been the opposite. The animation is really first rate, the vibrant yet dynamic colours are remarkably vivid and a lot of the visuals especially in the action are very inventive. There is a bright and breezy soundtrack that compliments The Lego Movie beautifully, wasn't that \"Awesome\" song catchy or what? The Lego Movie's chief selling point is that it is an outstandingly well-written film with snappy dialogue and thick and fast jokes that all hit their mark, by far the funniest film I've seen in a while. The action is also block-busting in the very best of ways. It's not all hilarious though, because there is a lot of heart in The Lego Movie and the message will be an inspiration to anybody. The characters have their entertaining quirks and personalities yet the film really allows you to properly care for them as well, the most colourful being the villain President Business. And what a fine voice cast too, with Will Ferrell stealing the show, he is a hoot, but Morgan Freeman's dignified blind seer and Will Arnett's splendidly dour Batman are worthy of note too. Chris Pratt is a likable, chirpy protagonist but not quite as memorable as the supporting roles. To conclude, a brilliant and near-perfect film, animated or otherwise, that people of all ages and the whole family can enjoy. 9/10 Bethany Cox"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Really liked it.

Ultimately, however, I walked away with a headache and feeling significantly let down. I do not understand all of the outstanding reviews and praise the movie is receiving either, to be completely honest.\r The visual effects, story, and voice acting in The Lego Movie are all superb! I will definitely give it that. Where the movie falls short though is in its execution - tedious and somewhat recycled scenes, humor reminiscent of Nick Jr. television shows, and a far too lengthy running screen time. There was maybe about 10 times throughout the film that I did get a hearty laugh in, but for the most part, I found myself trying, more than one should in a movie, to truly enjoy what I was watching.\r If you have children, your experience might be different. Even if you don't, I believe the only way you'll know if you like it is to experience it yourself - it obviously, based on the wide praise, has been enjoyed by a great amount of people! As for me, this is one I can't quite manage to recommend, which is a shame. I truly hope your experience of The Lego Movie is better!

I didn't have any real expectations going into it. I mean, it was called the LEGO movie, so interesting could it actually be? It was...unique, I'll give it that.\r You know how most movies throw in the occasional pop culture reference? Something witty, something that will be a little more memorable than other parts of said movie? The LEGO movie was built upon those. I mean, they were EVERYWHERE. Cat posters, Batman's attitude, Good/Bad cop (they weren't even trying to be subtle with this one).\r And the cliches. For crying out loud, could a movie about creativity do something original? 'Strong' female protagonist that needs a man, no one dies at the end, every single subplot resolves itself, hero goes on journey and discovers self, I mean, come on! I was actually happy when I thought that Emmett died, and would become a martyr or something but NOPE!!! Spoiler, not really, he lives! You know why this wasn't tagged as a spoiler? Because there was no way that he could die. The movie's cliches made him immortal.\r Story-wise, it sucked. There was no story. Well, nothing that wasn't covered by the cliches at least. I guess one could say it was satire, but you know what? Satire really doesn't make up for no interesting plot whatsoever.\r Now, for the 'positive' part. The animation style was great. It fit the Lego theme really well, and I wouldn't mind seeing that in other movies. The voice talent did a good job, and you know what? They occasionally did a clever thing during an action sequence. This all would merit it a 5.\r Unfortunately, the 5 was downgraded to a 4, for the terrible ending. Not going to spoil it, but...really?

It has a star studded cast, good animation, a plot and message that's developed pretty well and is thoughtful, and it has great comedy. Pop culture references are spread throughtout and they are a nice touch. Emmet, Wyldstyle, Vitruvius, Batman, Benny, Lord Buisness, Princess Unikitty, and Good Cop/Bad Cop are all great characters. The large celebrity cast (Chris Pratt, Will Ferrel, Elizabeth Banks, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, Cobie Smulders, and Will Arnett) are all great Lego Minifigures as well. The DC superheroes are funny (but no Marvel ones though?). The movie has lots of potential, and with its box office ($335 million so far compared to a 60 million budget) it will surely become a blockbuster franchise.\r SPOLIER ALERT:\rMy only complaint was that the live action part of the movie was a bit weak, and was not as satisfying as the rest of the film.\r I just am waiting for the sequel (aimed for a May 2017 release date). I hope the entire cast returns (and that it brings a new story and new characters)! I recommend that you watch it, especially if you have children.

By all rights, it had no right to be good, as it seemed like a complete complete cosh cow movie. But somehow, it turned out to be the one of the most imaginative and fun movies for the whole family that takes a twist into straight up meta commentary by the end. The big thing that makes the movie run so well, apart from the really fast comedy coming at you most of the time, comes from the fact that it is, in fact, a LEGO movie, thus everything is based around LEGO physics, motion, and logic. This leads to a lot of jokes and clever use of the set pieces, which I mean quite literally. Honestly, I don\u2019t think the movie would have worked if it took itself completely seriously, but since the plot runs on complete irony, that\u2019s not a problem. Oh, and the acting is superb too, including Charlie Day, who I never would have recognized were it not for the credits. I\u2019m not sure if anyone who hasn\u2019t played with LEGOs or had a kid who did so would enjoy this movie as much apart from the subtle adult jokes that would slip past the kids, but maybe they could.

When I watched The LEGO Movie, in February 2014, my expectations were actually exceeded. The film is a success for many different reasons, thanks to its many layers of meaning; it gives the audience not only what they want, but also what they don\u2019t know they want just yet. The story, focused on different aspects of the LEGO experience, combines impeccable CGI action, surprisingly sharp social critique, and a heartwarming message. As if this wasn\u2019t enough, it\u2019s directed by 21 Jump Street\u2019s hot duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, and its voice cast includes Chris Pratt (you\u2019ll see him in Guardians of the Galaxy soon), Will Ferrell, Elizabeth Banks and Will Arnett. Plus Morgan Freeman voicing Vitruvius, the half-looney half-prophet wizard. And did I mention Liam Neeson, playing Bad Cop (or Good Cop, depending on what turn his interrogation takes)? Considering the past results in developing a cinematic product based on well-established brands (mostly hit and miss, to use an understatement), the outcome is astonishingly positive. The LEGO Movie has become Warner Bros. Pictures\u2019 most commercially successful animated film, grossing almost $500 million worldwide, and soon due for release in DVD and Blu-ray. Whereas extra content is meagre (limited to three amateur shorts and the film\u2019s main song singalong video), it\u2019s well worth saving The LEGO Movie a spot on your shelf.\r The LEGO Movie\u2019s story develops the proverbial \u201cEveryman turns into hero\u201d arch in three acts: the film opens presenting Emmet, an ordinary construction worker who lives following instructions. President Business tells him (and all citizens) what to do and decides what should make him happy, and Emmet is ecstatic to comply: he buys overpriced coffee, endlessly quotes awful sitcom catchphrases, sings to the most annoying (and most memorable) tune in the history of made-to-be-abhorred songs, happily follows every precept of his society in order to fit in. Sounds like the world surrounding you, doesn\u2019t it? Well, Emmet also happens to be the \u201cChosen One\u201d, he who is revealed will save the LEGO universe from the threat of Business\u2019s secret weapon: superglue. Along with a team of whacky rebels, Emmet will travel across lands in a journey of self-discovery, personal growth and meta-reflections on the spirit of LEGO as a product. With a closing moral that poignantly celebrates art for art\u2019s sake.\r Who initially thought that all this is just product placement, may want to take a closer look: The LEGO Movie doesn\u2019t make you want to buy and play LEGO, it just makes you want to watch the film again and again. You can\u2019t get enough of its hilarious and nipping approach, elevating even the most mundane stuff into joie de vivre: from special effects entirely made of LEGO (explosions, smoke, fire, and even the shower\u2019s water) and over-the-top action sequences, to countless cool references to pop culture and the history of LEGO (Benny, the \"1980-something space guy\" with an obsession for building spaceships, wears an helmet cracked in the exact spot where real-life LEGO pieces would usually break). I could go on forever. The LEGO Movie is the kind of film that you find yourself quoting as soon as you leave the cinema: \u201cAnd when this happens\u2026 and when Vitruvius says\u2026 and when Batman does this and that\u2026\u201d. Oh boy, I feel like I\u2019m 10 again. At that age I had a few cherished VHS of animated classics that I never grew tired of watching: The Sword in the Stone, 101 Dalmatians, Robin Hood, Toy Story.

Some rules are necessary for an orderly society, but we have gone down the wrong road with our Draconian state (started long before the current administration).
