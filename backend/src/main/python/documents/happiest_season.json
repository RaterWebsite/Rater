      "text": "Originally intended for theatrical release this charming LGBT Christmas movie explores the struggles many of us gay people face when it comes to our families and the holiday season. Starring Kristen Stewart as one half of a lesbian couple who is invited by her girlfriend played by Mackenzie Davis of Terminator Dark Fate to spend the holidays with her family. Along the way she tells her that the family doesn't know shes gay or that she's bringing her girlfriend. Funny scenarios as well as heart wrenching ones ensue. The movie is quite refined in the way it explores its subject matter and for that reason, that's what sets it apart. The brilliant Dan Levy of the phenomenal Schitts Creek stars as Stewart's gay bff. Mary Steenburgen (book club), Allison Brie (Glow), Victor Garber and an awesome Aubrey Plaza also star. The film is director confidently by one of my favorite actresses Clea Duvall. It's definitely a must see.****.25/5"

I was expecting to relate to her more (for various reasons) but found myself yelling at the TV.The characters on the periphery were the most interesting, but not enough to carry the movie.LGBTQ+ rom coms don't have to center around coming out and secret keeping...Also, having the only two prominent POC characters being written into a lazy infidelity storyline was... odd."

Kristen Stewart and MacKenzie Davis were so incredible and gave very realistic performances, especially in regards to coming out and familial expectations. Dan Levy was amazing. Aubrey Plaza was pleasant surprise (if not a total scene stealer). Also, the character Jane was perfect in every way. This movie is a must see for the holidays!"

      "text": "If you're not exhausted by all of those romantic Hallmark Christmas movies that have populated almost every basic cable channel, then you should venture over to Hulu to check out its latest original movie, Happiest Season. Unlike your run-of-the-mill Hallmark fare, Happiest Season has actual movie stars and some semblance of a budget. The film attempts to infuse that romantic comedy vibe into what happens when your girlfriend invites you home for Christmas and along the way she tells you that her parents don't know she's a lesbian and you'll have to pretend to be just her platonic, orphan roommate for 5 days. We've all been there in some shape or form; nevertheless, hijinks ensue.Directed by Clea Duvall and co-written by Duvall and Mary Holland, Happiest Season tells the fish-out-of-water story crossed with the poignant theme of the struggle to hide your identity added in there. It is all wrapped in the cozy Christmas blanket of one of those ensemble family holiday tropes. Kristen Stewart stars as little orphan Abby, who doesn't like Christmas, but she's happy to be a part of the holiday family traditions with her girlfriend, Harper, played by Mackenzie Davis, until things are complicated by Harper still being in the closet to her conservative and hyper-competitive family. Abby is forced to endure both a holiday she doesn't enjoy and being set aside so her partner can pretend to be something she's not.The unfortunate part of Happiest Season is that Harper and her family come off as completely unlikeable, except for youngest sister Jane, played by co-writer, Mary Holland. Jane has some of the funniest moments as the most authentic person in the family. While the actors do a good job of playing their parts, the writing of the characters doesn't make a case for why Abby would want to be a part of the family. If this is a romantic comedy, then there is a failure to provide the romance, especially in the central characters. It never really makes sense why Abby and Mackenzie would be together and this trip would otherwise solidify that.The comedy bit is more successful. Daniel Levy pops up throughout as Abby's best friend, John. He has some good lines and is a welcome presence. Alison Brie also does her best as Harper's uptight sister. As I mentioned before, Jane cracked me up each time she was around. As these Christmas movies go, it ticks the boxes on being inoffensive, relatively fun and pleasant. The message about family at this time of year, in this year in particular, hits home.Although the central mission of Happiest Season doesn't quite work, overall the film is pleasant and a good addition to the Christmas film queue. There are some laughs and, if you like Christmas, you'll get Christmas. Because of Daniel Levy and Mary Holland, you can just turn on this movie with a bowl of popcorn and have some chuckles throughout the holiday season."

In this case it might've been because she was stuck in this lazy lesbian Christmas turkey that is so aggressively diverse it ALMOST distracts the viewer from the fact the film is a turgid slog into holiday film hell. - 1 star"

      "text": "It's a fairly feel-good film, but it's so sweetened, that it ends up cloying the palate.Putting aside the positive element of its inclusive theme, the problems lie in the fact that its narrative resources of acceptance and pain are rooted in cliches of \"moments of revelation\", therefore the climax and the conflict are so predictable that you see them coming almost from the beginning, and that, no matter how hard it tries, the film never manages to shake it off.And it takes that issue until the end, because for that same romantic and Christmas theme, the film has no choice but to unify the entire plot in a happy ending, so naturally you know where everything is going at all times.So the whole functional capability of this film lies in how much you're willing to buy from it as a viewer.If you're looking for a story like this to have a good time, you will love it, but it will only take you that far, yet in the end, that's all this film is looking for."

The writing was outstanding, a beautiful and touching story with a nice amount of comedy in it. Kristen Stewart, Dan Levy, Mary Holland, Mary Steenburgen, Mackenzie Davis, and Alison Brie gave excellent performances, they gave really funny performances and Kristen, Mary Steenburgen, and Mackenzie's performances were also emotionally powerful. The costumes especially ones wore by Kristen Stewart, Dan Levy, Alison Brie, and Mary Steenburgen were terrific. The music was superb. This was an A+ movie, love to see the continuous LGBTQ+ representation in mainstream media."
