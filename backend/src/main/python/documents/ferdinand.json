  "description": "Ferdinand, a little bull, prefers sitting quietly under a cork tree just smelling the flowers versus jumping around, snorting, and butting heads with other bulls. As Ferdinand grows big and strong, his temperament remains mellow, but one day five men come to choose the \"biggest, fastest, roughest bull\" for the bullfights in Madrid and Ferdinand is mistakenly chosen.  Based on the classic 1936 children's book by Munro Leaf.",

      "text": "As far as animated kids movies go, this is pretty good. While it does contain the tired \"be yourself\" cliche that all kids entertainment seems to spout these days, it doesn't lean into that too hard. Rather, it's more about friendship and doing the right thing in the face of adversity.  There's a couple of mild off-color jokes and some slightly scary/tense moments, but nothing really concerning. Set in Spain, the music and artwork does a great job of setting the appropriate tone. The character of Nina is appealing and well designed/acted - I wish she played a larger role in the movie.  Wrestler John Cena voices the titular Ferdinand, and does a good job in the role; he's always been charismatic and kid-friendly during his tenure in the WWE, and those qualities come across here. Overall a very sweet film that I recommend without hesitation for kids and families."

I often read complaints from reviewer's about how a version of a story has been done before. Hell, almost EVERY children's story, in one way or another, has been done before. There are only so many ways to write a fairy tale.. \"Ferdinand\" takes a nice story and gives it feeling, personality and depth. The voice-overs by pro-wrestling superstar John Cena and Kate McKinnon were outstanding. \"Ferdinand\" is the second best animated movie, from a major studio, in 2017. Only \"Coco\" was better. Its too bad that \"Ferdinand\" premiered on the same day as \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi.\" It got lost amidst all of the Star Wars hype. It deserved a better audience."

I mean, the animation is good, the voices actors are ok, there some scenes that i gigle and he third act is impressive since there's almost no dialogue. \u00bfDoes that makes the movie good? Unfortunately no. The characters are annoying, idiots and boring, the jokes aren't funny, the message is really bad recived, there's a lot of cliche and unfunny stuff and most of the movie is dedicated to have slasptick, butt jokes, pop cultres jokes and another annoying story of animals in an adventure to go home. I don't see why this movie is nominated for 2 Golden Globes, i don't think they worth it. Is a shame that someone like Carlos Sahldana (Who's not a bad director, i like Ice Age 2 and 3 and also Rio) had to go in a more overuse way that we have seen before in staed of show us something new and creative"

They got awfully owned by the way better Force Awakens when it came to that Alvin and the Chipmunks movie. Ferdinand, on the other hand, attempts to become way better than Fox's latest attempt to bring the chipmunks back to theaters but that doesn't mean that Ferdinand is a second option to send children or basically the whole family just in case they have already seen the latest Star Wars movie. I just wish 20th Century Fox would just stop releasing movies like these on the same day as Star Wars gets released to theaters unless they can bring a way better movie that isn't juvenile like their latest attempts yet. Literally worth the shot once it becomes able for rent but don't expect to find anything that can hold this movie back from its score."

The movie perks up a little when the goat is introduced and gives the movie some much needed humor, but sometimes the goat's humor feels forced.  The horses are the funniest part of the film, but they don't have a lot of screen time.  The \"bull in the china shop\" scene is clever.  Overall, pretty forgettable and middle of the road."

      "text": "1. Happy Holidays!2. Thanks to Disney,Fox will never release movies like this on the same day as Star Wars,THANK GOD.Ok,now onto the review.Ice Age 6 was b... Wait. It's not another Ice Age? Oh,thank goodness... But it's released on the same day as Star Wars? This doesn't look promising... Or does it? Because Ferdinand was a perplexing seat,honestly. Kind of like the Ice Age sequels: It's not good,but it's also not bad. As an adaptation from a kids' book,it's fine as a distraction for your kids,and it may be okay for adults,but I just don't think you can adapt 80 pages into a movie,and yet a major studio is doing this movie. Unlike Ice Age Collision Course,it does take control of itself,though. And so does its animation. While being shown with John Powell's accurate Spanish score,the animation is so impressive in here,it sometimes takes a leap into the term 'Artistic Cinematography'. And hey,the charachter animation is probably one of the best of the year,so there's that.I was also impressed with John Cena's voicework as Ferdinand,as well as Kate McKinnon as Lupe,even if it can get annoying at times (it's no Despicable Me 3,don't worry).But where does Ferdinand fall apart as a 'Middle-of-the-road Movie'? The story and the humor.As i said in the beginning,it's kind of impossible to adapt 80 pages into a movie,yet Blue Sky Studios takes some risks both story-wise and tone-wise,and i'm fine with it,but only if you do it correctly,because yeah,it's fine in several moments,but it can ruin the pace at certain times.Oh,and if you're wondering why the humor is one of the movie's flaws,here's this: Never make a Horse dab ever again,PLEASE. I get that they're trying to appeal to a certain audience,but can we just don't do that again?Overall,Ferdinand was a serviceable kids' movie. It's no Road-Chip and it's no Collision Course,but it still suffers from the story's execution and the (honestly) horrid humor.In a word: A-Ok."

I was put off by the use of the word \"sucks\" several times in a movie ostensibly for children, and there were the obligatory multiple references to butts, which become predictable and tiresome after a while.  The movie did, for the most part, manage to avoid references to excretory functions, which seem to be the source of much of what passes for humor in kids' movies these days.  Ferdinand is a very pleasant movie for younger children to see."

Every bad joke you could imagine is in this movie; they are very silly, they are clich\u00e9d and they are so long that make you bored!- There are a lot of useless characters who are often supposed to be funny (okay, maybe the hedgehogs weren't that bad), and their introduction seemed like short films not just because they are long scenes but also very bad edited.- Unexpectedly, the relationship between the little girl and Ferdinand seemed to be forced to the movie. I really think it's not that important to the story, and the movie itself didn't care so much about it; it didn't give it a lot of time to be emerged or to be felt throughout the movie."

      "text": "it's about time we meet again..FerdinandThe animated features are supposed to attract the viewers into their new and attention seeking world and to be rich in details which helps connecting to them, unfortunately none of it is offered in here. Just a mere idea is projected by Carlos Saldanha; the director, which already was present in the original book and addition to that, it fails on delivering what was already there too. John Cena at the centre of it, is quite convincing but in here Kate McKinnon steals the show as her character is strong too along with her work. Ferdinand is a forward pass in its first act and a complete downer on its second one where all the clich\u00e9d characters and sequences jumps in that awaits and predicts the last act that even though being exhilarating (the chase scene is the only high point of the feature) couldn't charm anyone."

It\u2019s not perfect, and I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s on the same level as most Disney or Pixar films (Ironic saying that since this is now technically a Disney movie after they bought out 20th Century Fox but now I\u2019m getting off topic here), and I don\u2019t see myself watching it again anytime soon, but if you are interested, it\u2019s worth a look."

      "text": "\"Gee Ferdinand, I wish the world worked like that for ya\", is the line said by ferdinand's father to him at the starting, just before he was going to leave the ranch, is a great line. The problem is that the movie never takes that forward, it just ends up being a hugely predictable story and a shabby script and dialogue. Another problem was the ending, which is sooo like blue sky studios. If it were pixar or dreamworks, they would have made it much more interesting and emotional. I also felt they ruined it by showing that Nina come at the end, for no damn reason at all. It should explored the message it wanted to convey more, instead of just making it a bland story with a bad ending. But to the film's credit, it had great animation and you can't deny that it's filled with wit and humor, making it a fun ride throughout, also having some great voice-acting. But in the end, it's just another bad attempt by blue sky studios."

      "text": "Ferdinand is an animated film based on the children's book \"The Story of Ferdinand\" by Munro Leaf and Robert Lawson. The movie, directed by Carlos Saldanha and produced by the studio behind the Ice Age and Rio films, follows the story of a Spanish fighting bull named Ferdinand (voiced by John Cena) who dreams of a non-violent life. When he is mistaken for a fierce fighter and recaptured by his former trainer, he is determined to prove himself as the peaceful bull he knows himself to be. The film is visually pleasing, with a colorful animation style and a playful, light-hearted tone. It also touches on themes of conventional masculinity and animal cruelty, and is suitable for younger viewers. While it may not be highly original, Ferdinand is a fun and heartwarming film that should leave parents and children smiling._______________________________Ferdinand es una pel\u00edcula animada basada en el libro infantil \"La historia de Ferdinand\" de Munro Leaf y Robert Lawson.
