      "text": "A very convoluted plot, boring stakes, and messy character development make 'Beckett' a pretty forgettable film. The way they try to mix the story with the actual political climate is lazy at best. John David Washington is the least responsible for this mess. Still, I'd be embarrassed, as a renowned actor, to appear in the credits."

      "text": "Thrillers of this kind don't need to be really logical, but at least they do need to have a little more focus, but unfortunately for Beckett, the whole story feels incredibly all over the place.Remarkably dispersed, jumping from one event to another regardless of the lack of cohesion, in a desperate attempt to maintain the suspense, which after a while becomes monotonous, because it doesn't go beyond situations in which the lead character escapes again and again of the dire situations he finds himself in for almost the entire duration of this story.John David Washington can barely hold the lead. I am sorry for him, but his performance is far from convincing, whereas I'm surprised that Alicia Vikander is only there for 20 minutes to be dismissed so quickly.Although it's fair to admit that she has some time without doing something relevant, however, I can't help but feel like she was wasted.I needed it more, but give it a shot, who knows. Maybe you'll enjoy it a bit more."

      "text": "Earlier this year, Netflix pledged to have new film releases each weekend of 2021. I don't know when that was supposed to start, but Beckett was one of its film premieres from last weekend. Beckett is a contained film set in Greece starring John David Washington as the title character with small roles from Alicia Vikander and Vicky Krieps. The synopsis goes as follows: Beckett, an American tourist, and his girlfriend (Vikander), are on an romantic getaway in Greece when a tragic car accident upends his vacation and mires him a political conspiracy that may cost him his life. Here's how I see it.Beckett is an easy watch. If you have seen the trailer, you know exactly what you are going to get; but the way it comes at you is the interesting part. For a movie that is supposed to be a thriller, the first 10-20 minutes that establish Beckett as a character and his relationship seem very disconnected from the rest of the movie, but it's setting up the stakes. Once the plot kicks into high gear, what Beckett goes through becomes relentless - the camera work and music throughout help keep the tension high. In fact, as I watched the movie, I felt like it had some good Hitchcockian vibes. The sense that an unwitting, everyman gets chased and threatened by some overarching government conspiracy sets the essential stage of a taut thriller, not to mention that Beckett is in a foreign country with a language barrier. I could see Beckett as the Cary Grant character from North by Northwest. The problem with Beckett is that the reasons Beckett is being chased make no sense. The explanation is unsatisfactory and wholly forgettable. They probably shouldn't even have tried to explain it. Nevertheless, once John David Washington started running from the bad guys, I was completely engrossed. That was enough for me.Side note: I think this is John David Washington's best performance since Blackkklansman.Beckett is a good thriller that hits its stride about 20 minutes in. The first section is a bit of a slog, but if you make it through that, the thrill of the chase will get you. If you are looking for a decent film with suspenseful elements, you could do worse than Beckett. Grab a bowl of popcorn and enjoy."

All along a little drama!.. I can\u2019t understand why it got so bad reviews, when in the end its not that bad. I would even enjoy a follow up to this movie see what happens next. Did he get back? What was it really all about? This movie is for people who loves the cinema and a good cultural alternative movie"

      "text": "(Mauro Lanari)\"The feeling is that of finding oneself in front of a somewhat gratuitous exercise [...], devoid of a solid staging and capable of withstanding changes in scenery and rhythm, but the project is ambitious and all in all well packaged\" (Roberto Manassero), \"the action envelope is flawless\"(Emanuele Sacchi). Insignificant screenplay aside (Hitchcock, De Palma, Pakula, Pollack: are we kidding?), the expressive form is or pauperistic (a squandered budget for the cast, a John David Washington chosen before \"Tenet\" and a Vikander with an unrecognizable rounded face?) or of a sloppiness which by comparison \"I Cesaroni\" are a proof of professionalism. One is stunned by reading on the credits the names of Luca Guadagnino as producer, of Sayombhu Mukdeeprom his director of photography, of Ry\u016bichi Sakamoto as composer of the score: were they on lunch break, on award holiday for no one knows what? Finally, the title: let's not bother and disturb the Greats without providing justifications."
