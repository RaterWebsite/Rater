      "text": "Surely, a crazed monkey savaged the footage because what is with the cinematography in this movie? It has this unpleasant nervousness about it as it goes from wide shots to extreme close ups and changed angles in matter of seconds. Who films this way? That is something you do to spice up your action scenes or to create tension, not as your modus operandi. This reminds me of that shaky-cam rage that became the fashion some time back so everything was shot that way, even if it was just some guy taking a leak.It gets even worse when boring parts are spiced up with music that is totally inappropriate. Instead of ditching superfluous scenes they just add hyped music to it. Why? Because you ran out of footage?Oh and you know this is going to be bad when, after the opening scene that has Oldman mumble some lines in a church, the movie needs to tell you that the next scene is set in London, the United Kingdom. It was the first and the last laugh. What is next? Berlin, the capital of Germany in Europe? Tokyo, capital of Japan in Asia on planet Earth in the Milky Way? Is the audience supposed to be that stupid?Oh and it has this super frail actress who goes mano a mano with men twice her bulk and a head taller. Can't she not just be smart? Or nimble? Or skilled? And Gary Oldman is in this too. He looks like Jeff 'the Dude' from the Big Lebowski, but mumbles his lines as if he is checked out or wasted. He is doing a Freeman here. I gave this a few points because the cast(except Oldman) does their best, especially the lead. It is not their fault that the rest sucks(and you too, Oldman)."
