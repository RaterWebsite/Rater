The new animation is set in the world of elite dog shows, rife divas, rivalries and slapstick comedy.", "releaseYear": "2022", "mpaaRating": null, "imageUrl": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/bMUhBeMp0vLQzaPBX0izFdnFvh0.jpg", "categories": {"plot": 4.222222222222222, "acting": 5.714285714285714, "ending": 5.0, "soundtrack": 5.0, "cinematography": 5.0, "familyFriendly": 4.0, "funny": 5.25, "action": 0.8}, "reviews": [{"rating": "5", "text": "not the best movie in the world but a pretty good movie for little kids not a very good movie for older audiences though. at least it keeps little kids entertained."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "cut the film some slack, it may not be to grown upsliking but is perfect for the lttle kids. it has its funny moments, whoever does not like this does not have any sense of humour!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "This movie is the best, it's funny, it's just awesome.

C-"}, {"rating": "1", "text": "If you watch the live action Garfield film, you must think \"surely this is the worst film involving a live action animal as the star\"? Not anymore, it isn't Marmaduke is a dull film about a live action dog, where the humour is mainly dancing animals and farting. Oh, and William H Macy getting knocked over. Twice. I know, the film is intended for children, but seriously?Kids like this garbage? I suppose they also like Batman & Robin then The reason I haven't given this film a 0 ratingis because the live action actors, such as Lee Pace and William H Macy, act well, despite the godawful script which could've been written better by two five year olds. They manage to endure the rubbish and act professionally. It's also impressive how many good actors the film got for voice actors. Kiefer Sutherland, Owen Wilson, Christopher Mintz-Plass, Chris Colfer. Must've been paying them a lot. So, if you get to the cinema and find all films but Marmaduke are sold out, go home. It's not worth the admission of the cinema ticket. In fact, it's better for you to take a ten pound note and place it in the shredder. It's more entertaining, has better dialogue and is a better value for money than seeing Marmaduke. I think i'm gonna Marma-puke"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Marmaduke is a good film for young and old. I really enjoyed it because of the cute dogs and funny storyline. Yes, it is not perfect, but it's good for what it's for and it is a big selling film. And you have gotta love Mazie and Marmaduke's cute relationship, haven't you?"}, {"rating": "0", "text": "What do you expect with one of those live action films with people voicing animals? Do you think it's great?why no, it sucks. As far as I know, all movies like this suck."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "If Gabriele Muccino's \"Seven Pounds\" was a single-panel comic, and not a tear-jerking movie starring Will Smith, Rosario Dawson, and a Harlequin Great Dane named \"Duke\", maybe the strip would resemble \"For Better or For Worse\", the award-winning slice-of-life comic strip by Lynn Johnson, known for its realism, in which characters aged and sometimes died, like the Patterson family's sheepdog Farley, who drowned while saving four-year-old April. In one conjectural edition of a \"Seven Pounds\" strip, the caption might go something like this: \"Great Danes live only for seven years,\" as accompaniment to an illustration in which Emily tells Tim about Duke, while they all sit contemplatively in the long golden grass of an open field. These gentle giants are fragile creatures, susceptible to gastric dilatation-volvulus(aka bloat), a stomach condition that's characterized by overstretching due to an accumulation of gas, a potentially fatal malady which can be exacerbated through overexertion. Marmaduke(voiced by Owen Wilson), a Kansas hayseed new to the west coast, uses dogs; in particular, uses Maisy(voiced by Emma Stone), who helps the great dane court Jezebel(voiced by Fergie), a pedigreed collie(shades of \"Some Kind of Ruff-derful\"), as he climbs the social ladder, and in return, discards this motley assemblage of curs without any compunction for their feelings. In actuality, hanging out with purebreds is advantageous for Marmaduke, independent of the cachet that goes along with being popular. Like juvenile delinquents who lure you into bad decisions, these mutts encourage the great dane to expend himself on a kinesis-based video game called Dance Storm. While Marmaduke can recognize himself in the mirror, and TALK, he lacks the anthropomorphic capacity to discern his own mortality. On the other hand, as the conquering alpha male at the dog park, Marmaduke lounges around on a pedestal. It's not snobbery; it's survival. Arguably, the mongerels are a bad influence. Even worse, Phil Winslow(Lee Pace), the dog's master, forces his pet on a longboard, and enters him in a surf contest. It's no wonder that Marmaduke is flatulent. Played for laughs, the dog's farting is probably a symptom of bloat. Marmaduke is dying."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Anyone who expects good out of a movie with half-baked effort CGI, rich Californian setting, and Chihuahuas deserves this.

The characters are completely believable, the acting is superb, especially Owen Wilson, and the directing is some of the best since Stanley Kubrick, heck, even better!

It has some moneys of humor, but its a flick mainly for younger ones. It has an overload on potty humor and is bland and very predictable. It's mostly harmless, but not the best family movie."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Marmaduke is one of many CGI Talking Animal movies.
