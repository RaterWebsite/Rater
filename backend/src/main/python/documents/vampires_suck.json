It's terribly made. It gets pretty gross. Some parts are casted well and some aren't. According to my movie-watching partner, it covers many Twilight events, but doesn't put them in the right order and makes some stuff up. Now for the comedy:\rSome parts were genuinely pretty funny, to be honest. A few things made me laugh and would've been funny in any context (that is to say, some jokes didn't even really need Twilight spoofing as a vehicle). I chuckled sometimes and my companion found it hilarious. But when some jokes rely on changing a couple letters in a name, you start to wonder how clever it really is. I'd honestly have to give this movie a 6, since it was sometimes funny, but was badly made and disgusting sometimes."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Yet another Cinematic excretion from the pair that brought us other such NON classics as \"Meet the Spartans\" and \"Disaster Movie.\" And in a year or so they intend to bring out \"Anime Movie\" A tremendous waste of time and money, you just have to wonder, why do 20th century fox continue to pay these people?"}, {"rating": "0", "text": "WORSE PARODY MOVEI I'VE EVER SEEN. Waste of my time and money. The parts that were suppose to b e funny weren't even close to being funny.

They prefer fluff and stuff that big studios throw out of their faces with little thought, that's briefly entertaining and normally only high quality 10% of the time. So, when deciding what movies to go see with them tends to be an argument.  How they talked me into watching Vampires Suck is beyond me.I've Seen Epic Movie, and that was bad. I then reluctantly saw Disaster Movie. As every other critic said, that was exactly what the title said. So, seeing another Friedberg-Seltzer movie was not foreseen in my future. While normally when I'd see movies with friends, even If I knew they'd be awful, I'd stick it out for them. I tried to do so here, but it was near impossible. I couldn't think of many things good at all about the hurricane ravaged town of a movie I sat through.Nearly all the gags fell flat for me, whether it be the same old \"Reference something famous to get a laugh\" shtick or new attempts by the duo at simple gags (Like an unfunny cactus gag). I laughed about once during the movie, and that's when the guy in the wheelchair got beaten up (Ironic, as I was the only one laughing and I was the one in the wheelchair).Even what could have been nice saving graces, Ken Jeong of the Opus called Community and Diedrich Bader (An abused, guilty pleasure favorite comic of mine) did nothing important to save the film. The only thing that saved this steaming pile of awful was progress for the two directors. After being literally mentally assaulted by the stupidity of Disaster Movie trying to be funny, Vampires seemed to be less lazy, as they genuinely seemed to try to entertain the audience.But then again, maybe I'm not the one this movie is aimed for. My friends enjoyed it, taking it as stupid humor (I prefer my stupid humor smarter, which is a little bit of an oxymoron, from movies like the underrated Hot Rod)...and if you enjoy blatant pop culture references and lame gags...you may have found your movie."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "This movie is horrible.

This so-called spoof/parody from the small minds behind such terrible \"movies\"; Date Movie; Epic Movie; Meet the Spartans; Friedberg and Seltzer should not be allowed pens or cameras. I feel sorry for spoofs like Airplane, Spaceballs and Naked Gun plus many, many more films that while been silly; and they are very silly; have great actors, great scripts that make sence to the audience and are most importantly funny. That is the biggest flaw of Vampires Suck it's stupid and not funny.

However despite it being an undeniably bad film Vampires Suck is not as pain inflictingly bad as Friedberg and Seltzers previous spoofs such as Epic Movie, Date Movie and arguably the worst movie of all time Disaster Movie.

It's not outstanding, but definitely slightly above average."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "The latest parody from Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, Vampires Suck, takes aim at an obvious target that anyone could get some laughs out of. As a result, it manages to be better than the previous efforts by the movie-making team to date. However, that certainly doesn't mean that it is good by any stretch. Friedberg and Seltzer still fail to understand how to make the comedy work and instead populate their spoof with dated pop culture references, cheap toilet humor, obvious jokes and a few examples of horribly bad miscasting. There are many potential jokes to be had with source material like this to riff on but the script instead harps on the same things again and again which results in an irritatingly one-note spoof that fails far off the mark. This may not be Meet the Spartans level of bad, but as you might have guessed it's certainly not worth your time."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "I don't get it. Spoofs are supposed to be stupid. The movie was really funny, but the movie was bad. However, the acting is funny, and is eerily similar to the Twilight Saga. However, it's not one of the best spoofs I've seen. I recommend it for anyone who's ready to laugh, but only go if you know some or most things about the Twilight Saga."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "It is of my opinion that this film has been gravely misunderstood by the majority of critics and the general public.They didn't understand the hidden sardonic wit that satirized the very heart of the corrupt film industry, under the veneer of **** fart jokes.They couldn't accept a film that was so daring as to parody the critics themselves, and as we all know too well the critics hold the power in the film industry.So the critics responded to it in the way we have come to expect of such dogmatic fools. They simply exercised their sheer brutality, and thoughtlessness by rating it so badly.Like so many others before it, this film will be shunned by the general public. Delegated to dying video rental stores and late-night re-runs, it will be known for it's true genius by only a select few.It is an unfortunate scenario, but not one we are unfamiliar with.

Overall, it's dumb, stupid, and retarded. But it's also hilarious!!"}, {"rating": "0", "text": "What was Bella thinking on the night she almost became a woman? \"Vampires Suck\" goes behind Kristen Stewart's inscrutable stare, as the film copies(a real film pays homage) the scene in which Bella and Edward share the night together, when Bella's counterpart Becca(Jenn Proske) verbally expresses what Stewart can only intimate with her soulful eyes, what Bella the Vampire F****r really wanted to do to the fairest Cullen of them all. In \"Eclipse\", the bedsprings go untested, as Bella listens to Edward prattle on about chaperoned strolls and iced tea on the porch, in which the vampire's antiquated notions regarding courtship, for my money, is far funnier than any of the comic bits that spoofs the insanely successful \"Twilight\" films; the \"Star Wars\" for girls. When Mel Brooks satirized the legendary space opera trilogy back in 1987, some people wondered if \"Spaceballs\" arrived too late. Relevance is obviously not an issue here. With \"Vampires Suck\", it's a matter of being too soon, since episodes four and five, so to speak, are both in their various states of gestation. Why couldn't the industry allow Stephanie Meyer's legions of fans the luxury of loving Bella and her fetish for interspecies guys a little while longer without having to desmysitfy the romance for them? Why make them feel stupid? Team Edward and Team Jacob, in the midst of breaking the fourth wall, fighting among themselves at the film's outset to reflect the pandemonium surrounding the fantastical men in Bella's charmed life, should break the wall further by converging on the filmmaker for making such a witless and insulting film. A glittering, pasty-faced vampire and an Indian afflicted with a serious case of werewolf gigantism are no laughing matters for the true believers. And even if you were against the team expansion of 2007(the release year for \"Twilight\"), when Edward and Jacob joined the filmic league of monsters, these lame ringers are no match as objects of ridicule when compared to the sight of Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "This is the result of some bad directing, bad actors, bad lines, bad story, bad jokes, bad graphics, all combined together.
