This movie failed on both counts. The doomsday world scenario and flashbacks needed more spoken explanation. The Arctic/Spaceship needed less. Do we have to have the \u201clead character walks though and introduces the quirks of the supporting cast\u201d scenes? - Even in 2049, I highly doubt every computer screen looks like a videogame. - Why do you have to perform one function at one computer terminal, and then a different function at a different one? In fact, with super-Alexa, why do you have to use a screen at all?- How have we solved faster-than-light communications? I know it makes for difficult movie making but just make it a plot point instead of OMG SUNSPOT INTERFERNCE or REBOOT TEH COMMMMZZZ. - No way a crew that large just \u201cnotices\u201d that they\u2019re off course, especially when they\u2019re out of communication. It would be all hands on deck 24/7.- No way a crew that trained would not know where they were. There are stars out there, for Pete\u2019s sake. - The young Iris plot line seemed super-contrived, and the initial scene with the mother looking for her not-Iris daughter with the pronoun game really felt in retrospect like something they tacked on due to audience response. It was vaguely sixth sense, but in that case, both the protagonist and supporting character are in the same state, so it makes more sense. In this world, his level of interaction with Iris was too physical. Like the peas. The peas. Don\u2019t tell me to give peas a chance. - I\u2019m sure in 2049, nano-carbon technology makes it so you can have swooping gorgeous honeycomb structures with no purpose in a short-haul spaceship. - Also in 2049, you can receive a fatal injury in your spacesuit and not feel pain?

The ideas are just bland, nothing fresh. The background story is not explained, just some apocalypse with not real details. The characters are boring. Very US focussed characters as well. Global apocalypse but all computer screen displays focus on north america. The plot resolution is also terrible. Just tell the crew to turn back to the new planet. To do what? 10-20 people cannot found a colony, especially not when half the movie echoes \"the colony ship didn't make it\". Kind of hillarious. The first scene when people get evactuated basically tells \"We wanna die at home\" and the main character fights so his daughter may die \"away from home\"...Do not waste your time.

Director Clooney has staged the film with wonderful visuals and effective performances, but his dedication to the \u201cdrama\u201d leaves too many dull quiet moments.

K-23 is an Earth-sized, Earth-like moon of Jupiter that took centuries longer than all other Jovian moons to be discovered, and it still is unnamed. The disaster than befalls earth is also never revealed nor are its properties sensical enough for the user to suspend disbelief. Why are the crew not preventing a pregnant woman from carrying out an extremely dangerous spacewalk?

The background story is extremely shallow, the explanation about the fate of the earth is barely touched, characters need more context, it has weak dialogs and it feels a bit slow.

The actors deliver a good job and Clooney really immerses himself in the character.Good camera work, good cgi, colors. It's a very beautiful movie.In the end, it's a sci-fi drama with some action scenes and I found it interesting. If you like space, go for it, it's not remarkable but it's entertaining."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A scientific base in the Arctic is being evacuated due to a global catastrophe in the mid-21st century. Only the astronomer Augustine Lofthouse (George Clooney) remains, who later discovers a girl who had not been evacuated. In parallel, a manned ship from a planet near Jupiter is returning to Earth, ignorant of the catastrophe that is devastating it.Clooney's new film as a director is a real challenge to the new average taste of the public, which is why it is coming under heavy attack from it. He incurs several \"sins\" that the current average viewer does not forgive: his pace in general is slow (the now much reviled slowness), there are aspects of the plot that he deliberately does not explain (and that in this way become more ominous), his pessimism is evident, he avoids underlines and its end is misunderstood by many. Its conservative and more conventional aspects, which have to do with a certain occasional sentimentality and the central place that it gives to family ties are curiously overlooked.On the other hand, given that Midnight Sky in its own way pays tribute to the science fiction cinema \"with a message\" from before but ultimately privileges, with certain licenses, science fiction (let's not forget that Clooney starred in the Solaris remake) also receives hits criticism, since it does not reach or propose the degree of psychological, metaphysical or existential depth of its models or of Nolan's delusions in vogue abuse, for example.Augustine is the prototype of a brilliant scientist who has been left alone by neglecting his personal ties, in particular, family members, but who will be loyal to his \"mission\" until the end and luckily saves us transcendent monologues with voice-overs about the same.The film combines a survival on Earth drama with a \"spaceship in trouble\" drama, both of which are very well staged and lavish images of great beauty. We observe elegance and deployment in the design and resolution of technological devices (laboratories, consoles, spaceship), which nevertheless avoid overwhelming. The spikes in tension and action on the ship and on Earth are very well resolved and filmed. There is at least one sequence on the ship that will surely remain in science fiction anthologies.Clooney carries on with sobriety and solvency an aged and sick character, well accompanied by the rest of the cast.In short, an elegant and beautiful film, with great production design but that does not intend to overwhelm, which in its own way defies the current average taste of the public, which seeks to balance the science fiction of adventures and entertainment with the introspective, psychological-existential and with a message and that, in general, is successful in the challenge."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Have you ever heard of the quote \"show me, don't tell me\"? That's what a good movie should do and, despite being based on a novel, that's what \"The Midnight Sky\" does! If possible, try to watch it on a big screen and increase the volume to 11! Seriously, it's visually stunning and it's a shame it didn't come out on the big screen. Initial reviews from both reviewers and critics might have been completely different if it had! Truth be told, \"The Midnight Sky\" is not perfect. I feel this movie would like to be another \"Interstellar\", but it's more like a mixture between \"The Martian\" and \"Gravity\", even though it's far superior to the latter in my opinion. It's a slow burn, the editing can be rough at certain points and it's definitely not great as a whole and the dialogues are so limited. There's not much of a backstory or even a story here! Remember, this is a movie that follows the motto \"show me, don't tell me\" and various aspects are open for interpretation! I actually loved the lack of exposition, the ideas aren't fresh, but the tone and the perspective truly are. Some people might find this process tiring though. Thus, depending on someone's point of view, the characters can either be really interesting and meaningful or underdeveloped.

Clooney has always been all about the elitist Hollywood way of explaining problems, and loves symbolic empty causes and gestures as he showed with his Darfur campaign in the past. The Midnight Sky is overacted, over dramatized and misses the real point about either actual human solutions to eco problems (stopping cuddling and over population for starters ) and makes a Hollywood drama out of surviving a potential disaster, where as reality will be neither Mad Max nor Clooney drama but just tough real problems like running out of clean water, or resources or dealing with all or tech and techno fixes disasters.

They should have removed those scenes where actors just walk around without doing anything and should have filled them with scenes of story explaination.

Felicity Jones is a pregnant astronaut with nothing much to do except worry a lot.
