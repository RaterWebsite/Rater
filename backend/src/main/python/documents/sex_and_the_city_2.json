When Samantha gets the chance to visit one of the most extravagant vacation destinations on the planet and offers to bring them all along, they surmise that a women-only retreat may be the perfect excuse to eschew their responsibilities and remember what life was like before they decided to settle down.",

The selfishness of the characters will make you feel great about how you treat others. The amount of offensive material toward Arabs will make you feel good about your tolerance toward others. The mere stupity of this film will make you feel smart. This is the only accomplishment of the movie (even if it wasn't intended) and the awful jokes, non-likable characters, and just how tasteless the entire production is only furthers this series to its grave. Most men know that they should stay away but the girl friend or wife will force them to consider attending. Ladies, if you really love your man, you won't subject them to this."

      "text": "\"Reading 'Breakthrough: Eight Steps to Wellness' in Abu Dhabi\" doesn't quite possess the same revolutionary quality as the Azar Nafisi memoir which recounted the transformative effect that western literature had on a group of female Muslim students, since Suzanne Somers, star of the \"Thighmaster\" infomercial, is no Vladimir Nabokov, so the deliverance of these women(equally anesthetized by popular cultural just like their western counterparts) is mostly limited to the body, and not the mind. It's a book club comprised of materialistic Islamic fashionistas who end up validating the ill-mannered behavior displayed by these privileged New York socialites, when the middle east-end girls step out of their traditional \"hijab\" attire to reveal the \"haute couture\" fashions beneath like naughty Catholic schoolgirls. Now Carrie(Sarah Jessica Parker) and her gal pals become the role models that they proclaim themselves to be. At a karaoke club, the ugly Americans have the effontery to sing Helen Reddy's feminist anthem \"I Am Woman\", both for themselves as a pointed animadversion of this hyper-patriarchal society, and the local women whom the westerners presume are in need of some consciousness-raising and enlightenment, without understanding that the mobilization of feminist-minded Muslim women may have deadly reprecussions from their oppressors. Samantha(Kim Cattrall), the ugliest American of them all, not only offends the Abu Dhabi men, but the women, as well. In a very public arena, Samantha's demonstrative canoodling with her latest conquest, proves to be an affront to the female bystanders' inherent modesty, which is derived from a sheltered upbringing that deemed such forwardness as justification for an \"honor killing\". To some Muslim females, the headscarf and veil are personal choices. In Diane Crespo and Stefan Schaefer's \"Arranged\", the principal of a Brooklyn middle school denigrates a young Muslim schoolteacher's traditional apparel choices, and offers her shopping money for designer clothes. It never occurs to the culturally biased educator, or \"Sex and the City 2\", that some Muslim women, like American girls who exploit themselves sexually on their own terms, adopt the \"hijab\" without the stigmatizing effect of Koran-sanctioned female subjugation, in which both forms of self-debasement are post-feminist, but nevertheless, subversive acts of emancipation."

Carrie is married...and whiny. Miranda is bullied...and whiny. Charlotte is a mother...and whiny. Samantha is old...and whiny. get the picture? so they take a cathartic trip to...wait for it...the middle east. where the heat is oppressive and the women simply oppressed. stuff happens, the girls complain, a LOT, they drink a LOT, they spend a LOT. it's as if your best friend becomes a different person you don't recognize anymore. sorry girls, I'm done. i don't want to know what comes next, I'm no longer intrigued. because you are no longer intriguing."

Oh - wait, YES IT WAS! That's what the whole bs is about \"smart women, independent, blah blah blah\". Well, Sex and the City 2 is one of the most insulting films to women I've seen in a long time.And not just women, but also some specific cultural groups (of both men and women) such as Arabs! I just found it appalling and very annoying.The storyline was decently bad, but the dialogue and the jokes - OMG. WORST FILM DIALOGUE i've seen in a long, long time (as bad as \"Crossroads,\" if not worse).Literally, the only reason why I gave it a 2 and not a 0 is the fact that Samantha is as good as always and there are some really hot guys to look at. Otherwise, this is a headache. Horrible, horrible film."

The characters are not laughable,there are many subplots,and why oh WHY do we have to go over with lots of problems with these ladies? Like boring stuff in issues with their relationships and there plenty of more that is far over the top. And of course they have lots of racism and too controversial when the girls are having a break at the Middle East. It's almost as bad as the Transformers 2 and I'M NOT KIDDING RIGHT THERE,they even more racism like this. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING???

You want to enjoy it, but it just blows in your face over and over and over again. It's just too much. It's over-done, over-the-top, just like the wedding at the very beginning of the movie. It's over-produced and over-thought. It lacks carelessness and ease, not to mention it crosses over to ridiculousness one too many times. It doesn't have the wit and the smarts the original series had, and you can't find anything in common with Carrie - once always broke because of her shoe addiction, now living in luxury. Before, she couldn't afford to have her apartment renovated, now she's owning two and flying out to Middle East without a blink of an eye. I'm giving it 10, because when you peel all that off - the bad script, the over-produced schemes and the horrible product-placement - you kind of get what the producers wanted to do. There's a good, honest feeling of wanting you to feel entertained there - to leave the cinema with a smile on your face."

The film is riddled with so many over the top sexual innuendos its almost child like that they would think the audience is that stupid.  \"Lawrence my Labia\"   The middle eastern stereotypes were offensive and awkward it was almost like this once smart comedy stepped down and degraded down to a kindergarten level of writing and acting.

The movie showcases lots of clothes and Dubai, one of those Arab sheikdoms with lots of oil & lots of sand & not much else. Dubai obviously financed most of this film. The sheiks didn't get their money's worth because the Hollywood Jews included the Muslims' oppression of women in the story line. That's the only worthwhile point made in this movie."

Yes, it has some eye rolling moments, but this movie is pure escapism similar to old movies from the 30's, 40's, and 50's.  I laughed a lot at this film, and the scene where Charlotte and Miranda talk about parenthood in the bar is one of the best dramatic and funny moments in cinema this year.  Also, I don't think these critics were true fans of the original HBO show.  That series definitely had some silly moments as well.  I don't think the movies have been that different from the TV show.  I hope they make more sequels!  There!  I said it and feel EXHILARATED!"

The dvd cover for this movie has actually photo-shopped Kim Cattrall so much I actually thought she'd been replaced by another actress. Were they blind? Now Carrie is meant to be a fashion icon and the first pair of shoes we see are garish brash sequined FAIL heels. Then she's wearing a hideous tiara with crimped hair - again someone was blind. Liza Minelli covering Beyonce Single Ladies was just absolutely woeful and sad. Sam's first sex scene lives up to the hilarity we expect and is the first good scene. The soundtrack for when they arrive in Abu Dhabi was the Stargate Movie soundtrack which was a tad wierd as I kept expecting the SG1 team any minute now. I didn't see this as insulting to Muslims as others have commented. It was four wealthy American women experiencing complete opulence in Abu Dhabi so it seemed ok to me that they didn't know much about the place, the people, the culture...  They didn't actresses justice in this movie, using camera angles, lighting and make-up that made them look old and tired. Miranda and Charlotte really took a backseat in this movie which was a shame. There were a few laughs but not as many as we've come to expect."

It was based in a form of reality that many women experience on a daily basis and put it on the small screen for the masses to see.

I definitely would have liked to see more of the City featured in the film. I would have loved to see more Aidan, more Smith, and more Stanford & Anthony post-ridiculous wedding (I was not a fan of the Liza Minelli performance). The scene with Miranda and Charlotte bonding over mommyhood was the best scene of the movie by far. I could have done without the many braless nanny scenes (seeing those things bouncing around once was enough), the karaoke scene, and Carrie had way too many ridiculous puns and whiny moments. Charlotte was also pretty annoying... since when does this confident woman not trust her loving husband?? Samantha and Miranda were the best characters in the flick by far. Kim Catrall is absolutely hilarious, and I was happy to see Cynthia Nixon having a good time being Miranda again.
