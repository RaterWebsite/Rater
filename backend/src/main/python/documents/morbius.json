      "text": "To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Morbius. The conflict and charcacter development is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of classic English dramatic literature, most of the weight of the scenario will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Michael\u2019s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these scenes, to realise that they're not only humorous- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence, people who dislike Morbius truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the depth in Morbius\u2019 quote: \u201cI am Venom.  Just kidding, I\u2019m Dr. Michael Morbius at your service.\u201d which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Jared Leto's genius wit unfolds itself exclusively on the cinematic screens this April 1st. What fools... how I pity them"

Although it does not achieve a perfect hitting on all cylinders, the faithful attempt at showcasing dark elements of a blood thirsty creature pays off well. The CGI occassionally gets into the trippy zone where the effects are heavy warranting a better creative direction or polishing. Apart from that, this is a cbm that delivers and offers a blast for those nerds who are into the sinister six comics. The post credits scene only add to the excitement with subtle references to MCU but still largely in the Marvel universe under Sony and which I honestly think needs further world building."

The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in \u201cadvanced\u201d countries."

If one wants to blame someone - Disney must be blamed for putting their hands on Spider-Man after the initial 6-movie deal with Sony. Regarding the movie itself - the story wasn't much gripping but for the first depiction of an anti-hero it was just okay - not too boring to fall asleep, but not thrilling either. There was good acting from Jared Leto and Matt Smith. The best part of the movie was nice looking and eye-catching cinematography. The visual effects were decent, not too bad - satisfying. Brilliant music throughout the whole movie. The 3rd movie of the Sony's Spider-Man certainly is worse than the previous two, but overall it was a good watch."

And although it keeps most of the vampire blood-sucking gags, it's dark, not cheesy, and a good sideshow to sink your teeth into! Now, on the other end, the so-called critics and people that get drunk off of defiling art by talking about the CGI but, obviously, never skimmed through the comic - should be ashamed to know that Sony did the right thing by implementing Morbius's purple hue within his rapid motion. It is purposefully, not \"cheap\" or \"lazy\" animation! You can always tell when a student comes to class and didn't do the homework but pretends to act as though they did. In today's world of quick Google searches, you got phony professional or amateur critics that draw deductions on emotions rather than putting in the arduous hard work. It's such an oxymoron to refer to the animation as \"cheap\" and \"lazy\" without knowing the historical art style of the comic. It's always those who never do their homework that grossly chastises what they know little about. It psychologically proves that these very people are not only toxic and untrustworthy but live a life of lies."
