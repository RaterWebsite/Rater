Never, ever, in all my days, have I seen a movie so reckless in it's portrayal of history. The first problem the movie contains is a lack of any recognition of Slavery in America. The main character is based of a revolutionary hero who, owned, raped and killed his slaves as he wished. In fact American Slavery is completely ignored and the arrogant slave owning masters are now British... Just bizarre. The second problem lies in the portrayal of the British Army as Nazi's. A war crime is created (the burning church scene) in order to paint the British as monsters. This event did actually happen might I point out, in 1944 by the Nazis against a French town, literally making the British Appear as Nazis! People do take away lessons from movies and the blatant Anglo-Phobia and rampant lies this movie sells, in a shocking attempt to shove propaganda down your throat, making me feel physically sick.I mean the battle scenes were good I guess so 10/10"}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Roland Emmerich saw Mel Gibson's \"Braveheart\" and what did he do? He thought the US should have its own Braveheart and called Gibson to help, giving him the lead role. This film begins badly: as I had occasion to refer to when I reviewed \"Braveheart\", Gibson's film is terribly bad as far as historical accuracy is concerned, however appealing and cinematic it may be (and it is, its undoubtedly epic). This film is unfortunately not better, at least historically and with regard to the English, who are portrayed in an almost insulting way. Okay, there are atrocities in war but everything has limits, and the British still had, at this time, a mentality very much for the gentlemen's war, at least the officers. I accept the argument that its fiction and not a documentary, but even if it is, it should respect more its historical background. I believe that many Englishmen did not accept the way this film portrayed their army. Despite this, the film has some historically correct details, as is the case with all the well built and elegant colonial settings and the costumes, in particular the military uniforms. The way the soldiers fought, quite formal in its essence, is also historically accurate. As a piece of entertainment, the movie works well. The epic way it was designed is nice, looks great in movies and even on TV. It has an extraordinary soundtrack by John Williams and cinematography, colorful and vivid, looks great. I also give a word of praise to the actors, Mel Gibson particularly. This actor had an interpretive tone very similar to what he kept in \"Braveheart\" but without that horrible fake Scottish accent. Here, Gibson seems more at ease with his character, a man seeking personal revenge in the midst of all the conflict he engages in. Heath Ledger, still young, also gives serious evidence of talent. Joely Richardson and Tom Wilkinson met what was expected of them, even though their characters did not require much. Jason Isaacs gave life to the villain and, although his character is not credible at all, he can be very sadistic and scary, showing the cruelest side of the war."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "Director Roland Emmerich plus music by John \"The Big Schmaltzy\" Williams plus screenwriter Robert Rodat (Saving Private Ryan) plus Mel Gibson equals Overblown Hollywood Wanna-Be Epic\r There was so much slow motion in this film that if the director had shot the scenes in real time, this 2 hour and 45 minutes of torture would have ran (mercifully) about 12 minutes."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "I can't believe people think this is good.

Some outrageous moments that are so hard to swallow, and are obviously designed to tug at the patriotic heart strings of Americans. The dialogue was horribly written and so obviously scripted you could tell even the best of actors were struggling to deliver it convincingly. Almost no attention is paid through the entire movie to fleshing out the characters beyond a bit of their back stories and roles in the film. Heath Ledger is completely wasted in this thing, and Mel Gibson delivers the same bland performance as he does in any other movie; in fact during an ambush scene in the forest, I had trouble telling his character apart from the trees, his performance was that wooden.The movie relies on so painfully obvious set ups, story twists and cringe worthy cliches, that it makes you want to stop the movie so you can go to the bathroom and vomit. A complete disservice to the memory of the Revolutionaries. Congratulations, George Washington, you and your men's cause has been boiled down to a pathetic, cliched, pandering, unconvincing, shocking manipulative excuse for a film.

This movie is seriously way too violent & bizarre."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Okay so I know what people are thinking if I was going to review The Patriot when they're thinking about the Steven Seagal version of The Patriot which has nothing to do with historical Revolutionary War. Mel Gibson gained on Braveheart before this came out. Why did I say that? It's because the battle scenes are similar. Hey, I haven't seen it I just know it. Mel Gibson plays Benjamin Martin the veteran of the French and Indian War and a widowed father of seven children. He refuses to go to war but his eldest son, Gabriel played by Heath Ledger goes to war to join the Continentals against his father's wishes. Colonel William Tavington played by Jason Isaacs and his army of British redcoats arrive to the house, captured Gabriel, Thomas tried to stopped them but is shot dead by Tavington calling him a stupid boy. So when their house got burned down, it's up to Benjamin to take down the redcoats. He and Gabriel joined up with his army of friends to take down a bunch of British redcoats once of for all to protect their family. So it's not that long for an epic war film but it does have some slow-paced moments that do fit for some part. As much as I enjoyed most of the action in the war it gets bloody. What people like especially women is the costume design. But there's only one scene that got to me in tears is where Benjamin's daughter, Susan telling him not to leave and she'll say anything he wants but he promises her he'll be back. That scene gets me anytime it gets emotional. I'm not gonna lie, it really did get me. Years ago this is something I checked out before I checked out the Lethal Weapon films now that's saying something 'cause I said before that Mel Gibson is one of my favourite actors of all time. I know there are people out there who don't really like the movie mainly because of it's antics of the American's hatred on the British and the Britain's hatred on the Americans especially when those redcoat b*****d's murdering innocent people, destroying their homes and families. But I'm not one of those people who hate this film, I liked it. It may not historically accurate but it is a fantastic war film with some good cinematography which really made the film look real in the war. Actually I heard somebody in the film mention the word \"accurate\". Mel Gibson, his character said it and the second time somebody else said it. Well, that's just the fact. I'd say give it a watch if you haven't already."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "I liked how this movie showed some guerilla tactics against a Goliath of an enemy and also how to counter it.

Was suprised it didn't fare better on release and with the critics back in the day but for my money its worth a watch for the cheesy feel good factor alone! Jason Isaac's Tavington ia almost as special as Alan Rickman's sheriff of Nottingham.... almost...."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Although it is very cheesy and melodramatic, it's still a solid movie. The acting is great, the cinematography is beautiful, the fight sequences are quite spectacular and despite it's rather long running time, it still manages to be entertaining all the way through. If you're looking for a good, historical, war drama you will probably enjoy the movie."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Basically this is a weaker version of Braveheart adapted to the American Revolutionary War. If you do not believe me just make a comparison from characters, motivations and story arcs. It is the story of Benjamin Martin played by Mel Gibson who is a former soldier who is dragged into the Revolutionary war by dire circumstances and with this also the story of the war and struggles. Within. While the character is fictional I learned recently that he is also a mixture of historical characters. Again it is the Hollywood version of events full of emotion, glory and black and white morality. The truth is less nice but never point this out to US citizens as it is glorified and nearly a dogma. The reality was grim as there is no glory in war and both sides committed horrible crimes (which is a textbook definition for war by itself). However this is an entertainment movie and not a documentary so for me it does not influence my rating. I am not sure if it is as intense and emotional for non Americans as me. To shorten it the movie uses all the techniques to get immersion like Braveheart. This is show not tell, giving emotional impact, make the bad guys (enjoyable) evil, great scenery and breathtaking battles. However I think they have overdone it as there is to much pathos, patriotism and melodrama. It weakened the experience as it gave sometimes a disbelieving feeling that got me out of the immersion. There is nothing for me to criticize for the actors. The cast is well chosen and delivers their roles. I will praise Mel Gibson and Jason Isaacs as best performers in this movie. Both accomplish each other as their respective antagonists / nemesis. There are also some good jokes sparingly used in the movie. The main question that remains is why does this movie not work as good as Braveheart does? For me it is mostly that they overdone some aspects and we have seen it done better in other movies (The Braveheart comparison and similarity did also not help). Maybe Roland Emmerich is not as good as director too but I must remark that I see also no serious mistakes. Overall it is enjoyable but fast forgotten movie."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Cliched to the max but still undeniably likable due to Emmerich's sound direction (the only time I can say that, since his other movies are mostly terrible) and a star performance from Mel Gibson. Heath Ledger also gives a memorable turn as Gibson's oldest son. Sure, the battle between Gibson and bad-guy Isaacs is completely Hollywood-ized, but the end result is absolutely satisfying. The acting is a cut above the norm, thanks to four terrific talents such as Gibson, Ledger, Chris Cooper, and Tom Wilkinson being in the cast, and the result is a well-constructed American epic that deserves a view"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "I'll start with the good things, the scenery, costumes and cinematography are fabulous, the battle sequences are very well staged and the score is wonderful. However, everything else didn't work for me. The film does suffer from a number of things(similar problems I had with Braveheart actually), and the historical inaccuracy is pretty much the least of its problems. This film does distort history, and badly, but it also suffers from too many subplots that prove superfluous in some cases, trite dialogue that make little impact and a truly pantomimic villain played by the usually excellent Jason Isaacs. The direction is nothing special, the pacing is too slow and the film is 10 minutes too long. The acting is lacking too, Mel Gibson tries hard with a very one-dimensional and unlikeable character but he struggles. In fact, only Heath Ledger gives a glimmer of hope and that is because he is the only character you feel sympathy for. Overall, I tried to like it, but too many flaws brought it down. 3/10 Bethany Cox"}, {"rating": "7", "text": "An inflammatory, bloody and well-made picture, where the cast fights against a mound of melodramatic characters and a surprisingly corny-written script."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Emmerich compensates for the fiasco made with Godzilla (1998) with a plot of historical context that at least does not pretend to be totally attached to the mold, combining a filial love story.

I agree that the movie is, at times, far too exaggerated in many ways. I also concede that the movie has many glaring inaccuracies. However, I still enjoyed The Patriot immensely as a film. The acting by Gibson and Ledger is, of course, fantastic. The antagonist, played brilliantly by Jason Isaacs, is an absolutely loathsome scumbag, but in a way that makes you want to keep watching to see what he does next and what happens to him in the end. The film is emotional, intense, and exciting, with loads of adrenaline-pumping action scenes that all have a very real importance to the plot.
