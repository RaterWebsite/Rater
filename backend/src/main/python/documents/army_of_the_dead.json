And while it does not fall totally flat is a far cry from the former.>The Good: Decent production values, plenty of zombie killing, decent if wasted cast, if taken as pure no thinking popcorn movie it entertains, zombie tiger and Its Vegas, baby!>The Bad: Poor pacing overall, feels like a haunted house in zombieland and Snyder can and has done a better job directing before, the casting is textbook diversity woke casting. No zombie Sinatra or Elvis. >The Ugly: Plotholes, so many the Pacific Fleet could drive across it with room to spare, it fails to keep minimal inner consistence too often and ham fisted politics, Sean Spicer, the scummy guard blackmailing and raping potentially zombie infected women and the pretty young woman rock groupie coyote are more unbelievable than the zombies, with such a lazy job of containment it's a wonder only Vegas is overrun with zombies.  >Verdict: Its passable zombie fun, but don't expect too much like me."

But the film doesn't really hit the right notes and bounces between \"fun zombie\" slaughter and \"dramatic humanc slaughter\". The characters don't get enough chemistry together and aren't the focus of the movie. Then Main character is very bland and so is his plot line. And the tone of the movie is all over the place. And all that packed into 140 minutes feels like a lot of wasted time."

Sadly it is just stupidly cliche with a part in which the bad guy (you literally know who he is right after he's introduced) attempts to Kill a latino girl who's John wick with a vagina (literally), she somehow survives just to be killed shortly afterwards in front of her team but still having all the time in the world to scream to them advising who the traitor is, not only that, the guys could've totally saved her by shooting a barrage of bullets (what a stupid scene). Then there's the failed hero daughter who is just a blatant imbecile who condemns the group because she needs to save her friend, everybody dies and finally the second survivor becomes a zombie leaving the perfect cliffhanger for another excellent yet mediocre 2nd flick."

And it just would be an excuse to bring the argument of the genre; there are great mainstream films that aren't as embarrassing as this one, at least when we talk about the plot."

The movie is basically a conduit to craft action sequences and special effects.  They came up with those first, and then tried to build a story and plot around it, and it shows.  Even my fifteen-year-old daughter was offended by the unimaginativeness of the writing.  They didn't even try because they didn't care.  They just wanted zombies and gun sequences, so that's what you'll get."

This solid ensemble cast has us following a zombie outbreak in ye olde Las Vegas. Led by a group of mercenaries, they are up to take the ultimate gamble by venturing into the quarantine zone to pull off the greatest heist ever attempted. I know what you're thinking, \"Zombies, Vegas, and a heist, what more could I ask for?\" Well, let's see what Army of the Dead has for us.I'll put it like this - if I'm going to be a zombie, I'll want to be a zombie like this alpha beast here. Forget any plot, the heist, action and violence is enough to watch this movie. I mean it's violent and bloody like you'd expect from any zombie flick, but it's also got the athletic ability of the WWE and parkour. On that front, it's just entertaining to say the least. Which reminds me, someone really should pitch a John Wick version with zombies. You're welcome for the idea, Keanu.Quiet as it's kept, this is not an original idea at all. I do like the mix of The A-Team, Ocean's Eleven, World War Z, I Am Legend and Extraction put together. It's basically Extraction with zombies. Yeah, I said it, Zack Snyder! You basically just ripped off every movie in writing this flick. Speaking of writing, Dave Bautista has proven that he is a comedic asset and yet this movie lacks any comic relief. In fact, the director portrayed Bautista's character as strong and caring, but BORING. I mean I really think they missed out with Bautista's talent comedically, now athletically they made him look like a freaking animal! Other than that, some characters try to give us some levity, but it felt like the movie was stuck between being serious and a joke. It's either pick one like Shawn of the Dead or be more serious like World War Z and spread out the light moments to lighten the heaviness. It seems like Snyder didn't really know what he was going for with this. I'm not trying t to drive this point home but Omari Hardwick has some range in both comedy and drama, and I feel his character was lifeless until it was too late to save the movie. The zombies had more intrigue than most of the live main characters. While Snyder tried to make the storyline cute and nice and all, it was ultimately secondary to the action.Long story short, I have to get to Las Vegas again before this movie really happens. Army of the Dead has all the typical zombie behavior with a little extra killing and brutality. It's way too long and they didn't really use the cast to the best of their abilities, but the movie provides some solid weekend entertainment. If you like zombie movies, action flicks and tons of heads being shot, check out this bowl of popcorn Netflix joint."

By no means a thinker however. Just decently good actors with good special effects in an above-average, unique concept.

The plot has an interesting premise and the beginning sets it up like it's going to be a fun, Zombielandesque experience with fun kills, over the top characters and a lot of hilarious moments but in the end its a very generic shoot zombie in head...zombie die, repeat, repeat, repeat. The script is laughably bad but I didn't go into it expecting a great script, but with how bad it was it almost felt like a parody. Stupid emotional moments that have no build up or pay off. I mean this movie could have been fun but the amount of time I spent eyerolling over the stupid melodrama I missed half the movie. Instead of making a fun self aware zombie movie, they gave us a movie that takes itself far too seriously and ruins the fun because of it. Id give it a lower score if the premise wasn't kinda cool. I mean Oceans 11 with zombies....kinda dope, does a terrible job executing it though."

If it were the 90's (no streaming services) and it was on TV when nothing else was on, I'd put it on but I'd also lie down and be fine if I ended up slipping into a nap and missed the majority of the movie.On another note, I remember a not too distant past when people cried out about critical reviews being purchased by studios or critics allowing politics to inflate reception of certain films.  Yet now, I can't help but think these same people are destroying the integrity of user reviews.  Sure, everyone has a right to their opinion and everyone has slightly different taste in movies.  However, I feel pretty safe to say that this film does not deserve a 7.6/10 average.  Due to the small number of reviews, I decided to do a little data collection.  Of the 36 positive reviews, 17 scored this film a 9 or 10 out of 10 AND left a review.  Of those 17, six have only ever reviewed this film.  Another five have only reviewed this film and one or both versions of the Justice League (when both, the reviewers gave \"Whedon\" a 0 or 1 out of 10 then the Snyder cut a 9 or 10 out of 10).  So, I think it can safely be assumed that roughly 65% of the written user reviews are Snyder's fans who are still salty about WB moving on from the Snyderverse.  To go further, if you apply that percentage to the count of 36 positive ratings and you get about 23 reviews that are likely overinflated by Snyder Fans, bringing positive reviews down to 13.  This seems far more accurate to me (13 positive, 8 mixed, and 6 negative reviews), probably bringing the user score down to around 5.8-6.3 range.  I think that's a much realistic score if I were to request random people watch this film and ask for their review after the credits roll."

Army of the Dead is pure gore entertainment, with some comedy details. There's no more.It has a few emotional attempts, especially in its final part, but these are unsuccessful and mostly problematic.If we're already involved in the vortex of destruction, carnage and shootings, putting sensitivity affects your film, since, he didn't build something in that tonality in the first part, so it fails to makes sense, and fails to be deep or powerful.It's not much, but it does affect the tone in a bad way, because I honestly never gave a damn about any of the characters involved.And that's a writing issue. Action is the order of the day, although it's nothing special.Let's be honest, this genre in that style has almost nothing to contribute anymore, and Snyder knows it, so he tries to impress you with the scale. It's a great movie for Netflix, and I think it will pay off the expected dividends. After all, this is the kind of large-scale movie that many of its subscribers want. Especially considering the big titles its biggest competitors will release in the remainder of the year.I do not deny that Army of the Dead is a basic film to entertain, but it will not create any subsequent impact, and therein lies everything you have to know about it.This of course, beyond what it will provide you in its two and a half hours of length. The real challenge for Snyder after this would be to make a film that is more practical, and above all subtle."

      "text": "TL;DR - IF Snyder can only step away from his need to try hard at making  thoughtful piece of art every single time, I am confident that he can grow farther than just that director who can shoot action well. Army of the dead is the usual Snyder trying to flip the book on you but fails in the execution making it an empty, unsatisfying and lengthy experience.The GoodSnyder's style of film-making is more often then not always based around cinematography and shot composition. This also always translates into a visually interesting movie with a unique identity in it's look.However, he focuses a little too much on this, usually keeping the story simple works well but AOTD story has quite a few sub plots,twists and turns and unexpected outcomes. This may be a positive point for a lot of viewers as this is undoubtedly snyder firing on all cylinders but this does not always translate well.Bautista caught my attention in the short but great role of the protein farming replicant in Blade Runner 2049, he really made that whole scene work with him showing a great range. He is probably the best part of the movie slowly followed by the rag tag characters who had interesting personalities but sadly it's Snyder any character writing is near pointless he manages to actively make you not care about decently interesting characters.The gore was fun, mixing CGI and practical and the the whole organized/alpha zombies part of the lore was a fun addition to feature-film zombie lore.The BadThis film is such a bag of cliches one after another that you really start feeling the length of this movie. From the trailers it feels like Snyder finally got the point that he makes good action romps that need not take themselves seriously.I went in expecting the same but I got an average main plot with too many under average sub-plots; held up together with a gigantic bag of cliches, all packaged with great cinematography and shot composition.This movie bored the hell out of me, I saw every single twist and turn from miles away and hopefully Snyder intentionally made it so obvious. Because if he really intended to flip the script in earnest he really failed, even the nihilistic angle to it seems half @ssed.Snyder is so hell bent on trying too hard to make a layered masterpiece but focuses on all the wrong things, takes all the wrong decisions with character progression and ends up making movies that are usually unsatisfying, tedious and exhausting to get through. He tries so seriously to make this masterpiece painting but every single decision ends up being generic, forced and thoughtless.All in all if you are a zombie fan you will get something out of this maybe, rather you catch Alive or Train to Busan for more satisfyingly bleak zombie apocalypse settings.If you are not a zombie fan but an action junkie as well you may find that the action in the movie is also scarce and generic."

With all the hype, I was expecting something similar to \u201cI Am Legend\u201d or \u201cWorld War Z.\u201d This movie was a waste of time."

      "text": "Seeing a hierarchical kingdom of zombies is actually kinda refreshing. We have the Shamblers, who are derived from the typical zombies of the late 60s and the 70s, only slightly more evolved and a tad smarter. We've also got the Alphas, who are far more superior to the Shamblers: extremely agile, relatively fast and even capable of showing emotions. Their leader, Zeus, and the one who likely has turned them all into zombies, is quite intelligent and strong. Pretty much a human hadn't been for his gruesome look and his growling and screeching. He's even got himself a queen. The problem is, there's no proper explanation why they retain such human traits, with the Alphas acting and displaying emotions and feelings like humans to the point they come across as zombie imitators. Even worse, that left the hierarchical structure unexplored and unsatisfyingly vague and muddled. That said, I wouldn't hesitate looking past these inadequacies resulted from such half-baked world building so long as they would be offset by the galore of bloody fun expected from an action-packed zombie flick. Sadly, I can't say the movie fully delivered on that either, as the entertainment value is heavily undercut by a plethora of issues including clunky dialogue, one-note characters that are either mere stereotypes or unabashedly ripped off of other action movie characters \u2014 most notably from Aliens \u2014 tonal inconsistency, overly-dramatic moments and, worst of all, a total failure in embracing all of these shortcomings openly in an act of self-awareness of sorts. For starters, the attempts at comedy are awfully bad, with all the jokes falling flat and some of them are just plain cringe-worthy. Ludwig Dieter, the German safecracker who's supposed to be the comic relief character, is unbearably annoying and dumb. The same can be said about some frequent, albeit unsubstantial and tentative, tongue-in-cheek allusions to politics. Needless to say, all the concerns mentioned above have come to the surface and become impossible to ignore. The emotional scenes Scott (David Bautista) share with his daughter Kate are both repetitive and devoid of the slightest dramatic impact, mainly because the plotline revolves around their tumultuous relationship is woefully underdeveloped. Although the movie had its fair amount of time to provide necessary background for its main characters, the bulk of the first act is diminished by poor editing, sluggish tone and unfocused narrative. As an actioner, Army of the Dead is, in fact, quite generic and derivative despite its desperate attempts to conceal that with its skin-deep contrivance, buckets of blood and gore and no skimping on slow-motion moments you'd expect from Zack Snyder. No action scene is memorable or even intriguing enough. Clocking in at nearly two and a half hours, the movie also feels strangely limited in scope, which is not only unusual from Zack Snyder but also at odds with the epic it lends itself to be. That, along with having a kind of a pattern when it comes to switching between humour, action and drama, stifled the tension the perilous zombie territory could've yielded in spades. The fact I dozed off midway through is enough to prove how tedious the end result turned out to be. Even the songs in its endless soundtrack playing rather abruptly didn't help galvanizing the ponderous second act. Honestly, however, the movie picks up in its third act, which is basically one elongated action sequence with the climactic scene being genuinely gripping. Dave Bautista's performance is one of the few redeeming factors here, with some schmaltzy emotional scenes he single-handedly rendered them watchable. Still, Army of the Dead is a predictable, ridiculously overlong zombie heist movie that tried so hard to be an epic, brainless gorefest but ended up being nothing but a borefest."

The film is comstantly out of focus, Tig Notaro is awkwardly photoshopped into scenes, unpleasant characters like the daughter, the daughter\u2019s friend subplot which makes no sense, etc. The film makes itself difficult to enjoy. Worst thing about it is the cast of characters, they should have cut half of them to focus on a few and make them more interesting. Just very puzzling that with this budget and a good cast (though maybe the cast is not so good, the movie does them no favors), this is the zombie movie Snyder puts together. The DotD remake was great. This is a terrible disappointment."

      "text": "What an absolute stinking pile of garbage. I'm not even gona start on the turd of a script but netflix scripts are 95% of the time terrible & Synder isn't exactly known for it either but at least his movies are stylish & can be fun. This is none of that, it's boring, beyond stupid & no fun whatsoever. Which is a travesty to the genre then any attempt to add heart to the story is seriously wide of the mark, nevermind that you couldn't give a **** about the characters that are meant to deliver that heart.The more interesting characters get little screen time or are killed off quick. Then there is the incredibly annoying daughter character in Ella Purnell who you just want to strangle the whole way through but she dominants the screen time. I really have lost my faith in the movie industry to be able to produce anything of a decent standard, the current standard of writing in particular is frighteningly bad. And we are not allowed have a single movie that isn't saturated with politics no matter how silly the film. So here i am, a life long movie fan that has completely lost his faith in the industry to produce anything of quality. It seems we live in the age of acceptable low standards."
