      "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger heads a gritty group of DEA agents who are being hunted down and brutally murdered. This was written/directed by David Ayer (End of Watch, Training Day) and it's shows off many of his best traits: hard-edged violence, dark dealings, witty banter and tons of testosterone (even in the women). The macho cast creates tuff, enjoyable characters with Mireille Enos (best known for \"The Killing\") hilariously hardcore and against type. The snappy pacing and sharp banter propel this film forward until the last third, which slows a bit before the final blowouts. Still, there's plenty to enjoy."

Every other word starts with either an f or a s, the script is more or less generic. The characters are... lackluster, half of them are killed off before we really knew anything about them other than their partying lifestyle. It did not build upon half of the people we should have cared about. Really the best parts were the opening gunfight and the ending scene where he has finished what he sought after. It was just... not done well... The movie wasn't bad, but it wasn't what it desperately needed to be. I would wait for the dvd/netflix release."

The director tried to cater to the Arnold image but it feels shoehorned into a borderline horror fest thriller like \"Seven\" or \"8MM\".

It's got a pretty entertaining story and a lot of fun shootouts that is guaranteed to please die-hard fans of action. Acting is pretty standard for a type of movie like this, however, some of the actors, such as Terence Howard and Sam Worthington felt a bit wasted, as they didn't get the screentime that they deserved. The most notable performance by far was Mireille Enos, who delivered an unexpectedly sinister performance. Overall, it may be somewhat forgettable, but for what it's worth, it's definitely entertaining throughout and not as bad as people and critics have been saying it is."

Arnold Schwarzenegger may not be the best thing in Sabotage, but this is the best film that he's done in a long time. Sabotage is far more effective than its action-centric trailers have suggested, with the film more a mystery-thriller that actually offers Arnold Schwarzenegger and the cool ensemble a chance to act and not just shoot guns."

Arnold's team might not be the most enjoyable bunch, but the man himself delivers. It's just a shame about all that terrible dialog, the worst of it coming from Olivia Williams character.\r Despite it's hard to like supporting cast and bad one-liners it's an overall entertaining romp. The action is suitably gory and awesome, and despite being fairly obvious the plot is entertaining. Far from the best thing Arnold's done, but he still manages to keep things watchable. Not everyone is going to like it, and it gives plenty of reasons for them not to, but there is still enough to make it enjoyable for Arnold fans or those who like their action movies dirty."

      "text": "Sabotage was a movie was so much potential but ultimately failed to live up to that potential because it had a ridiculous premise. ***SPOILERS*** The premise was that this elite, undercover DEA team attempts to steal $10 million from a pile of what appears to be hundreds of millions of dollars. They then blow up the drug cartel's money (as they were apparently instructed to do by the American government) and upon returning to get their $10 million later on, the money is gone. Now here is where the ridiculousness kicks in. The government and the cartel somehow seem to know exactly how much money was taken and interrogate the team for six months trying to get them to admit guilt. I'm sorry but that would be like a swimming pool draining but someone knowing that you took a cup of water out of it beforehand. It's retarded. Now, normally this type of stuff wouldn't cause me to take a movie with fantastic acting, dark and gritty action, and solid character development down to a 5/10 rating. While I thought the plot development was also crap, the premise ultimately hurts the movie because every single dramatic element and moment of suspense and intrigue in the entire movie is built entirely on that faulty premise. It is a damn shame too because this movie had Miami Vice (reboot) potential."

      "text": "Arnold is back, and at 67 years old he hasn't missed a beat. Sabotage is the Governor's third starring role since returning from his stint in politics, and it's easily his best one to date. Schwarzenegger stars as Breacher, the commander of an elite DEA swat team, who agrees to help his under appreciated team take part in the theft of millions of dollars, from a top cartel boss. The heist goes relatively smoothly, but when the team goes to retrieve their money, they discover that one of them double crossed the rest and had stolen the pay day. Everyone is upset and trying to figure out who it was, when the cartel shows up looking for retribution. As the cartel picks off the team one by one, the remaining members have to ban together to try and stop them, except this time, they have to do it knowing that one of them is a trader. Arnold isn't doing the crazy stunts or fighting scenes that he's become synonymous for, he's in more of a leadership role in this film, but he's still the man when it comes to action films. Here he's paired with the Killing's Mireille Enos, who as the only female member of the team, gives an amazing performance. I'm used to her always playing these quiet, reserved, troubled characters, and it was a real treat to see her break out as the wild girl on a team full of men. Sabotage is the rarest of Action films, as it is one with a great storyline, that is as gripping as any drama. The film isn't just about killing people and blowing things up, it has plenty of that, but in the case of Sabotage, there is a reason for all of it, and this film will really keep you on the edge of your seat."

      "text": "Not expected this from the director. For a title called 'Sabotage' which had one of our times greatest action hero in it the story drags with lots of drama than stunts. Arnold Schwarzenegger is not young anymore and he's not capable of heavy stunts, but still he handled well those crucial parts. No doubt he was good, and also the direction, but the story was not well written. Especially the twist was so pale and the supporting characters were hyped better than the Arnie's, but failed to hold and deliver when the story needed them.\r Due to create the suspense some of the assassins were kept undisplayed for the viewers and that is another let down. Because in the whole movie action sequences were the weakest except the opening scene and those murders were somehow produced expectancy. This movie was not bad, but an average. It can be watched once though it may not fulfill your thirst for fine enjoyment. You may like what I did not, so I can't put it to discardable list.\r 6\u00bd/10"

      "text": "I wasn't aware of this Arnie movie til my girlfriend downloaded it and asked,\"Do you want to see a new Schwarzenegger movie?\" This one was completely off my radar, and maybe it should of stayed that way. Sabotage isn't exactly a balls to the wall action film, there's a little bit of suspense thrown in for those of you new to that concept. Otherwise you've seen this formula before. Team of awesome \"specialists\" gets the blame for something missing/gone wrong, the leader is tossed, teams falls into disarray, leader comes back seeking payback, team gets killed one by one and there's something else, but I don't want to give it away. Trust me though when you see it it won't be anything earth-shattering. This movie falls on the dull side with boring dialog, Arnie isn't known for his acting chops, that mostly consists of cussing and insults. The action though is pretty decent, if you're looking for good gore in a  movie it's here. Firefights are done well and don't seem too unrealistic, although there's one scene that had me and my girl laughing cause the blood looked more like someone dropped a bottle of BBQ sauce on the floor. In the end though it's just a very dull and forgettable movie. Arnold looks very tired in most of his scenes and all the other actors were just not interesting. It's the action in this movie that keeps it from being a total zero, but even those scenes added together only amount to something under 10 minutes. If you can watch it for free give it a go, if you're gonna pay for it pass it up."

This film shows just how pathetically poor his judgment is and calls into question how much luck played in his stardom.  By all inside accounts a very smart guy, so why he is not smart enough to understand how he is needlessly destroying his legacy by doing these tasteless, vulgar, juvenile, depraved, BAD action flicks and how much the audience clearly does NOT want to see him in them anymore is a mystery and a shame.

Instead, like Stallone, he goes for dumb Z grade action flicks and not just blows it but bombs so bad he'll never recover now.

Which you can get away with in an action movie as long as there is a net to fall on like a character that is actually very smart coherent and reasonable or sexy women or clever humor...of which there was none. It was all very vulgar, lowbrow, and just rude. There is only so much of that that can be taken without blemishing the movie. There was a definite guessing game that was kept alive as to who is behind what exactly, with a few holes but nothing too serious. But the end result was just disheartening and bleak. Nothing to hope for or look forward to. It is cool to see the governor getting swole and becoming the action hero we all love once again but its Just a dark movie that isn't really Arnold's type.

Not even saying that the script is that good. In fact it's awful. Horrible dialogue with swears left and right. The amount of foul language and this movie is ridiculous and completely unnecessary. I'm no stranger to foul language, but it needs to be used correctly. For example in Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained foul language was used beautifully. Here it's just there for the sake of being there. Almost everyone in this movie cannot act other than Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sam Worthington. The action sequences are fun and enjoyable. But in that way where it's just amusing to see people blow up and die. There was no real rhyme or reason to it and the action sequences were few and far between.
