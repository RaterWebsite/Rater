  "description": "Quentin Jacobsen has spent a lifetime loving the magnificently adventurous Margo Roth Spiegelman from afar. So when she cracks open a window and climbs back into his life-dressed like a ninja and summoning him for an ingenious campaign of revenge-he follows. After their all-nighter ends and a new day breaks, Q arrives at school to discover that Margo, always an enigma, has now become a mystery. But Q soon learns that there are clues-and they're for him. Urged down a disconnected path, the closer he gets, the less Q sees of the girl he thought he knew.",

This film may not have the huge depth that some other classic teen films have but I think it is going to get some attention sooner or later. There are several really great performances in this film. Natt Wolff looks like he may be destined for a long film career after this film and the whole ensemble cast has such great chemistry and this movie has a lot of unexpectedly good laughs. I didn't find the film too clich\u00e9d. There are a few minor aspects that are a little predictable but I found myself surprised and satisfied in the end. One of the downsides to this film is the absence of Cara Delevingne for essentially the entire second act. Her role in this movie was great but there was just not enough of her in this movie and I hope she was get some attention for this performance."

      "text": "Teen romance is done rarely well, most of the time, they feel cliched, uninteresting, and at times, really pretentious. 'Paper Towns', unfortunately, falls for every one of these cliches, and it doesn't use them ironically.\r Based on the novel written by John Green (who also wrote 'The Fault in Our Stars'), the movie focuses on a young boy named Quentin Jacobsen (Natt Wolff, who was also in 'The Fault in Our Stars') going through his last year of high school, and has found himself infatuated with a girl named Margo (Cara Delevingne), a girl he's known since childhood. She is a mystery as she is fascinated with strange things that he has trouble understanding, and as they're growing up, she, for some reason, disappears and is nowhere to be seen.\r Quentin does everything he can to find her, since they spend one amazing and somewhat risky night together playing pranks on all her former friends as her boyfriend cheats on her. After that night, that's when she strangely disappears for reasons unknown.\r Quentin tries to piece everything together to help him look for her and find out where she is. He tells his idiotic and stereotypical best friends, Ben (Austin Abrams) and Marcus (Justice Smith), two young boys so splashed with low-life stereotypes, I often wonder what's a bland, heartbroken teenage boy like Quentin, doing being friends with those two. Then again, why does Quentin fuss so much about Margo? We don't get to know a lot about her, other than the fact that she is a mystery...but there is nothing else to her character.\r And that is the biggest mistake that this movie makes, Quentin is just your typical, girl-obsessed teenage boy and Margo is just... a girl. His friends are just walking talking stereotypes as one is plain dumb, and the other is of a different race, but in case his skin color doesn't make that obvious, he falls under typical stereotypes that we see, and they're not funny at all.\r The movie just ponders on and on with Quentin piecing together the puzzle to try and find Margo, but I must admit, these characters are so one-dimensional, I stopped caring too early. They may as well have called this movie \"Paper Thin\".\r All the build up also leads to an ending so unsatisfying in its resolution, that I couldn't help but wonder, why is this all worth it? The movie should have had a different ending, that way, at least this wouldn't feel like a waste of an almost two hour movie."

It's funny and touching but it's just another teenage movie in Hollywood."

However, the catastrophic performance from Delevinge was completely detrimental to the already plainly-average final product.\r This film adaptation from the book of the same name revolves around the charming yet mysterious Margo (portrayed by Cara Delevinge) which told from the narrative of the typical invisible high school boy, Quentin (Natt Wolff).\r However, the adaptation changes the form of Margo, with the efforts of Delevinge, which would have been a filmmakers' dream and transforms her into a plain-Jane, hideously acted and overall boring character.\r If the role was based on eyebrows, it would be understandable as to why Delevinge was considered. However, its not and a promising career from the former model will not be anticipated."

Friendship is just one of those parts where you get to know yourself by knowing who you have around, and Quentin and his friends reflect that perfectly.\r Margo is the true sense of reality: sometimes you need a punch in the face in order to realize it, but it is always there in front of you. We all seek for miracles: maybe for Quentin, Margo was one, but in life sometimes you need to be cheated in order to see the truth. \"Every one gets a miracle; you just have to learn to look at it\"."

The story is intriguing and has a very puzzle and mystery tone to it. There were some pretty funny scenes and scenes that made me actually smile, its a mostly uplifting movie. Now lets go over the flaws. The first and biggest one is how hard it tries to be deep and inspirational, its not, its just a fun adventure/mystery movie, nothing deep found here. The second thing is the ending, its not terrible or even bad, its just very anti-climatic. The third and final this is small, but noticeable is that it has the typical nerds end up getting hooked up with pretty popular girls, its so overused and is not needed here either. Overall, its a good movie especially for teens/young adults, but not anything that you will remember a few months from now."

Performances were strong and the film still is a fun and entertaining watch. I've been following Natt Wolf's performances for a while now and my only fear is that he will get type casted as a Micheal Cera kind of actor. My only recommendation would actually be to watch the movie first then read the book after. Overall not a bad movie, but readers may be irritated in the amount of alterations... clearly i was."

I'm not saying it was a terrible movie, because that's not the case, but honestly I think the story in itself was not great. I'm pretty sure I've read this book \u2013 years ago \u2013 but I can't imagine that the story was more involving or emotional than what was shown on-screen.\r I think my biggest problem with the story itself lies within the fact that Margo Roth Spiegelman is portrayed not like a person, but a fascination. A fascination \u2013 almost a toy \u2013 that Quentin feels the need to take ownership of. He thinks she needs to be saved and she is his to save, when the reality is that he shows up unannounced thousands of miles away. That's more creepy stalker than anything. This movie isn't even romantic. It's weird.\r Paper Towns is a journey. A literal journey. Hypothetically that should be ok, let a movie's plot do what it wants, but the physical movement of their minivan moved it along more than the characters. I would rather watch a movie about nothing with characters I would take a bullet for than a movie with a journey across the country with characters that are, ultimately, words on a piece of paper."

This is where the movie really disappointed me and caused me to drop a few points off it's original score, there's a big buildup throughout the movie to the ending and then it happens and you're left thinking \"Why did I just waste my time watching this?\" because, without ruining anything, nothing really happened in the end.

      "text": "\"Paper Towns\" is an unique romantic comedy, that isn't weepy like Green's other film \"The Fault in Our Stars\" but it's satisfying to the fans and gives them a look at unrequited love and bromance. After watching John Green's first adaptation \"The Fault in Our Stars\"  I was surprised that it goes around the cliche's, overall the film moves you and takes you on a powerful journey while it does give you great humor and some astonishing star-making performances and Paper Towns gives us that. The film is yet again written by Scott Neustadter & Michael H. Weber ('500 Days of Summer' and 'The Fault in Our Stars')\rthey know not to mess up the romance formula, but this film does sort of makes mistakes but their good at this genre and they should gives us more John Green adaptations. A teenage nerd Quentin (Nat Wolff) is about to have the night of his life with his childhood crush Margo (Cara Delevingne) the most popular girl in high school it's been a while they talked to or hung out since they were kids. Wants him to help her play mischievous pranks on her friends who had betrayed her. The next day, the mysterious Margo is no where to be found. His buddies Ben (Austin Abrams) Radar (Justice Smith) and brings along Lacey (Halston Sage) and Radar's girlfriend Angela (Jaz Sinclair) are helping Q find Margo. With the help of Margo's cryptic clues she had left behind, Quentin embarks on an obsessive mission to find the girl who he love and has made him feel truly alive. The film is like a John Hughes romantic comedy, like able characters funny humor and a great love story. Director Jake Schreier (Robot and Frank) adds the charm and puts a riveting story on screen with charm and like ability in to it. Nat Wolff does a great job and so does Cara Delevingne, those actors we can do good in the future. The film's problem is that is does get cliche'd at times and the film knows what it wants to be and that is a coming of age drama, it isn't moving but it's earnest and well acted. Grade A-"

According to that individual the book ends with Quentin realising that Margo is not the deep and interesting girl that he created in his own head.\r I don't know if such an ending would have been better but it at least would have been more interesting than the bland ending we got. There would have been some drama with Quentin seeing his illusions smashed. Instead he just realises she doesn't like him. And then it ends.\r Margo was my biggest problem of this film. Besides that, the film was very enjoyable and funny. You really wanted to spend time with Quentin and his friends because they felt real. Unlike Margo who just felt like a character from a children's adventure book.\r Which brings me back to my original point. Margo starts out as the Manic Pixie Dream Girl. By the end she could have become human. But she doesn't. So when you compare her to all the other characters in this film it's like they come from completely different worlds.\r Paper Towns is, overall, a good film but the ending completely ruins the entire story and the themes that it was building."

They changed how Margo acted when she saw Quentin came looking for her. They changed when they leave for the road trip to go find her. They don't give any information on the things that mattered so much in the book. It was really obvious they just wanted the 15 year old girls to be swoon by the actors and their love story so they could bring in the cash. This book means so much to me and I love every page of it. The movie just wasn't what I expected at all. I expected the fact that they would leave stuff out but they just completely changed how things went. Jake Schreier, the Director, really did this story an injustice. I was hoping they would make a movie of Looking for Alaska and An abundance of Katherines but having seen Paper towns, I actually hope they never do. They would just ruin it and make it so that the pubescents love it. I recommend reading the book and staying away from the movie. The actors were perfect, the movie not so much."

I found it difficult to watch his facial expressions and body language to the point where I was more annoyed than uncomfortable. This movie offers a rough 15 minutes of excitement, 20 minutes of emotional scenes and a whole lot of anticipation building up to an ending that leaves you feeling cheated. The first half of the movie had great potential to deliver greatness, but everything after it is just painfully unexciting and boring. As a European person, I find myself being unable to relate to the drama of high-school ending and prom, however most other teen movies did a much better job at getting close. It completely missed what I think was the general target of the movie. Overall,  would recommend reading the book, but not wasting time with the movie.

Yet, it does offer some interesting insights on relationships (both romantic and friends) and has a compelling plot that is fun to follow along with. However, it is aggressively average all the same. The film is decently cast and has the occasional moment of brilliance from a filmmaking standpoint, but is like an agglomeration of every other teenage film ever. Paper Towns tries to get its viewer to leaves their comfort zone. To avoid the ordinary and become extraordinary. Tragically, the film ignores its own advice as it shamelessly borrows from prior coming of age dramedies aimed at teenagers. Even more, the story is largely quite ludicrous and far-fetched (how did these kids have access to this much cash), which also serves to hold the film back. Now, it is quite charming and a good time even it is quite typical. For a film that is largely derivative of past works, it needs to offer something new or just have enough pizzazz and power to overcome its generic nature, but Paper Towns does not do this.

But having differences over how to enjoy the life, they had drifted away. Until when the actual story begins in the final year of their high school. So Q finds some clues when Margo disappeared like usual, but this time he considers it seriously and goes after her to reveal his love. What follows is a road adventure and a mini twist in the tale.\r Great cast, but I think it is the Nat Wolff's best performance as the lead. The supporting roles were not here to just support, but participated beyond the usual. Cara Delevingne was not bad either, but her part was like in and out frequently. So overall it had best set of characters with uniqueness from one another. Which means don't expect a silly teen comedy, it was awesomely designed to impact all generations. So the entertainment is guaranteed.\r It is not just a romance between two, that is what I was surprised. The narration points out a one love story, but in the end you would end up watching a multiple romances. Something very refreshing and all the lines were very matured, which kind of feels like the real world stuff. I really liked the conclusion, proves why one should watch it.

I only gave the book 2 stars so my rating for the movie is adequate with my comparison. I like how the guy at the gas station and Q are both from Fault In Our Stars. I like that little John Green tie in :)"

Paper towns is a movie about love, teenage life, adventure and friendship. The love story part is realistic compare to other Romantic movies. This makes the movie unique and beautiful. It is simple love story not so dramatic or too emotional. JUST enough and JUST OKAY. But this Just enough and just okay make it lovely and great love story. Teenage life, I've been there, We've been there. You will be there. This movie tells about teenager who are both curious about things and insecure. But this brought the adventure part of the movie.  Adventure about real life - school, love, doubts. The friendship part of the movie will make you wish that somehow you will meet the best persons who could be your BEST friends. I'm sure you'll like it. Just feel the movie and try to see it in different angle to rate it 100% . =)"

Les ados ais\u00e9s vont \u00e0 leur bahut, conduits par leur maman, font des projets pour l'avenir (toi, tu seras m\u00e9decin, mon fils) et celui-ci repense \u00e0 sa copine d'enfance de la maison d'en face lorsqu'une nuit l'\u00e9nigmatique copine, Margo, vient toquer \u00e0 sa fen\u00eatre pour aller faire les 400 coups et se venger d'ind\u00e9licats camarades...Puis Margo dispara\u00eet et une enqu\u00eate commence pour le blaireau et ses amis comme pour une chasse impromptue au tr\u00e9sor, car la fille a laiss\u00e9 des indices comme le petit poucet. Le film a le m\u00e9rite d'aiguiser la curiosit\u00e9 et d'intriguer un certain temps tandis que les branques remontent la piste mais cale h\u00e9las rapidement par la suite, faute d'id\u00e9es et surtout... de sc\u00e9nario !La fin est d\u00e9cevante, aussi d\u00e9cevante et banale que leur vie de **** bourgeois bien propres sur eux qui ne pensent qu'\u00e0 tirer leur premi\u00e8re crampe au \"bal de fin d'ann\u00e9e\", la sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 am\u00e9ricano-am\u00e9ricaine qui nous fait toujours bien rigoler... ou lever les yeux au ciel plut\u00f4t.Entretemps, le principal int\u00e9r\u00eat du film, \u00e0 savoir cette \u00e9tonnante actrice aux gros sourcils et au nom impronon\u00e7able que l'on avait vue dans le gros nanar intersid\u00e9ral de Luc Besson, Cara donc, a disparu.

      "text": "A No Heavy Tearjerker, But Still Searingly Relatable and Sentimental !Coming on the heels of its commercially-successful predecessor, 'The Fault in Our Stars', PAPER TOWNS is no heavy tearjerker, but it echoes more affectionate and piercing sentiments, with its lighter, minimalist take of its recognizable subjects.The film follows Quentin (Nat Wolff) , or \"Q\" as he is more popularly called, a highschool boy who has been nursing an unrequited love for the girl living next door, Margo (Cara Delevigne) since childhood. Even after when they turn 12, when Margo suddenly becomes distant, \"Q\" never loses the affection, and it only becomes even stronger when one day she climbs again to his window, the way she did when they were still kids. The next events follow an eager \"Q\" savoring the moment as he escorts Margo in her series of \"small revenge\" against those she thinks have betrayed her, including her ex-boyfriend. But the levitating moment would only last overnight, because the next day, the ever mystifying Margo, disappears.Mining on the same overly familiar material that dwells on both coming-of-age and teenage romance territories, PAPER TOWNS pulls off two easily-recognizable efforts: maintaining 'The Fault's charm, while toning down its tragic notions. The latter of which, yields a more tangible and heartwarming result, capable of conjuring a lasting tug at the heartstrings. The credit for this goes to its equally-charming yet capable actors, both of whom teeming with fresh and enigmatic likability. It will also sound unforgivable to never pay regard to the film's brilliant screenwriters who manage to cleverly highlight this extremely familiar highschool tale's stronger and more relatable sentiments, genuinely and sincerely enough, to bend fragile emotions with crippling capacity.\"Q\"'s road trip in finding Margo represents a bigger journey with far wider scope and meaning, and it comes across as a process of personal exploration that unknowingly liberates one self, toward finding the deeper sense of their existence. Hardly that the questions thrown get resolved, but the charming and sincere take of its proceedings, will ultimately make the narrative arrive to a satisfying conclusion. This doesn't mean it's able to satisfy its own queries, but the resolution delivered are nonetheless, reliable and honest.PAPER TOWNS will come across as a witty, yet touching case of a 'lost and found'. Much of it is spent in searching for the 'lost', a liberating process that frees its seekers from every question that unfolds in the wake of a previous other, but the 'found', though never really answers any of the previous questions, will deliver a surprisingly satisfying, and never less of a rewarding, answer."

But nonetheless movie is quite charming natt Wolff and cara Delevingne did an amazing job as the lead their chemistry really work together but the ending of the movie is quite stupid . I thought that it could have gone any way other than where it went but it was quite enjoyable at times and the runtime of the movie is also quite perfect"

      "text": "It's not a terrible movie, but if you've read the book before, it's gonna be extremely disappointing. See, the characters are pictured quite accurately in the book, especially Margo's, but it seems like the creators were trying to make a lame, high school movie that could be favored by most of the teenagers. So they changed everything they could, even the ending (to some extent)! And it gets even worse when the focus is not on Margo being lost and the relationship between Margo and Q, but on Q's friends instead. Overall, the story is too much altered in comparison with the book; it's changed from a mystery romance with a tiny but beautiful touch of life philosophy into this like-every-other-teenage-movie thing.The only thing I really enjoyed was the soundtrack which I downloaded and listened to while I was reading the book, before watching the movie. If you haven't read the book, you might end up being fine with Paper Towns, but if you've read the book, god, do not go with the movie, just stick to the images inside your brain!"
