If you are about to buy the DVD, you better put the money in your next meal and eat it, because the movie is as senseless as doing that. At least. But eating money more fun."

Just think about it, how many low budget movies have been good. Equilibrium....Follproof. But the second movie...wow....the swimming was even fake. Like common Jason, don't let them do this to you. And for some reason, he can now do anything. He freaking spun his car upside down and knocked of a bomb on the bottom of his car, then landed without a scratch on his car. But one thing that pissed me off the most, was that they didn't have the cool music to set the mood in this movie. The first scene in the first movie compared to the first scene in the second movie....bad. Avoid this movie at all costs."

Jump backward a few feet, and you'll be miraculously unharmed! I found myself constantly groaning at the manner in which the director attempted to move the plot forward. Skip this one, unless it's free and you can get your hair cut at the same time."

      "text": "As Dr. Evil once said, \"Why must I be surrounded by frickin' idiots?\" That is exactly what Frank Martin (Jason Statham) must feel like in Transporter 2. Transporter 2 is the sequel to the 2002 movie about Frank Martin a former Special Ops Agent who is a transporter of sorts who ends up getting involved with people who are in the business of transporting Asian slaves. This time around the child of his temporary employers who was under his care has been kidnapped by a group of people with a need to poison and kill a bunch of leaders evolved in drug enforcement. Just like the first movie, this movie boasts a number of action scenes that range from the insane to the absurd, all of which are completely fun to watch and make the movie completely watchable despite the numerous flaws. Like I said, Frank Martin seems to be surrounded by a host of stupid and incompetent supporting characters minus Audrey Billings (Amber Valletta) and Inspector Tarconi (Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and). It is obvious that Frank and Audrey are constantly frustrated by idiocy of the other characters in the movie. Why? How does a poor script and terrible acting suit you as a good reason? The plot is simplistic, the majority of the acting is terrible, and the writing is full of fail. Even Jason Statham is suck with some pretty weak one liners. Overall, the action scenes alone make this movie worth the time. Some people will find most of the scenes overly ridiculous and will most likely be turned off by them. But ff you are willing to turn off your brain for 90 minutes, you will find this movie enjoyable. If you are looking for a masterpiece, you'll probably be disappointed and should look elsewhere."

      "text": "Once again, we have a Statham movie, where the story isn't the focus and doesn't matter much at all. The allure of this film is the terrific characters created by Luc Besson. The mysterious driver with OCD is back, but is well into his retirement. Instead of helping the bad guys get away, Frank Martin (Statham) is driving rich people around, but he's forced into action when their young son is kidnapped. The story here is somewhat simplistic, but the bad guys are as creative as you will ever see in this type of film. I'm not sure where they found Alessandro Gassman and Amber Valletta, but they were so much fun to watch. He is a self-obsessed drug lord, with ridiculous moves, and big plans, while she is a deadly assassin, whose ability with a gun would put John Wayne and Clint Eastwood to shame. When Statham is added to the mix, you have the perfect formula for one intense movie. Transporter 2 was terrific in that it never stops moving and you will see things you never thought were possible outside of CGI, it was unbelievably entertaining. From the stand point of a film aficionado, while these amazing moves and characters make for a lot of fun, the story and dialogue are severely lacking. This film is not for people looking for a great story or loveable characters, it's made for adrenaline junkies who want to see explosions, long fight scenes, and intense thematic action. If you're all about the action, you won't find much better than this, but if you want there to be some greater purpose, a worth-while cause to fight for, or want to see the world become a better place because of all that happened, you'll be disappointed."
