The camera following behind the actors, almost stalking them, feels like another character.  The music, ominous and sparse, also feels like a character.

In a time where Hollywood studios continue to churn out version after version of the same formulaic tripe, it's a relief to find a film so original in its conception. Everything from the cast to the cinematography was superb. There was something to admire in every aspect of its construction. Clearly, a project that was well thought out and devised with care. The story is certainly unusual and requires some focus and thought on the part of the audience.  Some of the scenes portray a distinct brutality, often painful to watch, but they combine to convey the story in a very compelling way. Disturbing yet fascinating, with wonderful performances from Farrell and Kidman. Barry Keoghan is outstanding as Martin, the psychopathic young man hell-bent on making his father's killer pay.

Everyone cringed at the brutal parts.Unpredictable is the best compliment I can say. I literally had no idea where it was going and kept surprising me with each scene. I'm kinda lost words with this one. This is me still progressing.The score was brilliant. Having this blast of a roar which shook up the room and was really eerie.

The story, gore and a truly eerie performance by Barry Keoghan accompanied by hair-raising music will try its very best to push you to your limits. Going beyond extreme measures to unnerve you, and if nothing else it achieved that no problem. Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, so if you haven't experienced anything by this director before it might be a good idea to prepare yourself by watching The Lobster. This is certainly a director you won't forget, his films are so unpredictable and deeply disturbing you either love him or hate him.At its heart The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a revenge story, so dark and cold everything I like in a film but I found myself very disappointed with it. The monotonous and robotic way all the actors are carrying themselves was the biggest distraction. I couldn't believe anything they were saying or doing as something that would actually happen. As the story reaches some of its pivotal moments none of the characters were responding in a way I believed so I found myself getting more and more annoyed with it. I didn't buy into it at all.\u00a0Barry Keoghan is definitely the stand out performance, he has an amazing on screen presence. Chilling and will make your skin crawl. A modern day Greek tragedy is what everyone loves to call this but don't worry you'll pick up on that analogy soon enough as the movie takes any opportunity it can to remind you that yes this is a tragedy, this whole situation is so unbelievably tragic, how did we possibly get into this unbearable tragic situation.

It's uncomfortable to watch but you will never come to grips with the film if you do not sit through it all the way to the end.  About half way it will grip you and won't be able to leave the screen.

Things get bizarre when the conflict between their relationship and his own family (including wife Nicole Kidman) goes in unfortunate and unexpected directions. The characters maintain the stilted stiffness and minimal emotions that director Giorgos Lanthimos adapted for his first equally unusual film (The Lobster). He also embraces an uncomfortable style, a deliberate pace and an eye for eccentric vantage points. There's an unnatural discomfort that pervades the film and it only accelerates as the unfortunate circumstances progress. The abrupt and intrusive music exacerbates the movie's determination to make the experience uncomfortable. Some watching this prolonged, painful, somewhat pretentious process will appreciate the appropriately weird approach."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Quite a boring film.

However, with that being said, this one is certainly much, much darker and sinister. I certainly enjoyed the deadpan delivery and performances, as well as the haunting score that made both films strangely unique and intriguing to watch. However, this film lacked a bit in terms of imagination, as well as the stunner gut-punch of an ending that 'The Lobster' delivered that left a big impact on me, as I felt a bit disappointed and underwhelmed by not just the ending, but also the overall execution of some of the film, the final act in particular, which felt a bit rushed and uninspired to me. Overall, this was still a well-made absurdist film for the most part from Lanthimos, the director who knows how to do absurdism best, and Farrell, Nicole Kidman, and Barry Keoghan in the sinister role of Martin all turn in worthy performances."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Yorgos Lanthimos is not a director who plays with detours, or that plays safe, his films are not typical or usual and I can say that only having seen three films of his filmography but it's always nice when a filmmaker dares to abandon more conventional branches and with The Killing of a Sacred Deer he reaffirms it.This is a cold movie and undoubtedly will not be liked by many, either by the plot, the rhythm or how inhuman his characters seems to be. There is not a trace of warmth in all the scenes or the characters but this is essential to endure the film and eventually understand the final part.The Killing of a Sacred Deer is not a film that I can talk to you about it, it's more a film that you must experience and enjoy and it's truly worth it."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "I can't decide what is worse in this movie: plot or dialogues.

Kubrick balances cinematic minimalism with engaging characters and above all visual genius.This film is simply hollow, empty, devoid of any realistic human reactions and the most unlikable characters imaginable.The stoic,robot-like behavior of every single character was probably intended to create a sense of being in a surrealistic space and time but ultimately doesn't pay off and winds up giving one the impression that the director discovered dads box of tools, not knowing how to use them, creates a six ton rocking chair made out of 2X4's. The most bizarre device that was used was to have one of the characters blurt out the whole plot early on in the film. I imagine that was to create a sense of fate and doom but left me thinking,\"well they obviously aren't going to follow that narrative because that would be basically like someone spoiling the plot details. (the people that we hate watching movies with)Unfortunately, that's exactly how it plays out, point to point. There was no deviation whatsoever. I'm not surprised that I read that this movie opened at a film festival because that creates a pretense that if you think the film to be incredibly stupid then, you are simply,\"not getting it\". As a result,those who are overly concerned about what others think, are cowed into pretending that you liked it so that you don't appear unsophisticated.

Eventually he does in a procedure involving putting a sock hat over his face and bags over his family\u2019s faces and he rotates himself with a rifle.

I sincerely regret having watched this movie."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Do you play God or Devil?  Beyond the story about lost, vengeance and repulsion that he sets up, what makes Lanthimos so unique and aggressive is his power to relate poetically atrocious fables, a type of narration that is far, far from the prototype used by cinema currently. He already did so with his previous film and now backs it up with \"The Killing of a Sacred Deer\", dangerous ideas and perspectives without anesthesia embellished with peculiar breakdowns on lies, justice, forgiveness and hard feelings; rubbing salt in the wound of many conservative moviegoers who describe this type of cinematographic approach as ostentatious, ambitious and shamefully voyeuristic. The story veers completely over a psychological, captivating and supernatural air and many movie lovers appreciate that, we really do. Suggesting subtly that everything shown on screen isn't explicitly all they want to say is a tool for  the audience, who must start, on its own, a quick but much deeper study of the connections between the pictures, questioning each line getting out of the mouth of any character, every decision, every distraction, a game in which the spectator must be more clever. Along with \"mother!\" by Darren Aronofsky, \"The Killing of a Sacred Deer\" has one of the craziest, most symbolic and visceral scripts, in the bad and good sense of all the words, of the last decade, guaranteed stupefaction. The screenplay, written by the director alongside his habitual co-writer Efthymis Filippou, is overwhelming; from the opening scene, there are signs warning of an abrasive, variegated in-crescendo trip that gradually, as if it was an uncontrollable beast, increases in strength and belligerence to devour what could have been a tasteless drama. This kind of thing makes more interesting the stories in which no one knows what the hell just happened, that fictional game in which the writers immerse us whether we like or not. Don't forget the superb, staggered build of tension and discomfort, because in fact, the story is not made up of efficient twists and clever moves placed in the right moments, but the story itself is a big, insane twist. Certain elements are required for something like this goes well, fortunately, they're used on this occasion: top-notch performances, an antiseptic cinematography, a lancinating soundtrack and an infinity of technical, artistic and narrative support that become this work, only for a few ones, in one of the best of the year.Here is one of the few films in which the majority, if not all, of the performances are magnificent and strangely credible.  Farrell does an outstanding job in this movie, his movie, we feel true anger, his bewilderment and dread are real through his steely gaze, and unlike many other similar-storyline characters, he's a defenseless father contemplating how his family crumbles, one by one, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Of course, the next big revelation is one of the most terrifying and ominously disturbing antagonists of this year: Barry Keoghan. The 25-year-old actor has found a very complex character, full of nuances  represented by means of monologues that he verbalizes in a way as natural as disturbing, the coldness of his boiling hate is what turns his interpretation into a fabulous triumph, there are sincerity and depth in his words, is such the power of his dramatic range that with just a couple of lines and one \"loathsome\" plate of spaghetti petrifies an entire theater, a visceral performance. Thimios Bakatakis' barbaric visual section must live up to the brutality and strangeness of the enigmatic writing, frankly, it goes significantly beyond. The cinematographer spreads the messages out through a thin and aggressive line of symbolic pictures, from the most deeply dramatic to those blatantly violent; the camera slithers harshly along hospitals, onerous houses, coffee shops and disturbing basements, using long shots to feed the unstoppable tension through tilt and travelling moves that accompany the characters all the time, even making the viewer to hide behind a shield in every moment, it's restless and frightened of what may come as soon as a change of scene happens. Upsetting, exultantly cruel and incredibly hard to watch and forget, Yorgos Lanthimos's \"The Killing of a Sacred Deer\" is his film less chimeric in terms of visual setting, however, the stark and eccentric display of his ideas and the deep-rooted metaphorical meaning of them are pillars in this rabid tale of karma, morality, vengeance, and humility, smothering the spectator' tolerance limits, causing dissimilar results in each experience, in my case, a da*n obsession to know more about this unclassifiable Greek filmmaker. Quickly, the filmmaker shapes his filmography on metaphorical bases, with esoteric and complex ideas that define a caustically indelible work.

Of course this is a film by Yorgos Lanthimos and so the fact it has a menacing undertone, while being set in, initially, a seemingly normal setting didn't surprise me. There's also a strong sense of claustrophobia present, with a fish eye lens type of camera angle and other, shall I say quirky, camera angles used to give the viewer a sense of the impending implosion building up. Colin Farrell plays a very suspicious and somewhat angry sounding, yet quiet in tone, man, the doctor/surgeon, Steven. His irish accent is more apparent in this film than in others I remember seeing him in recently. Also present is Nicole Kidman, who plays the surgeons wife, Anna (Ann Murphy). Its certainly a film that keeps you guessing, which is no bad thing. I also noticed there were some scenes, in between scenes, such as ones showing a character driving elsewhere, in which all music and noise was apparently muted, which adds to the creepy undertone.Its definitely a sinister and haunting film that will leave you second guessing things. It features a scene of self harm, with blood depicted, which may be a trigger for some people, so I thought I ought to flag that. Hence its not a film that will suit or appeal to all but its quite good at what it does - providing an almost Hitchcockian slow tension. I would recommend it on that basis."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "A solid pychological thriller. Has all the necesscary creepy and tingly undertones AND overtones.

The dialog is so strange and unlike anyone ever talks in real life.   All the actors speak with this stilted, dronelike cadence, like there's no emotion coming through (although I'm certain they were directed).
