      "text": "Yes, the animation looks incredibly real, impressively so. I applaud the time and energy that went into creating this. The problem is that it actually works against the film in two very bad ways. The first is simple: The film is unpleasant to look at. This is uncanny valley territory. Everything looks so real, but at the same time clearly false, that it gets very, very creepy. I think this is the main factor in driving kids away. If I were five years old, this would have freaked me out. The other reason is a point I've been trying to get at for a while. Making animated films look realistic is inherently a bad idea. Leaving the uncanny factor out, this is always a bad idea. Why is it that animated films are made? So we can do things that can't be done in real life. Look to the film with the best 3D animation I've ever seen: Tangled. Tangled's animation was detailed down to the shiniest fiber of hair. Even then, it never looked like anyone was really there. If no one will believe it, then do whatever you can with it. Mars Needs Moms, you fail."

I would say it is up their with Avatar.  I could not take my eyes off the screen!!! The story was well thought out and made me compelled to see more. My daughter loved the aliens, and the character Key was very deep for a children s movie. Before reading the bad reviews and not giving this a watch, just give it a try! You will not be dissapointed!!!"

I will say that the film was a little slow and uneventful at the beginning, but once the story unfolded a bit, I thought it was a lot of fun. I'm not quite sure who the target audience was for this and that probably explains the poor box office performance. I don't think young kids would have liked this film, and I don't think older kids would want to see it either; that's the only real negative thing about the film. But if you're a fan of motion capture animation I say check this out!"

      "text": "No broccoli, no TV. That's the edict handed down from a mother to her son, so the motion capture boy tries to fool his motion capture mom by feeding the offending vegetable to the motion capture cat. The ruse works, until the cat barfs, and Milo(Seth Green) is sent to bed without his zombie fix. Feeling burned, Milo wishes that he never had a mom, making the woman who sounds suspiciously like Joan Cusack cry, and before he can take it back, she becomes the victim of an alien abduction, in a style that strongly recalls \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\". In the 1977 Steven Spielberg film, the moviegoer feels the anguish of being left behind as Melinda Dillon watches the otherworldly aircraft whisk her baby away beyond the lit-up sky to heaven knows where. \"Mars Needs Moms\" is not quite so harsh(if it was, you'd have a theater full of traumatized little kids), since Milo sneaks on board the departing spaceship. True, Milo's mother may be lobotomized by a faintly Asian-sounding alien who looks a little like E.T.(MIndy Sterling), but \"Mars Needs Moms\" makes sure that the boy has some fun on this dystopian planet, where girls are more prized than boys. With mother and son always being relatively close together, there's not much in the way of drama, as it would've had Milo needed to find his own passage to the red planet. The boy never realizes the full extent of regret for uttering those hurtful words against his mom because he's too cognizant of her whereabouts. The mission, as a result, doesn't have a whole lot of urgency to it, and yet, we do see what could happen to the captured woman(through another character's mother) which is considerably more frightening than anything in \"Bambi\"."

This is aimed at slightly older kids, i think a PG is only been handed out because its a disney movie. Anyone under 7 will struggle to understand this movie simply because of the action scenes and story is not really \"Disney\". But that being said, my two kids who are 7 and 8 both really enjoyed the movie. Its a warm touching movie with a good meaning to it. Its funny throughout for kids and familys. But those going into this thinking there gonna see a film along the lines of Wall-e or Area 51 they will be disapointed. This is a far cry from cute disney as all the animation looks exactly like real people, which may come across scary for younger viewers i dont recommend any parent taking any child under 6 to see this film some scenes are not suitable, a few parents took there kids out of the film because they were scared. But the animation is amazing, the effects and voice acting are outstanding. If you enjoy a clever movie with twists and turns then this is for you. Im buying the DVD when it comes out. One of the best animated movies of the year."

Also the 3D digital art work was fantastic.  It seemd as if you were there with Milo.  I am going to go see it again and also buy the new DVD.  Thanks Disney and IMD!"

The story is bland beyond belief(not to mention showing signs of sexism), there's no sign of emotion, humor, or relatability, it's cliched like never before, and don't even get me started on how it's obvious only made for mothers to get more attention from their kids. Wouldn't have hurt to make the movie decent...I fell asleep while watching this movie, MIDDAY! If you're looking for something heartwarming, great for families, or even remotely entertaining, don't go with this movie. This really does make me ashamed of Disney."

      "text": "What was originally the demise of ImageMovers, who is currently the only animation studio that makes their films with motion capture, Mars Needs Moms is far from their best work. Sure, the animation is fine, but the story it attempts to tell is bland, predictable and extremely rushed, the character designs, with the exception of Gribble, are very hard to look at, and then there's the characters themselves, who can be one of two things: annoying or a jerk. Gribble can be a mix of both, but just comes off as an idiot, Ki is okay but kind of dated by being a \"hippie\", Two-Cat and Wingnut supply the worst jokes in the movie, and then there's Milo, the main character. I hate the little twerp with a passion. Yes, his actor does a decent job, but he's really annoying, his character design is awful, and at the start of the movie, he says this one line that's so unforgiving that you'll want to hate him for the rest of the movie. It's hard to imagine at first, but once you hear it, you'll understand why. But there are some things that the film did right, like the background animation is nice, some of Gribble's jokes caught me off guard and the music is very well orchestrated. But those alone aren't enough to make it passable."
