      "text": "Inert and exaggerated. Every Breath You Take apparently has the idea that despite looking totally like a conventional thriller, it isn't, but let's just say the play doesn't go well, and ends up in an unpleasant position.Predictability is certainly its largest weakness, but if you add that the three main characters can't fit together in the absence of a noticeably better plot development, Every Breath You Take starts to break down pretty soon, and it's frustrating and flawed until the bitter end."

      "text": "(Mauro Lanari)By now they are defined \"movies in Casey Affleck style\", yet this time he has even surpassed itself for the worse: \"All psychiatrists are charlatans and frauds\". It's certainly true for how his character acts, and in general for how his professional category believes it can/knows how to manage death."
