If you haven't watched it I highly recommend that you do."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Sandler usually makes stupid movies but every now and then hits the bulls-eye with a hilarious movie, unfortunately this is not the case, it's very bad story. Sandler being a Casanova thing!! really? and honestly the best thing that Drew Barrymore has ever done it's to appear in E.T. Far more better things to watch!"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "So this is the second bad movie set in Hawaii to be released in the last couple of weeks. (see \"Big Bounce\") I love Hawaii, but why do all the crappy screenplays have to be set there? Because the writing itself is so godawful, I suppose it needs a little support from the setting. The movie means well, the plot is clever, and and the acting is by and large pretty good (Sean Astin is hilarious - but is this what a hobbit does when he loses the weird-looking feet?), but so many scenes end with an awkward swing-and-miss THUD that you wonder if the writer wasn't beamed back by the Mars lander. Absolutely no sense of comic timing. And although Rob Schneider was great, I have a feeling that Hawaiians aren't going to be too happy with his character. (And people thought that \"Lost and Translation\" was racist!) This sucker pulls out every bad pacific islander stereotype in the book. I felt a little embarrassed for him. The bottom line is that if you like \"Wedding Singer\", you'll still like the chemistry between Sandler and Barrymore. You'll just wish it came in a better movie."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "This movie is the bomb. i love this movie. it is so awesome how he continually tries to win her heart everyday. if a guy did that for me i would definetly give him a shot. i think this movie definetly should be watched by everyone. if you dont like this movie then you have no taste in movies what so ever. peace homedogs"}, {"rating": "10", "text": "By Far Sandler's Best!!!!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "I love this movie. It is not my favorite but I like it. My favorite movie is Abduction! Having read some of the bad reviews you can just tell that they are just thinking about themselves way to much. If you go to the Abduction page I wrote about how people alway think about them selves and not how it might affend others. I hate that about others. Be possitive you know. Well anyway I do love this movie. It is not a ten but it is a eight. Haha. Lol. Ok. Well I better go."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "Not Adam Sandlers worst movie ever but still below average and easily forgettable. For once Rob Schneider made me laugh (the impossible has been done)!

The movie engages the viewer and holds on until the end. It keeps the jokes coming consistently throughout and unlike other Sandler movies the plot doesn't suffer from excessive cheesiness. By the way, it's better than Groundhog Day."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "One of my favorite movies.

Only a limited and narrow mind would dismiss this movie because of its occasionally crude humor.

One of Sandler's better efforts, right up there with Happy Gilmore and The Wedding Singer."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Surprisingly it manages to be a cute and funny romantic comedy.I would recommend this movie. Not Adam Sandlers best but still funny. If you're looking for Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore then this is ot even close to them.

Adam and Drew have a really good chemistry going and the movie had me laughing on several occassions. Definitely worth a watch."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I was particularly put off by the beginning - the jokes were more or less unfunny - so I was almost put off from watching the whole film. The jokes began to get funnier and I felt kind of at ease because it was less about slapstick and more about what was going on. Adam Sandler has that unique humour where you either like it or hate it. I think the film was slightly messy in its construction, certain pieces were skipped to and the conclusion was a bit rushed. It lacked depth because of its limited explanation - although it helped to replay events that had previously happened. That doesn't make it a bad film though, because sometimes romantic comedies are just meant to be enjoyed, and this example of a medical condition in a beautiful romantic environment is refreshingly original."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Eh it was ok at first but it gets rather corny, sappy, and generic.

A very poor execution by Mr. Sandler."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "See Sandler?  When you show us your warm side, we can laugh at you.  You don't always have to fill the screen with gross-out humor.

But, it has a nice plot, and some parts are funny    ."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "50 first dates is a good romantic comedy with some very sweet moments between Barrymore and sandler due to their outrageously good chemistry the film is also pretty funny at times my only issue is that despite having an original concept in delves into formula and rob Schneider's character was a dickhead and not funny."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I will admit right now, I am not an Adam Sandler fan. However, I found this film to be surprisingly enjoyable. It is sweet and cute in places, and while certainly not a masterpiece it is above decent. A vast majority of the jokes work here, and that was great to see, and the direction was surprisingly subtle. The camera work was good making good use of the gorgeous scenery, and the soundtrack was lovely. I had little problem with the performances; Adam Sandler gives of his more likable performances, and Drew Barrymore is the persona of sweetness as his love interest. Out of the supporting performances, Rob Schneider guarantees a number of laughs, and Sean Astin comes close to stealing the film in places. But it is the chemistry of Sandler and Barrymore that shines through despite the flaws that mar it from being more than enjoyable.While Dan Aykroyd has a small appearance, it is sadly one that isn't particularly memorable. The plot isn't exactly original, and certainly isn't the most interesting one ever. And the script does have its ups and downs, and is predictable. Overall though, it is a sweet feel good film. It has its flaws, but it is a brave attempt at a romantic comedy, and mainly because of the chemistry of the two leads it mostly succeeds. 7/10 Bethany Cox"}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Normally Adam Sandler always make bad movies.... there are a few exceptions. This one is hardly one of them.

It has such a great story idea, one which is so interesting and unique and it was pulled off really well. There were a lot of hidden morals that the viewer thinks about. Every character was interesting to watch and learn about, I just wish Nick and Sue got more screen time. Even the animals were lovable. Sometimes Sandler was a bit awkward to watch, not sure if this was the intention with his character, if it was he did a good job.The technicalities were pretty good as well. I thought this may have been one of the weaker areas at first glance. However with shooting most of the film in Hawaii you can't really go wrong. The music choice as well was excellent, it's great when the music matches the theme and location. There were some scenes that I wished were much longer though, they went by too fast to build up emotion sometimes. It just seemed to cut too soon in an emotional scene, and then before you know it we're somewhere else."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Very funny! It would suck to go through life that way though.

It is an enjoyable enough romantic comedy with a cool twist.  Some of the jokes are much better than others, there's still some of that \"Adam Sandler awkwardness\" in some of the jokes which for my taste doesn't need to be in the movie and only took away from my enjoyment.
