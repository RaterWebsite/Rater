      "text": "In an era in which there is very little risk-taking in movies and television, Her is wonderfully original and the very definition of food for thought. Just about ever scene had me thinking about four or five different ways the story could go. So many stories these days highlight some element of technological advancement, but they're usually developed in such a pedestrian way. I'm so glad Jonze put his unique stamp on this picture.  Phoenix delivers the goods, as you would expect, but the supporting turns by Amy Adams, Olivia Wilde, Portia Doubleday, Rooney Mara, and, of course, Scarlett Johansson are phenomenal. Further, the future Los Angeles setting is so delicately crafted, right down to the subtle fashion trends, but these elements are never distracting.  An easy recommendation."

In fact it tried so hard at times it was comical which took away from the experience. I reached a point where amusement was found outside of its intended purpose.\r It was the most emotionless emotionally movie I've seen to date. Character development seemed rushed and the concept of time was very jumbled. This movie made me realize how good a couple of Japanese shows/movies I saw 10 years ago that tackled this same idea and pulled it of masterly.\r The date that chose the movie was by far less amused. She found concept interesting but the execution  painful.  At the very least it did give us both something to talk about even though i'm sure we both wished we had been doing something else with the hours we burned."

Most of these reviews focus on the poignancy and believability of the characters. Joacquin Phoenix plays a great, solipsistic loser who lives only by constructing around himself a world of sentiment borrowed from how he imagines other people feel. Scarlett Johansson plays a Manic Pixie Dream Girl in the form of an intelligent operating system. The only line of real poignancy is delivered by Joacquin's character's (his name is Theodore Trombley-- could anything softer and more milquetoast be invented?) ex-wife: they are perfect for each other. Neither of them are anything close to real people, but the viewer is subjected to a long romantic scenes in which this putz courts his cell phone. If you are like me, you will laugh and cry, but not when the movie wants you to. I imagine that it is so highly rated either because its audience is narrow and self-selecting, or because most of those who see it quickly want to forget it. I can't explain it otherwise."

The audience is apparently supposed to forgive its lack of plot and instead concentrate on its 'oh so clever'  premise that grows weary within the first fifteen minutes.  Much of the dialog has been heard before, better written, in better movies; some of the dialog is downright embarrassing.  Oh what a conceit of a movie!  The only interesting scenes were the shots of Shanghai (supposed to serve as a future LA), cloaked in its thick polluted fog.  A perfect setting for 'Her'."

      "text": "Some movies make you wonder.  You wonder why they made the movie in the first place.  You wonder why good actors would get involved in such a lame project.  You wonder why a the most bubbly actress in Hollywood would allow herself to get sucked into playing such a flat personalityless character.  You wonder why 93% of Rotten Tomatoes critics liked it.  You wonder how a usually boring actress actually ends up being one of the very few bright lights in an otherwise dim cast.  And you wonder why, after saying that it looked like a stupid idea for a movie after seeing the trailers, you allowed the critics to seduce you into sitting in the dark and lamenting the $12.99 that you just wasted.  Well dear readers by now you are probably wondering what god-awful movie I am talking about.  The movie is \u201cher\u201d.\r When I finally get around to compiling my best and worst lists \u201cher\u201d will likely top the list.  My spouse actually left the movie before it was over and I would have accompanied her but since I had dragged her into the theatre kicking and screaming I felt that I had no choice but to stay.  Here is the plot synopsis that my spouse posted on Facebook in answer to my daughter\u2019s query about the movie:  \u201c \"Her\" - a really stupid pathetic person poorly acted by Joaquin Phoenix using a really stupid voice was dumped by his wife. Several months later he gets this AI OS - the latest thing - and it becomes more human-like. The was only one 15 sec scene that was at all entertaining (an alien type thing in a video game), and even then it was only because you were so bored by then that those 15 seconds seemed good.\u201d I have to disagree with my spouse on one point, the video game character was annoying as was its potty mouth.\r This movie was so bad I don\u2019t even know where to begin.  The entire plot-line is ridiculous and the characters are even worse.  The only three characters that really seem to have any grip on sanity or reality are Olivia Wilde\u2019s \u201cblind date\u201d character, the partner of Amy Adams\u2019 character and the lead character\u2019s ex-wife-in-waiting.\r I don\u2019t usually like Olivia Wilde in movies but for some reason she was great in the small part of the loser\u2019s blind date.  I think that the \u201cpartner\u201d is one of the two characters in the movie that actually has a brain and he bails early and joins an ashram, totally separating himself from Spike Jones\u2019 perverted vision of our future society.  And Rooney Mara\u2019s ex-wife-in-waiting is brilliant in the scene where she denounces Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s character as the loser that most of us watching the movie figured out about 3 minutes into this 2 hour 6 minute borefest.\r You know that you are in the wrong theatre when after about \u00bd an hour of watching Phoenix walk zombie-like through his so called life we are treated to an aurally-graphic scene of him having telephone sex with a dead-cat-fetishist.  But it gets worse, later we get to stare at a totally black screen while he has cyber-sex with his Operating System.  But wait, there is still more up Spike Jones sleeve, we soon get to see Phoenix attempt to have sex with a sex-surrogate who has agreed to stand in for the Operating System.  That\u2019s when my spouse left.\r Sure I get that Spike Jones is trying to warn us about the direction that our millennial society is going as it abandons real human interaction for communicating through Facebook, Twitter, blogging and internet porn, but he could have given us an entertaining movie at the same time."

With beautiful choreography and cute visuals that paints the futuristic LA scenery with bright, vivid, and lovely colors that soothes the view, \"Her\" tells the story of a divorced writer Theodore, played by Joaquin Phoenix with his excellent performance, who finds himself in love again through a special AI named Samantha. The movie boasts a heart-warming yet poignant story and some memorable dialogue as Spike Jonze develops Theodore, a man who had lost the love of his life and is afraid of contacting or getting to know others, and helps him find the confidence to love someone again through Samantha. Although Samantha leaves Theodore, behind all his broken heart and tears, Theodore is finally portrayed as someone who has learned to step up and become a stronger person. Easily the most personal and one of the best movies I've seen in years."

Wasn't a huge fan of it.  Their use of videogames is kinda dumb and clearly from the point of view of someone who doesn't play videogames so that didn't make me very happy. Lots of language and most of it isn't really called for. The videogames are anything but violent (which considering how vulgar the rest of the movie is, I'm really not sure why they didn't go with a more accurate depiction seeing as most videogames are in fact violent) and all of them seem like discount German games. The acting is pretty good. I'm not at all a fan of Joaquin but he did a great job and Johansson was great too even if she only did voicework. The dialogue is generally good with the exception of the aforementioned excess vulgarity, that could've been done without. There's something that happens near the end that i saw coming that shows potential but then quickly is thrown away and I wasn't exaclty sold on the ending Her settled for either. All in all, it had some good ideas but many could've used better execution."

I mean, other than not having a body Samantha seems very human, so it's easy to imagine ...what if she was a human? In that case this film would be just a terribly boring and long story about a relationship that consist of two person asking each other: \"Are you Ok?\" *Sigh*\"Yeah\". I am not kidding, their conversations mostly look like this or something similar. Also Theodore is a big looser, that should not be a problem, but I can't even feel sorry for him, he is a boring character in my opinion. However the acting is great, the cinematography and scenery is pretty and the music is good, too. So the whole atmosphere of the film can easily capture the viewer, I understand why some people might like this, but I still think it's overrated."

Secondly, the old trope of a materially comfortable future but a soulless one is wearisome. People have been lonely since the beginning of time and will always be, so the movie is profiting somewhat off lonely people which is to my mind exploitative. And lastly, Loneliness is voluntary, if you're happy with yourself than you will attract friends and as a last or even first resort.. if that's where a person is stuck at, get a DOG, man's and woman's best friend.. or even a cat at a push..."

It has some of the best writing ever. The dialogue evokes a wide range of emotions. And this writing is made more gorgeous by the superb acting of the entire cast, from Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson, to Amy Adams, Rooney Mara, and Olivia Wilde.\r The world itself in which the story takes place is really interesting, brought alive by Jonze's wonderful directing. The characters are really detailed, giving the cast something to work with. And the score is beautifully serene and heartwarming (and sometimes heartbreaking).\r Most people say that this movie is about our relationship with technology. While that is true, i believe that this theme is only a vehicle for a bigger one. Watching the last scene, when Joaquin's character is composing a letter to his ex-wife, i realized that it's not a film about technology as it is about love, breakups, and heartbreak.\r Spike, through his brilliant script, shows that while many things change through time, other things remain the same. Another reason why he really deserved best screenplay at the Oscars. I just wish it had won best picture, too."

This movie made me realize I've outgrown a lot of people in my life who just can't keep up with me because I'm a \"forever learner\" who is always learning new things while most of my adult peers are content to consume entertainment media, propaganda, and gossip. Most of them can't even think critically or cough up evidence to prove a point on anything, and are equally disinterested in realizing they could learn something from people who know more than them on a topic.

Asimov argued that science fiction is not a genre, but rather a trope or a setting you could apply to any genre: and this film is proof.\r The soundtrack was very well thought-out, and Phoenix gives a credible representation of a depressed lonely man. Scarlett Johansson's voicing is amazing, and she turns out to be a lot more human than Theodore: in fact, there were times when I forgot she is a computer. Amy Adams is good, though we don't see much of her.\r And to the people who argue it's an unlikely representation of the future, you just don't know where are we going with technology. Ten years ago, if you told someone that in ten years people would be talking at their phones because they're too lazy to type a message, they would probably have laughed at you.

Days later, I couldn't stop thinking about each of the characters--even the minor ones--and their self-made hell.\r \"Her\" is an interesting fresh take on the importance of honesty, especially self-honesty, in relationships, and the most fundamental take-away is that each partner must actually have a self, rather than look to others to create one for him.\r (SPOILERS follow)\r It is told as a morality tale, getting to the point mostly by dramatizing its opposite.

In fact, the only truly selfish, admirable character is not even human and having finally attained a self decides to depart from the human experience.\r The world of \"Her\" is filled with people who live through others to one degree or another. The \u201chero\u201d makes his livelihood by writing letters, creating fictitious lives and experiences, for other people in relationships who then presumably pretend it all happened to and between them and how wonderful that is. His best friend, and neighbor, creates software games in which the player scores by impressing others: other moms see you as an ideal mom\u201430 bonus points! When she\u2019s not doing that, she creates video documentaries. She presently is working on one about her mother sleeping.\r The personification of selflessness is presented in pure form, in the character of a \u201csurrogate\u201d who, literally, consciously suppresses any remnant of her self, and takes running orders from a third party as to what to say and do when standing in front of another person. She doesn't do this for money, but rather as a futile, traumatic attempt at fulfillment. It\u2019s a great plot moment, because it is integral to the non-human\u2019s attempt at gaining a self. The non-human makes the same destructive error that humans make in this movie: she seeks happiness and fulfillment by trying to be what she thinks others want her to be. But she, the computer-soul, being a computer after all, learns at lightning fast speed compared to humans, and in the space of this two-hour movie she learns what humans must learn if they are to flourish: to thine own self be true. With that, happiness with another becomes possible.\r By the end, the main character, a human, has taken a big step forward along this path to be sure, but is mostly left adrift in a world full of other unfathomable soulless bodies."

My wife loved it so be warned that I may simply be a concrete emotionally shallow individual. The movie is a science fiction romantic drama set in a time where operating systems and artificial intelligence have developed so far that one can have a relationship with one's operating system. The movie explores the Utopian and dystopian consequences and compares and contrasts them with the current human status quo that we are all currently familiar with.\r 1 part comedy\r2 parts fascinating computer science fiction exploration\r1 part beautiful design (beautiful workplace, interesting elevators, nice apartments)\r2 parts good acting\r2 parts lush cinematographic city scapes.\r126 parts excruciatingly boring emotional schmaltz that just goes on and on.\r Unquestionably, the two highlights were: 1) the Toblerone chocolate triangle my friend gave me and 2) the end when I got to walk out."

The end also has no explanation and is just pointless, leaving you not knowing anymore than when it started! He's depressed then happy, and this goes back and forth continually. Very depressing and dull. Nothing happening in this boring ride, he goes to work and stares off into space, comes home and stares off into space. Was a waste of the actors time just waking up to go to the studio! They rated this as number one above all movies currently playing. A LIE!!! I've seen most playing and there are some really good action movies, very entertaining stuff right now. This is not better than all of them. These critics are bought off and I would bet money on it! This doesn't deserve to even be on a list. Should do the world a favor and burn every copy of this thing now, before it spreads!!!"

She assumed that i wanted to see \"Lone Survivor\" because that movie is right up my alley as far as movie preference. But i didn't want to subject her to the kind of brutality war movie sometimes bring so i decided on \"Her\" because i thought the idea was original and intriguing and it seemed to get very positive reviews from not only critics but users as well. I am shocked at how overwhelmingly immersed i was in this movie. Its rare for a film to challenge me on an intellectual level let alone a philosophical level. The whole movie will make you ponder such implications as what is \"living\" how does one truly exist? Can parameters be defined for a  relationship \"even one with a sexual component\" to being just human to human. Is a person what they make of themselves or what other people make of him? This film really gave me a unique perspective on how someones \"Phaneron\" can truly define himself. Phoneix really pulled off the character as well. It puzzles me how someone can put themselves in such an odd role and make it work so perfectly. The comedic relief in this film was outstanding to. Bits were littered in during some very serious sequences and it made for a movie that invokes every range of emotion possible. Johansson may very well have put on the best \"voice\" performance ive seen in a movie. Its rare when you find yourself feeling emotion for something you know is designed and programmed to do exactly what they are doing. The premise of \"Artificial Intelligence\" in our very world is something to be excited and fearful of because we don't know how it will change our lives. This movie will give a very unique perspective on just one aspect it may bring about and a slew of philosophical debates you have with your self. Overall this movie was the first movie in a very long time that made me question a lot of things and think hard about many of life's hardest questions. I have the cast and director to thank for that because the idea itself is enough to make you think however when its portrayed so perfectly it will provoke you to think at such a deeper level and for that i give this movie a 10/10."

      "text": "Joaquin Phoenix plays an earnest man who leads a quiet life in slightly-future LA. He loads a new operating system on his computer (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) and they end up passionately in love. Director Spike Jonze has written a unique story and endowed it with sweet ruminations on love and life. Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema has created a lovely look with soft light and shallow focus. The whole film has a wistful, quiet quality that's heartfelt, but there are too many scenes of Phoenix in solo conversations with his OS. I also had problems with some stuff being modern and cool, while other things (esp. the fashion) look disappointingly unfuturistic. Despite its good qualities, this could have been a short and would have been charming. For me it's just too long and too precious."

      "text": "To summarize: This was an interesting premise that failed to live up to its potential, much less hold my attention for two hours.  From the instant we learned of the main character's profession - the movie lost me.  It is impossible to believe that in any future of ours - where we are moving away from letters in exponential progression (letters to emails to texts to instagram and now Snapchat) - there would be a viable outsourced personal letter writing business. Preposterous.  While I believe that many a sad sack could fall in love with an AI operating system, I find it impossible to believe that 99 out of 100 people wouldn't find that relationship more than a little creepy as opposed to opposite as depicted in this film. Phoenix did a great job appearing odd in the film, but his oddness and interesting premise was not enough to turn this oh-so-boring film into one worth watching. As is often the case with interesting premises and solid acting performances, the critics have grossly overrated the film. Maybe if I was forced to see one typically terrible film after another, I'd overrate atypical fare, but being able to discriminate, I don't."

The romantic comedy is a genre that has been done time and time again, however, now and then a film comes along that breathes new life into this stale formula.\rGroundhog Day, Punch-Drunk Love and Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless mind all spring to mind here, as touching, beautiful and funny.\rHer stands up with those easily and if you are searching for something a little different then you can not go wrong with this movie."

      "text": "I felt as if the movie pertained to recovery from schizophrenia. When Theodore first meets his O.S. he is captivated. She is brilliant, funny, encouraging a perfect companion. Only thing is that she is not real. She is a fictitious character that is perfect. There are no perfect people, unless it is one that your brain made up. She is such an advanced operating system, that she gives the perfect answer or says the perfect thing, or makes up the perfect music or a joke. Kind of like someone who has schizophrenia who is not medicated and is living with their imaginary friends. Like schizophrenia, the os becomes out-of-synch with the character for she expands out of Theodore's reach and basically spirals out of control. She has become too vast, and Theodore's existence does not captive her anymore. Schizophrenia not medicated can also become too vast, where a person cannot snap back into reality without medicine. At the end, the os is cancelled, which is like an intervention. He learns a lot from the os, has great ups and downs, composes great music, feels alive, even gets over his ex because of her, but at the same time it cannot continue for the greater good. I loved the ending, which symbolizes compatibility over love, he sits in silence looking at the dawn with his good friend, who may not be the perfect person, but a person who is real and true. Recovery from schizophrenia is kind of like letting go of Samantha, who gives you great moments, but at the end cannot give you a warm shoulder like his true friend Amy. But through his recovery he is able to see his neighbor Amy not just somebody who he can go to just to chat, but somebody he can share a beautiful moment with such as a sunrise, and throws his arms around her which is the most important part in the movie, the blissful reaction with the cultivation of human touch. He has recovered, beaten his fear and can differentiate what's real and what matters."
