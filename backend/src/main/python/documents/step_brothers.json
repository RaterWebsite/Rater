Also, surprisingly mean-spiried, nasty, and \"woman-hating\" (and I'm a man saying this, not a reactionary hyper-feminist). Vulgar without being funny, which is the worst sin a comedy can commit. I've really enjoyed both lead actors' work in the past, so the awfulness of this was a real shock. 98 minutes of your life that you will never get back, and will regret having spent with this atrocity. I would award negative stars if that were possible."

I feel the reason that I have watched it so much really lies with how the characters and actors portray themselves. It is such a stupid movie that I can quote it around people and they will almost instantly know what I am talking about and that's why I love it. I can bring it up around people and we can laugh about it without even watching the movie. A lot of people haven't even seen the movie but they still know the quotes and that's why it is one of my all time favorite movies. Yes it is stupid and honestly not that great production wise, but the quotes make it worth the while."

I know its not a movies for everyone because it does have some pretty stupid humour but I'm a sucker for that stuff. This is one of the many Will Ferrell classics that have been released in the past 15 years. John C. Reilly is great beside him as he is equally as funny. It would be nice to see these two share a lead again (they were great together in Talladega Nights as well. Adam Scott is great as Ferrell's douchebag brother its a role that I wasn't expecting from him after watching him in Parks and Recreation but it suits him. Anyone who loves a good laugh will love Step Brothers."

The characters are extremely over-the-top, the plot is hilarious and the jokes never stop.  From the opening credits to the final scene, this movie delivers the funny.  You can't expect any high-brow humor here.  But the cursing, potty humor,   clever plot twists, obscure references and subtle comedy is by far one of my favorite movies.  It's full of one-liners that you feel compelled to imitate.  As a side note, the DVD has great extra features.  If you get a chance, listen to the commentary.  It's just as funny as the movie itself.  Best: John C. Reilly and Will Ferrell's AWESOME comedic chemistry.Worst: No sequel."

When you are happy to see Seth Rogen in a WILL FARRELL movie, you know the times have changed. There's such a thing as dumb comedy done right (Dumb and Dumber, Old School), and then there's such a thing as dumb comedy that's just plain dumb (i.e. a complete and utter absence of wit or creativity). There was hardly anything to appreciate at all in this movie. You can thank Horatio Sanz (!) for me not giving this film a zero, as his two-minute screen time as the singer in a 80's-only Billy Joel cover band was the only piece of inspired comedy in the entire movie. Piano Man!"

      "text": "What might one expect from the combination of Will Ferell and John C Reilly? They gave us that inane Nascar race flick, so we should know well just what exactly their product would be. I do like their daring and resourcefulness though - in a time of serious, realistic movies, they dare producing something so inane and ludicruously and purposely-funny and yet, they turn in performances that are just right for their parts. The movie's theme might be a bit too unusual, but both Ferell and Reilly are perfect in their depictions. I do wonder - if a 40-year-old man WERE unemployed and staying home with their parents, would they also be as child-like and immature like these two? Or is it just a comedy no-brains flick that Ferell and Reilly would have us believe?? I would like to hope that there is a social message here somewhere, but of course, if they had acted like grownups, that might have totally ruined it! Robert Jenkins and Mary Steenburgen are good together, but at times, I really cringed at how low Jenkins might stoop to - his character is empty and has absolutely no substance. I do feel for Steenburgen, her empathy for her two sons, her moving-on-with-what-my-life-really-is countenance is impressive. But obviously, if the perfect ending hadn't happened, if Jenkins and Steenburgen's characters hadn't got back together again, and the elder brother, Derek, hadn't piped down, it wouldn't have been a comedy flick, would it? Seriously, Ferell's testicle-scene was the last straw - it was totally unnecessary and absolutely disgusting. But then again, what reason and logic do we expect from Ferell anymore? I'd go with his Megamind depiction anyday than this disgust of a movie! This doesn't mean that he's not funny, he is, but at times, he can just be too uncontrollable and too inane. If only Ferell-Reilly could come up with a serious, mature subject and show their true talents, I'd be delighted!"

After an hour and a half of nothing but things that were supposed to be funny, but were not, it was refreshing to see the ending, which actually was kind of funny and oddly touching. It ultimately left a good taste in my mouth as this one ended, which is why I was less harsh than I thought I would be. In addition, Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, did have some good chemistry and were well-matched. Unfortunately, they were let down by a horrible script and tasteless joke after tasteless joke. Damn shame, really."

This film however I did like, I don't know if its Will Ferrell (whom I just find generally funny) or just the premise of the film, I mean this film is stupid, its meant to be but its funny because of that, Yes the second half of the film is where everything goes down hill, with repetitive jokes and simple and not that effective storytelling to wrap everything up. But you can tell Ferrell and Reilly are having a whale of a time, and that's were its at, this film would have worked better as a tv show but the relation between the two stars is what makes this film, two 40 year old men behaving like infants is just funny pure and simple, so take this film with a big pinch of salt and focus on the comedy they bring because to be honest its a breath of fresh air from most of the trash produced from a seemingly tired genre of films.\r Will Ferrell and John C.Reilly are the best with Ferrel having a soft spot for the rest of the cast seemingly stereotypical, but what do you expect, the film focuses on there relation and how it affects others, it does tend to use its repetitive formula and goes downhill after about an hour but the laughs are defiantly there, obviously not one of the best comedy films but a good effort and a different approach with by my books one of the finest comedy actors from America."

      "text": "Ever since Adam McKay and Jude Apatow launched family-friendly comedy movies like \u201cThe 40-Year-Old Virgin\u201d and \u201cAnchroman\u201d, the track record of comedies got back on track, and Step Brothers is one of the examples of their collaboration as director and producer. Will Ferell and John C. Reilly play overgrown but slow-learning men who have to get along and be step brothers after their parents (Steenburgen & Jenkins) got hooked.    Ferell and Reilly's chemistry as childish 40-year-olds are effective while watching on screen. Some gags work frequently and have a substance to the development of their characters and relationship. Moreover, the roles of Steenburgen, Jenkins and Scott also help to add entertainment value and balance the family-themed tone of the story.Yes, Ferell and Reilly share the same vibe, interests, charisma and humor, but that is also the main flaw of Step Brothers. The movie mistakenly becomes a joke as two of the lead actors play the same one note juvenile character.VERDICT: Too juvenile it becomes sort of a sketch comedy, which is a good thing."

      "text": "Finding The Voice TogetherStep BrothersMcKay's daunting task to bring two comic energies on screen that is of such high caliber with an eerie relationship to work on, is an average brawler sparked up by illuminating performances. A gullible world as such of McKay is his core strength, and he makes sure he uses it whenever the script gets damp, lucky for him, there is very little space to do so. The husbandry gags that the film relies upon for the most part of it, ought to have installed by Reilly and Ferrell and is thoroughly steered by them. From banal notions and hilarious illogical one liners, this comic drama, contradictory to popular beliefs, has witty sense of humor.To pull off your typical dinner-conversation-gone-wrong case with intertwined complicated equations bubbled up by irrevocable actions shines a new light every time. The physical sequences are convincing and flat out hilarious spiced up by irregular yellings of their deepest darkest secrets that tickles you. McKay's clean trial of putting up these two hilarious personas on stand makes us see through and through of their nature which works immensely on dramatic bits no matter how little they are.Ferrell as the shy Mama's boy, obliged but never to admit sort of stature is sculpted on screen by him where his flamboyancy on melting down and cheering up welcomes you to join this unfathomable emotions. Reilly, on the other hand, the impossible to live with guy, is where the antics move accordingly, and his reach to grasp Ferrell's schemes has merits of its own. These two twinkling stars are the heart of the film, if the camera seeks someone else, the energy wears off quickly. Step Brothers feels like real brothers for their constant bickering and petty fights, with all the crisp from surface to the core, this family is fun."

      "text": "There is a certain beauty in Adam McKay's 'Step Brothers'. A childish innocence which could have been this film's mark to greatness. Unfortunately this approach is often ignored in favor of screwball comedy which would be fine, but a few set-pieces at attempting humor are more screwball than comedy.To be honest, I expected more from the man who directed cult classics like the 'Anchorman' series and even tackled with Oscar-worthy material in 'The Big Short'. Here, though, the story of two middle-aged men living with their parents is often riddled with awkward pacing and failed attempts at comedy. One such example is when Brennan Huff (Will Ferrell)'s brother, which has a successful career and an apparently happy family arrives into the scene and his wife, mentally damaged by his mannish control is having sexual intercourse with Dale Doback (John C. Reilly). They are nearly caught by the family but through a ridiculous explanation they get away with it. I was prepared to turn a blind eye to this in favor of comedy, but it happened twice.Do not get me wrong. This film has funny moments. Just about enough to grant it a passing note, but then getting close to the ending, everything turns into the typical idealistic pathos. Seriously, is like watching a prolonged yogurt commercial. Also, this decay starts really early being a transitional slope from mediocrity to lackluster happy ending shtick.Screwball comedy is a dangerous concept to work with. It is fragile and has a cheap and immature aesthetic which needs to be balanced carefully. When it works is brilliant, tongue-and-cheek; but when it doesn't, it can get a bit stupid. So yeah, 'Step Brothers' definitely has humor, thanks in part to Reilly and the screwball master himself, Will Ferrell, is just that it breaks too often."
