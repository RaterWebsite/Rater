      "text": "Conspiracy Theory isn't bad when it comes to most of the details, it's when we see the big picture that it becomes sloppy looking and barely pasted together. Roberts and Gibson have less-than-believable chemistry with an even less believable love story. The movie makes it look like Mel Gibson isn't even acting, the actor is just going through everyday life as a crazy, psycho conspiracy theorist."

      "text": "Conspiracy Theory is a 1997 action, thriller type mystery film directed by Richard Donner who brought us classics such as Lethal Weapon and Assassins. .. Conspiracy Theory stars Patrick Stewart, Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts... The film starts off okay then as it drags goes downhill and the only good thing in my opinion about the film is Julia Roberts. Mel Gibson is totally ridiculous and some of the acting isn't great and it's a film I never really took to that much to be honest so it's not a great film and compared to Richard Donner's earlier works like Assassins and Lethal Weapon it's bad and even the first Superman movie Richard Donner made was better than Conspiracy Theory."

      "text": "On paper this should be a great movie. The cast, the cinematography, the plot. But the shame of it is it never finds a consistent tone and the chemistry just isn't there between the leads. Add to the that some terrible soundtrack choices and a screenplay that meanders around its complex characters and situations with little grace. Huge missed opportunity."

      "text": "Overwhelmingly well performed acting, really impressive. I love the setting and how you slowly figure out what\u00b4s going on. I had no problems matching the different groups and their interests like other reviewers criticized. Lovely Soundtrack. Also the chemistry between the protagonists respectively the love story does look very good and delivers perfectly, it\u00b4s really heart touching, a match made in heaven. I don\u00b4t believe in those conspiracy theories in real life, but within the movie it\u00b4s pretty nicely done and fits in. You got action, drama, love story and even some kind of mystery in this movie. Some critics mentioned the predictability of this film, but I didn\u00b4t see many things coming so at least for me it was always pretty thrilling. Excellent movie."

      "text": "Conspiracy Theory is a good detective thriller with detective elements. A prime example of a great thriller from the 90s. A great actor blows. Still young enough Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts. But Patrick Stewart clearly does not age) If at the beginning the film begins to be perceived as a comedy, then over time the viewer begins to pay attention to all the details that Jerry notes. The viewer is slowly immersed in the plot, the viewer can compare herself with Alice, who also at the beginning did not pay attention to everything. The final is somewhat crumpled, and the final is open. After watching the film, you begin to treat paranoids differently."

      "text": "This film is strange, as it seems to go in so many directions that it is going nowhere. Anyway, and despite a weak and little intriguing start, it revealed to be improving and captivating my attention over time.The film is based on Jerry Fletcher, a taxi driver obsessed with government conspiracies, who runs an insignificant subscription periodical, where he shares his ideas, and has an obsessive passion for Alice Sutton, a government official he often visits. One day he is caught and tortured, which indicates that someone took some of his ideas seriously, but Alice realizes that something really may have happened to that man, which leads her to try to help him.The film is ultimately average. It starts slowly, in an uninteresting way and takes its time to develop, but it was necessary to understand what would come next. For me, things only started to get interesting when the main character was caught and tortured. At about two hours and fifteen minutes, it is an excessively long film for the content it presents, and has so many twists and turns that it can leave the audience confused and without interest in what they are watching. Another thing that caught my attention was the similarity with the film \"The Pelican Brief\", not only due to the participation of the same main actress, but also due to the similarity of the story told.The cast is dominated by two central names: Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts. Both collaborate well together, although I was left with the feeling that there was little chemistry for a romantic couple. Gibson looked more like an obsessed maniac than a man in love. In fact, Gibson doesn't seem to know how far his character's sanity goes and his performance ends up reflecting that, with many exaggerations and a lack of psychological depth. Roberts is good enough in a very psychologically underdeveloped character. As this is an obsessive and paranoid thriller, it would have been interesting to see these two characters with more psychological wealth and less appearance, but these are scriptwriter mistakes. Finally, a word to Patrick Stewart, in a discreet performance that seemed effective.It is not a film that stands out due to technical requirements or production values, having a regular cinematography. Some scenarios, like Fletcher's house, were very well designed and the special effects are good."
