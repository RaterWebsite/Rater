I think the strongest element that this movie has going for it is the chemistry between its actors. Once the clunky expository beginning is out of the way, and the party of misfit superpowered youths has assembled, the movie is quite enjoyable. The scenes where the kids hang out and become friends are some of the truest scenes in the movie. From a production standpoint, it feels like a straight to Netflix or straight to TV presentation. The script is full of plotholes as well. However, if you like YA or enjoyably good acting, check this one out."

I do understand why this was done: not sure how the movie will do... don't want to add story lines that won't matter if their won't be another film. With this being said I feel that the story was rushed and time was lost...it seems like the story only took place between a few weeks but the books elongates their journey, bringing them closer: a family. Looking at the movie from a viewpoint of someone that hasn't read the books, the story was exciting and real. I definitely feel that the book was better but I did enjoy the acting and the production as a whole. I never felt bored... always waiting for what was to come."

      "text": "Darkest Minds begins hitting heavy, but unfortunately fails to continue that way. What really seems to me like a remix of the movie \"Divergent\" (which isn't a good thing), The Darkest Minds, focuses on a very forced love story, forcing even more a triangle than actually focusing on children dying over something that gives the survivors powers.Instead it turns into a generic, boring and heavily cliched movie, with corny dialogue that will make you roll your eyes until you have a migraine.There is absolutely NO RESOLUTION to any plot lines, making this feel like a 104 minute long introduction to a sequel. But let's be honest here, will a sequel really happen?"

      "text": "I must say, I like The Darkest Minds. There\u2019s definitely potential for character growths in sequels. There are a few developmental concepts that are shown which I shall discuss further on. Initially, I\u2019m watching the movie thinking to myself: is this a wannabe X-Men/sequel to Logan? Yet, I find The Darkest Minds really comes to approach difficult generational hypotheticals and topics set under conditions that make the film\u2019s intentions effective as well as the overall film more interesting.The first developmental concept I want to discuss is the use of the term \u2018us\u2019 in the film. The film is set in a childless world with a suffering economy. \u2018Us\u2019 becomes a generational word in phrases indicating a separation as well as a unity between differences and alikeness on the basis of generational circumstances. Highlighting Generation Z in relation to Millennials, Generation X, Baby Boomers, and the Silent Generation raises interesting stances concerning developments of the modern world. Connections between each generation really affects the outcome of the story.The second developmental concept branching from the first examines the requirements of society. People will have to work regardless of their generation in order to create sustainable-thriving societies. The film situates \u2018us\u2019 in manners which denote ways for generations, in particular Generation Z, to thrive relying on each individual in their own generation (long-term with the assistance of the capable, honest, and willing from prior generations?) and their natural surroundings due to the misappropriations of societal necessities by larger entities of earlier generations. Life and the skills one has in their life are core to the value systems in the film. What is even wilder is that particulars of earlier generations are using individuals with certain skill sets from newer generations and pitting them against each other for their own purposes.The third developmental concept concerns the use of technologies. The film focuses on the skills each individual is capable of utilizing effectively, their natural-super abilities, and only touches base with other forms of tech to connect with divisive behaviors from earlier generations. Keep in mind, the film is highlighting large entities, figures that may greatly affect scapes of societies, and is not indicting entire generations under an umbrella of same though highlights types of behaviors, circumstances, and mindsets that cause generational mayhem and unease as well as the opposites of all the aforementioned which may cause peace and ease.The fourth developmental concept I want to discuss concerns war. Aren\u2019t we able to transform all of the worlds war materials into extremely large extra-curricular training facilities? People have to stop wanting to use each other for ill and have to stop wanting ill for other people. Amidst so much grand nature and a world of so many extra-curricular activities, I don\u2019t understand the purpose of constantly warring. Misery should not be anyone\u2019s choice equilibrium.The Darkest Minds looks good and flows well. The sound editing is one of its strongest areas and really boosts the cinematography. The acting is really decent though I think the film may really do well with more character development overall. Societies have come a long way. Plagues have been real detrimental factors shaping communities for generations. Germs and disease are an important area of discussion which is not given any more attention than is necessary to propel the story at moments though very important to discuss especially in accordance with developing medical technologies.The story is touching\u200a\u2014\u200anot gripping\u200a\u2014\u200abut, at the end of the film, I find myself slightly upset\u200a\u2014\u200athough understanding\u200a\u2014\u200aupset\u200a\u2014\u200aslightly. I\u2019m not going to spoil the ending for you. The film sets a lot of emphasis on memories and relationships between people as a catalyst for the story which I think is a strong point of the story that may have a lot more impact with more details.I think every film serves a purpose; some films are really good pieces overall, some films are meant to incite one to think of the film\u2019s presentations, some films are distractions, and\u200a\u2014\u200awell\u200a\u2014\u200asome films do more than the descriptions or reputations their genres might seem to entail\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially for a viewer. It\u2019s like how I feel about Teeth: I low-key want to own that film on DVD. The Darkest Minds brings to light interesting topics to converse about due to the settings which the topics exist in. I think the film is worth watching and, if there is one, I will be finding my way to watch a sequel.Overall Rating: B/B+\u2014 K.D.If you\u2019re into Poetry and other bits of creativity, check out my Instagram: @Dufreshest."

I really liked the characters and the banter between them (especially the protagonist, Ruby) and I found the system of powers interesting and logical. The movie does at times feel a bit light for the dystopian world it\u2019s set in, but I feel like it hits on some heavier themes without being grotesque, which is important for the audience it was targeting. It wasn\u2019t a perfect movie, of course, but I don\u2019t think it deserves the strongly negative reviews I\u2019ve notice. At the very least, I feel like its a movie worth seeing so you can form your own opinions."

      "text": "Ok... Let's be honest. It cannot be the best movie but is quite enjoyable. The movie has the potential to develop a great plot for future movies. The movie starts a premise that was previously known (dystopian worlds), but it develops the whole idea in a somewhat different way than other films of the genre and that is good. The protagonists manage to empathize and are credible (especially Ruby and Liam). The movie turns out to be just what fans of the genre like. It is sad that in its best moments, the movie goes too fast without really focusing on the images and content of these, because when these kinds of movies are filmed, it is required to take some risks in order to have a good product (we must remember that the world of the darkest minds can be interesting and exciting)."

      "text": "In addition to this movie just being flat out stupid, it's another exercise in 'ethnic absurdity' rather than diversity. In the US, the population is comprised of roughly 70% white people, 17% Hispanic, 12% black and 3% asian and .03% Indian. That means in a room of 100 people - 70 would be white , 17 hispanic, 12 blacks, 3 asians and almost 1 indian. Going to the movies and watching this piece of crap movie and unrealistic/absurd version of reality where asians, blacks, whites and indians are all EQUALLY present is just annoying. Hollywood needs to stop. Just make a decent movie and stop worrying about what minority is represented. BTW -- I didn't see ONE gay character??? They make up 10% of the population!!  I want next Superman to be Asian, and lex Luther to be gay and black and Lois Lane to a be transexual."

      "text": "This movie is jumping on the YA trend about 2 years too late. It's based on a series of books about yet another dystopian future, where young people are singled out for their gifts,..but not in a good way. There are some OK special effects and passable action, but too much of the plot is taken up by the romance between the 2 leads (Amandla Stenberg & Harris Dickinson). Even though they're compelling enough, these scenes drag down the momentum. Overall, it's a decent adventure for the intended audience, but breaks no new ground. NOTE: The ending doesn't conclude, but leaves you hanging for the sequel."

What surprised me most here is the story is approximately empathy science fiction.  The lead does surprising things with empathy. I think another movie too humanistic, too sensitive, too much about Feelings for the average critic.  Go see it."

This is the most generic YA novel adaptation ever. This is pandered to post-millennials. This was one of the worst movies of 2018. The acting from the cast is bad and with a horrible cast like this, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised. The action is dull. The visual effects are terrible. The writing is horrific. The directing is terrible. The characters are so painfully generic and uninteresting. The cast is horrible. This movie has Amandla Stenberg and Mandy Moore in it, so it was always guaranteed to suck. They\u2019re both terrible actresses, especially Stenberg. Amandla Stenberg is an annoying, boring, and untalented actress who has absolutely no charisma at all. She is also very wooden.I am so happy that this horrible movie bombed so hard at the box office. If it bombed really hard with critics, then it definitely deserved to bomb really hard at the box office. The Darkest Minds is nothing more a super generic and very unoriginal snooze-fest was that copies a lot of other YA adaptations. The movie was a bore fest and with that god-awful cast, it was also a dork fest. This movie is so cliched that it is cringe-worthy and the characters are so stereotypical.Oh, and the ending is stupid."

I have an issue that because the book was pov, there was no narration unlike another movie i love called the host. That movie was perfect for detailing a pov petspective on a movie. I bloody well hope that disney make this a movie series thats as dark as the books and not make bad casting choices."
