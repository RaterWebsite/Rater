The end sequence that uses Wiz Khalifa's \"See You Again\" is perhaps one of the most tender moment in movies I've seen in a long time, which is so amped up because Paul Walker was not present in the completion of filming this movie due to his unfortunate death.  Seeing a character that was digitally entered into scenes at times was incredible because I never knew the difference.  Furious 7 will certainly please the fans of the series, and if you're an action movie connoisseur then this is an easy recommendation.

Although I never cared for the series of Fast and the Furious movies because I thought they were mostly about street racing, Fast and the Furious 7 really tugged at my heart because it was about family and friends. From the beginning of the movie up until the end it left me anxiously waiting on how the movie would end and how Paul Walker\u2019s character would exit the film. Walker passed away in a tragic car accident in 2013.  Before watching the film, I had a girlfriend tell me how her date was teary eyed towards  the end of the movie. My reaction was \u201cuh that is not cute.\u201d Little did I know that I was about to be snot faced and an emotional wreck. This movie had the right amount of humor.\rBy the first scene I could already tell the movie was going to have impeccable special effects. There was one scene were they drove the cars out of the plane; they were going sky diving while in the vehicles. The cars even had parachutes. WOW, who thinks of these things? I was like a kid watching all the super cool scenes. I was definitely impressed. One critic, on meteoritic.com wrote: \u201cthe movie plods along muscling through without much life or spirit.\u201d He clearly was not watching the same movie that the rest of us were watching. From the very start of the movie to the end, there was a smooth flow into the next scene.\rAt one point in the movie you could see the genuine and emotional tie that they had to Brian. Paul Walker\u2019s recent demise had plenty to do with why the emotion and tears at the end of the movie were so hard to watch for many movie goers. It added a warm and touching end to the movie. A specific scene in the movie that was so heart felt and emotional was when the group was saying bye. Dom( Vin Diesel) was saying good-bye to Brian (Paul Walker), but it almost felt like he was saying his good-bye to the character Brian and Paul Walker. It was as if the movie and reality had become mingled into one. Dom says, \u201cI used to say I live my life a quarter mile at a time and I think that's why we were brothers \u2014 because you did too. No matter where you are, whether it's a quarter mile away or half way across the world. The most important thing in life will always be the people in this room, right here, right now. Salute mi familia. You'll always be with me. And you'll always be my brother.\u201d Imagine being at a movie theater and hearing this right after watching two hours of action packed-humor.\rI gave this movie an A+.

Lastly, kudos for the amazing send-off to Paul Walker at the end! Furious 7 is a good, fun movie that merits being watched some more."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I really wanted to like this movie. There haven't been many in the series that I thought were really good. The first one is by far the best in my opinion and I believe that it has to do with the more limited budget forcing more realistic car sequences and more believable action. These types of movies need to get back to the type of chases that made Bullet and the French Connection chases classics that people still talk about.\r I thought having Statham in this movie was going to raise the fight sequences to the quality of movies like The Transporter, but I was wrong. Statham's talents were mostly wasted as were Tony Jaa's. They could have easily been replaced by just about anybody and nothing would have been different. These guys really should have been on opposite sides of this fight so an epic clash could be filmed.\r With Diesel doing voice acting in movies like Iron Giant and recently Guardians of the Galaxy, I feel like there is a very legitimate actor under all of that muscle that has been mostly overlooked or paired with bad scripts for most of his career. This is no real exception. All of the dialogue between him and Rodgriguez was cringe worthy and the filler dialogue between wasn't much better.\r The only thing I thought this movie got right was the tasteful tribute to Paul Walker. The way they handled it brought satisfactory closure to the character but leaves it open for further installments. Although, at this point, I must say unless they are willing to up the quality of the writing and get back to more realistic action (which can be just as entertaining) they should just stop now."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "After Fast & Furious 6, I thought that we really didn\u2019t need another F&F movie. Add the fact that the plot of Furious 7 is just Owen Shaw\u2019s brother (Deckard Shaw) seeking revenge, and Furious 7 seemed like a somewhat unwarranted movie. Not because I was tired of F&F movies, but because I thought there was no reason (at least story wise) to keep making them. (Of course, there was still the mystery of who killed Han, but that\u2019s beside the point.) Nevertheless, I was enticed by the trailers and TV spots for F7. The promise of more impossible car stunts and dumb, crazy action lured me in.\r The plot of F7 is as realistic as you can imagine, with lots of vehicular mayhem in Abu Dubai (that somehow doesn\u2019t get Dom & Co. in trouble?) and a dues ex machina computer program/MacGuffin that can track anyone, anywhere in a matter of seconds (called \"God's Eye\"). But these illogical things are typical of the Fast & Furious movies, and at this point I don\u2019t expect anything different. Due to this though, I\u2019ve heard people negatively compare the F&F franchise to the Transformers franchise. However, IMO the Transformers movies have become heartless, boring, cash grabs. On the other hand, the F&F franchise at least has MOMENTS of comedy, excitement, and true heart. The F&F stars are also likable, and relatable. After seeing these characters together for 7 movies, they\u2019re obviously more acquainted with each other than the average Hollywood movie cast. They have authentic chemistry.\r If anything, Furious 7 is a Michael Bay-esque movie done RIGHT. While many of the events in F7 are really ludicrous, the overall themes of the movie & franchise (family, loyalty, vengeance) help keep Furious 7 from feeling like bloated with CGI and one-liners.  Once again, the latest F&F film has been able to walk the line between just-for-fun, over-the-top popcorn flick and lazy, unimaginative Hollywood sequel. (Though I'm not sure that that will happen again.)\r I definitely had a fun and enjoyable cinematic experience when I was watching Furious 7. The action sequences were as ambitious and over-the-top as always. F&F 7 is determined to top all previous films, and it succeeds--but is that such a good thing? (Nevertheless, films are a type of escapism from our unfortunately too-realistic lives. So don\u2019t feel bad about giving Furious 7 a large amount of suspension of disbelief.) However, I think that this latest movie asked for too MUCH suspension of disbelief. How many more car crashes and shootouts can Dominic Toretto & Co. survive? Are you telling me that Dom stood his own against Deckard Shaw, when an entire Special Ops team couldn't? And why didn't the US government intervene at all when a weaponized DRONE was in Los Angeles, and when Dominic was driving a super-car through skyscrapers?\r I think it\u2019s fair to question the future of this franchise. Furious 7 actually managed to top Furious 6, but how will future films KEEP topping what has been done before?  F&F 8 won\u2019t be the same without Paul Walker (R.I.P). Brian O\u2019Connor was one of the main characters in the franchise, but Paul Walker has passed on. Will Dominic Toretto, Letty, Roman, Tej, and Hobbs be able to sustain this franchise by themselves?\r Also, some of the F&F family are still struggling to have meaningful dialogue, like Tyrese Gibson as Roman and \u2018Ludacris\u2019 Bridges as Tej. They both have too many one-liners. Besides that, some actors were little more than cameos to appeal to all demographics--like Tony Jaa (as the martial arts expert that Brian fights), Djimon Hounsou (as the leader of a band of militant mercenaries), Ronda Rousey, and Iggy Azalea. (By the way, also think we should\u2019ve gotten to know Ramsey a bit better.)\r As a whole though, forgiving some of F7\u2019s flaws, Furious 7 is an entertaining movie. It delivers on it\u2019s promise of big budget spectacle, and it also provides a send-off to Paul Walker. (To be honest, I did get slightly emotional during that final scene.)\r I have reviewed 40 movies (on Metacritic and IMDB) including the 2014 and 2015 films: The Divergent Series: Insurgent, Taken 3, The Interview, Exodus: Gods and Kings, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1, Dracula Untold, The Maze Runner, Nightcrawler, The Equalizer, The Expendables 3, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Guardians of the Galaxy, The Giver, Sharknado 2, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Transformers: Age of Extinction, Edge of Tomorrow, X-Men Days of Future Past, Godzilla, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, The Lego Movie, Divergent, Transcendence, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, and more.\r I also review other TV shows, such as: Agent Carter, Empire (2015), The Flash, Arrow (Season 3), Gotham, The Last Ship, Sleepy Hollow, Marvel's Agents of SHIELD (Season 1 and 2), The 100, I Wanna Marry Harry, Crisis, Gang Related, and more.

I am now acutely aware that there was nary a worthwhile cinematic moment I have missed in the entirety of this seven-film-long franchise. Don't misinterpret what I'm about to say. I'm not going to be broad or **** around what I mean to say so as to avoid making diehard fans of this franchise angry. This is a BAD movie. Not a good movie. Not an average movie. Furious 7 is a BAD movie. My brutality is warranted, I assure you.\r I'll begin with the positives, however few and far between they are. The most laudable aspect of Furious 7 is it's unintentional hilarity. This is also it's most egregious flaw. When I am reduced to stifling fits of laughter during a moment pitched DEAD serious, something is wrong. On the other hand, I can't deny that I had a blast tearing this to shreds. This is a film that wears it's heart on it's sleeve, and I'm probably a bit to blame for being such a cruel . But with a script composed almost entirely of action-movie catchphrases (lines like 'Woman, I am the calvary') and the realism of an Uwe Ball film (I found five planes skydiving from a carrier jet a pretty tasty bit of ludicrousness) I would advise anyone going to see this try to see the mockable quality of Furious 7 as a beacon of humor in what is otherwise a stone-faced watch. Legitimate attempts at laughs are something else entirely, so juvenile, half-hearted, and plain unfunny that they feel awkward and embarrassing (I'm looking at you Tyrese. Just shut up).\r Lin also manages to achieve fleeting instances of legitimate watchability. Some action scenes aren't too silly and some of the dialogue isn't ripe with cliches or bad jokes. The tone maintained throughout is refreshingly devoid of mean-spirited macho vibes, just idiotic ones. The only other mention of positivity I have is that Furious 7 doesn't offend too many sensibilities other than the cinematic. It's not homophobic or racist, like Michael Bay's films, it's just sexist.\r All that aside, Furious 7 is a god-awful seemingly-endless pummeling of explosions and machinery smashing machinery. I wouldn't take up an issue with it if it were filmed with clarity or some sense of artistry. The audio is cacophonous as hell, almost to the point of inducing migraines. The storyline is so ripe with plot-holes, I can't begin to dive into how devoid of logic the procession of events in this film are. Vin Diesel and co deliver their dialogue with such a lack of a enthusiasm, even though I'm sure they were more emotionally invested in this outing over the death of Paul Walker, they fail to show it.\r There is a memorial of Walker at the end that I should mention, which is a legitimately thoughtful, logical ending to his character's arc. It's fitting and respectful that he wasn't killed off. The recreations of Walker are noticeable, though. I appreciate the effort to sow him into the narrative, but you'll take note of his long silences and body doubles. It's a shame, both Walker's death and the repercussions it has on the franchise, particularly this transitional entry.\r The melodrama that Furious 7 pitches at the audience is almost soap-opera-level over-the-top. We aren't invested in these characters, period, and the amnesia storyline (apparently introduced in the sixth film) is unforgivably preposterous. Beyond unbelievable, it's plain cliched and dull. Boring, to be honest. And I shouldn't have that feeling about a film that involves high-octane vehicles crashing into each other.\r I refuse to accept that filmgoers should suspend their disbelief to the extent that Furious 7 demands them to. The fact that film critics have become so lenient to the point where films such as this garner higher aggregated scores than such films as Fight Club is appalling. There is better escapist entertainment out there if you feel like shutting your mind off and relaxing while imagery goes by without coherence. The dehumanization of female figures, inclusion of unfunny, awkward humor, lack of logic, and relentless vehicular mayhem make me feel like Michael Bay comparisons are not unwarranted, yet somehow not drawn by critics that refuse to demonize this level of thoughtless blockbuster entertainment. Avoid at all costs if you haven't yet seen a Fast & Furious film, if you already have, there's pretty much nothing to say."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "The movie is kinda mediocre, didnt stood up to the name of F&F Franchise name...\r I understand it is kinda tribute to Paul Walker and total respect there and last 5min's literally took my breath away.. but the movie didnt stood up to expectation, just no excitement through out the movie...weak story....\r Kinda disappointed as well, still worth one watch..."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "We were very exhausted after watching this movie of non-stop action.

The story itself is just what accessories ihrgend just as there is.\rGuest appearances of some women and men are also available.\rThe locations are chosen also top notch.\r Conclusion: Convincing the film boasting large car stunts, but with a weak story leaves many feathers."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Fast & Furious 7 is in my opinion the best movie in the series, which isn't really saying much considering the entire franchise is just above average. The action scenes were entertaining but there was just way too much of it, also some of these action scenes were complete rubbish. It was a very emotional and entertaining movie overall but it dragged on a bit too much. What i do like about this movie is the very likable cast, especially Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). Overall it's a good movie that i recommend to anyone with some time to kill."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "It was anicipating for this movies. But, It was really sadden me of Paul Walker death so much. I wish the next Furious will be dedicating to him since this was his last ride...\r The action dosen't seem to bother me...."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "I didn't think I was going to like this movie because generally speaking, I'm really not into these kinds of action flicks that are huge franchise based. But I wanted to see what all the hoopla was about.\r And boy oh boy, was it worth every penny I paid.\r To be honest, I almost fell asleep during the first third of the film. But by the time the plot took flesh and the action started I was bolted wide awake.\r Action-packed, engaging, sometimes even funny.\r I especially liked the tribute to Paul Walker at the end of the film. I didn't know of Paul Walker until he died, and I thought the tribute was a very nice touch."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Every Fast and Furious episodes in the series are most likely about cars and action scene, lack stories. Which isnt a bad thing, for some reason. I personally do not mind, although i enjoy a movie with better story. However this episode of the seires, which may be the very last we get to see paul walker again has probably the better story of the series and outside of the movie.\r The movie itself isnt that bad, nice action scene, really nice action scene. The story is alright, but considering a movie that is base of the characters' relationships (Family comes first, something I believe on) and cars. The movie it self is a personally taste, whether you like action more or story driven movies. I personally dont get why people dont like watching action movies, it still has a story. The quality of it is a debate for another day, but the entire F&F series actually tells a good story. Believe it or not, since its an action based film.\r However the biggest thing about this film is Paul walker-RIP. Paul walker passed away on November 30, 2013, at first I was sad, I was fascinated by how the movie is going to be developed when it was half done. But the pain didnt stay for long, considering im actually a huge Paul Walker fan. Now that the movie came out, wow. When you finsihed the movie, you realised that this is the last time Paul Walker will be in a movie and LUCKILY its the F&F franchise. Let that sink in, the last, very last, Paul walker's movie.\r Paul walker's impact on the franchise, is something worth applauds for. Not just the relationship with the cast but how well he represented his character. He did it so well, that you cannot imagine another actor playing Brian O'Conner. But at the end its the fact that he died 1.5 years ago from now, the whole cast was in tears because, one of their family just died.\r Family come first, that was what I learnt from the movie. Rest In Peace Paul Walker. You will be missed, in the movie and outside of the movie. To be honest, I dont really know what to write. Im extremely sad that this is the last time I get to see part of Paul walker again."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "If your expecting an excellent, in-depth story then don't bother. But then again, why are you watching a fast and furious film? As a newcomer to the series, I have to admit - it was dumb, but in a good way. Fast cars and exciting over the top gunfights made the whole experience just fun, comical and enjoyable. If you like explosions, guns, cars and destruction (and let's face it, who doesn't?) then you will love this film."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "The applause from everyone inside the IMAX theatre in CC Colombo in Lisbon Portugal at the end of the film summed it all up for me. I intend to watch this one again - definitely worth the watch and glad to see the \"old school\" come back into play here! Even though Paul Walker is no longer with us (R.I.P), I am definitely itching for the follow-up to this one - although there wasn't an ending spoiler (thank god for that! It made Brain's farewell that much more special) there are many lose ends that need ... a continuation :) 5 Star material for me! Action is Action - if you want to see mushy or overly technical films where you need to keep stimulating your brain to enjoy, sure, it's in the cinema next door.  Here, we just want it \"Fast and Furious\"! :D Bring it on!"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Fast 7 probably has the strongest story of all the F&F movies, as they tie up every loose end. Then there are the stunts, awesome, incredible and breath-taking. Fast 7 is one of the most entertaining movies you will see this year, so I suggest you grab some popcorn and get yourself a seat."}, {"rating": "1", "text": "I was never a fan of this franchise, except 5 and 6 and unfortunately this one was simply stupid. Basically is the same over and over with the \"family\" winning at the end...and the worse is that not even the action scenes entertained me because it were dumb and ridiculous. The acting is poor, the characters are pretty basic, there's nothing new in there, it has become simply annoying. They had Statham and Kurt Rusell but still their characters were badly constructed, The Rock should had way more screen time...And sorry to say this but i notice that CGI Walker was fake, but still i respect them for trying. Overall, don't expect nothing different, it's entertaining but pathetic. Just go watch it because of the last 5 minutes to pay your tribute to Walker and skip the rest...I really don't get why it has this score in Metacritic."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "This movie is literally One Liner: The Movie. I tried very hard to enjoy everything other than the explosions and set pieces, but come on with the writing and acting on display here. I know Johnson can act better. I know Diesel can act AND write a whole lot better, as he was really crappy here. But not a minute passed without some freaking terrible one-liner and some hamfisted dialogue. I like you Vin, you're an awesome guy, but you could have done a whole lot better here. I agree highly with the negative review claiming you need to enjoy motor oil in your popcorn to like this movie."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "As for me this flick was the best action film since Matrix. It was so amazing I do not want to visit movies for a long while. They managed to tie in story and amazing action together which is mostly unique to the video game industry. Entire movie was full of surprises and Jason Statham is a badass villan.\rThe synergy of all these famous actors is amazing. and the stunts were jaw dropping.\rThe only negative part about this movie was how packed the theater was.\rRIP Paul."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Furious 7 knows its dumb and rides it all the way. Its out of control and fun throughout, with action sequences that are clearly over the top but done well. Its tribute to Paul Walker gives the movie some heart and meaning mixed in between all the action."}], "recommendations": ["the_fate_of_the_furious", "mission_impossible_iii", "transporter_3", "jason_bourne", "salt", "xxx_return_of_xander_cage", "6_underground", "the_marine", "the_mechanic", "infinite", "kingsman_the_golden_circle", "need_for_speed", "the_a_team", "death_race", "bloodshot", "transformers_dark_of_the_moon", "vantage_point", "the_expendables", "crank", "wild_card", "transporter_2", "lockout", "poseidon", "the_expendables_3", "mad_max_fury_road"]}
