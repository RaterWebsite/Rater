      "rating": "9",
      "text": "Very powerful portrayal of a very scary woman. This is the best looking film of its genre I have seen in a very long time. The detective is a jerk, but I think that's the point for the payoff. Caroline Neron is amazing as the evil Countess Bathory. Or is it Countess Bathory? One wonders.... go see this for sure!"

      "text": "Absolutely steamy, erotic thriller. Not a campy slasher movie, but a serious cat-and-mouse mystery with a Basic Instinct kind of heat."

      "rating": "10",
      "text": "Too hot. Way sexed and crazy stuff. Caroline Neron is awesome as a killer. What's cool about this is that it's a really good mystery and every part of it is good."
