Cringeworthy caricatures of people you actually cared about and endless screen time from the Mafia Museum of Memes that you've seen a hundred times before. What a colossal waste of resources and talent."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "\u201cThe Many Saints Of Newark\u201d Is a decent Movie. But the main problem is the pacing and logic. Not only is this movie very short, but as a movie marketed around Tony Sopranos Origin, the movie has very little to do with him. Out of the Two Hour Runtime, he\u2019s in the movie for less than 30 minutes and does absolutely very little to advance the plot and move the story forward. The Story is very predictable, especially if you\u2019ve seen the series. The Movie has a lot of nostalgic call backs that only fans will understand and appreciate. Fan service is what carries this movie. For Example, We get to see a flashback from the show happen in the movie again. Or see Christopher as a baby. Or when Uncle Junior says that Tony doesn\u2019t have the makings of a varsity athlete. The Movie for some reason is narrated by Christopher, and  makes absolutely no sense. If Tony doesn\u2019t know the full story how can Christopher a baby in this movie, know exactly what happened. It\u2019s these kind of things that are only in the movie for fan service and if you think about it makes no sense. Overall This Movie is not very good, it\u2019s not the worst movie I\u2019ve seen this year far from it. But in terms to the amazing show that came before it, and it\u2019s legacy; this movie falls very short. And doesn\u2019t add many things to Newark\u2026"}, {"rating": "0", "text": "Nooooooo oooooooo ooo oooooo oooooooooooo oooooo oooooo ooooooooo oooooooooo"}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Some beautiful shots, but felt like a Scorsese film I bought from wish. I can't think of a single reason why this movie exists. The only reason I watched it was because of the show, but outside the beginning of the first act it could be any generic American Italian mob movie. I was left puzzled during the second act and by the third act, I created a Metacritic account to give this a 3/10."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "When your heroes let you down. I had such a high expectations for this movie and as someone who loves the Sopranos, I cannot fathom how David Chase thought this was good or in any way needed. The story is weak and never really revolves around anything although it tries to, it rehashes too many things from the TV series and in no way adds to the character development in terms of what we already knew from the show. There is only one plot twist and even that is kind of lame. Whoever portrayed Uncle Junior was terrible."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "I felt like the story didn't really have substance to it. I have seen all Sopranos episodes and this felt like they are just capitalizing on Sopranos from past. Yes some characters were interesting to see how they were shown in past but the story itself felt like very random and not much about it. Especially it wasn't even much about Tony and how he became who he was - ok even if it was not the idea, the story was still very simplistic. Even the racial aspect which at first it felt they wanna show in those times, eventually ended up only scratched upon a bit. Also the slang felt like not natural there but put in everywhere possible.  I am giving it a 5 because for me it was watchable and was interesting to see Sopranos characters and how they were made in past, but I really wonder for casual watcher, who havent seen Sopranos, is it really that interesting."}, {"rating": "5", "text": "This is not a movie. It is a 2 hour introduction to a prequel Sopranos series. It's fine. It relies too heavily on the viewer having seen the Sopranos and acts as a greatest hits of some of the stories told in the series. It's just another \"remember this?\" nostalgia trip. Jon Bernthal is a terrible actor who cannot get even close to matching the charisma needed to play Johnny Soprano. The other actors were fine, but the guy playing Dickie Moltisanti was soooo forgettable."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "It's pretty whatever. Burns kind of slow, which isn't bad for a mobster movie per se, but the fiery scenes just didn't hit. A conflict would be resolved in the next scene or two. Some of the acting was great, some of it was uh not so great. The setting itself was almost incredibly interesting but failed to fully bring the gravity of the situations at hand in the late 60's early 70's. Overall it was fun to watch as prequel, but not a great mob movie. If I hadn't loved the show I probably would've liked this movie less."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "They ruined Junior.There is no plot. If you aren't a Sopranos fan you'll be lost with the characters.There is basically 0 character development. Sil was pure garbage. Bernthal should stick to single minded angry characters. No range at all. Racism is a backdrop, but even that's not consistent. It's neither \"woke\", yet it's barely \"edgy\". It is lukewarm, lazy.The B plot is of no value to the main story. Honestly, the worst episode of the Sopranos is better than this, barring the pilot. We put David Chase on a pedestal as if \"Not Fade Away\" doesn't exist. Now this. I'll keep this short and sweet. The writing is weak. The plot is outta control. And John Magaro has become an embarrassment to himself and everybody else."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "One of the worst movies in Human history. I can't even find anything good about thing. I really don't understand how Hollywood went this bad."}, {"rating": "6", "text": "\"THE MANY SAINTS OF NEWARK\" is a decent movie that does not live up to the standards of the Sopranos in terms of dialog, drama, acting, humor or character/story development. That doesn't mean it isn't a decent movie. For any Sopranos fan this movie is a must see, and although Tony's background is not the center of the story, it does give insights into the social environment prior to the Sopranos. Some key mistakes ruin the immersion, such as consistently not correctly pronouncing Moltesanti or the absolut terrible acting by the actors who portrayed Sil, Junior or Johnny - then again those characters are hard to re-enact. Not the worse acting I have seen, but not good enough for a Sopranos prequel."}, {"rating": "0", "text": "This movie is beyond just bad, it's disrespectful. David Chase and everyone else who wrote and produced this train wreck had to know that there were going to be two main audiences for this film. The biggest and most interested were going to be fans of the TV series. The other audience was going to be those that were casual, or non watchers of the Sopranos. The fans were anxious for this film and have been loyally waiting for almost two years. The latter audience had been hearing about the Sopranos from the first group for years and were probably willing to see what all the hype was about. As a member of the first group, I did my best to tamp down my own personal expectations as I know it was going to be hard for them to reproduce the quality of the series in a two hour movie. I get that. However, I did expect Chase (who is always so condescending to the world about how he handled the series), would at least give it an honest effort? This is why I say it was disrespectful because they just threw together this piece of garbage and expected real fans to just be grateful we got anything? I wish they never did this movie, it only takes away from just how good the series was. There are so many flaws in this movie, I wouldn't have enough space to write it all out. The story was not only lame, disjointed and at times boring as hell, but in the end made zero sense? Most of the acting was just people attempting poor impressions of the characters. Sil and Paulie were especially bad. The film's good character acting: Dickie, Liv and the Italian girl were wasted by the silly plot and incoherent dialogue. Ray Liotta was cringe worthy. They did a decent job with the cars, clothes and street scenes but it was all wasted as you couldn't make heads or tails of how any of it fit together. The last thing is that there is nothing about this film that will appeal to the new non Soprano fan. Just a waste of two hours."}, {"rating": "2", "text": "If you're a Sopranos fan, don't bother, this is really bad.

Sold as a prequel, it was almost entirely the story of Dikie Moltasanti (Christopher's father), with some formative Tony Soprano sprinkled in. If it wasn't over the top trying to shoehorn in every reference from the TV series it could, it was just badly written, and badly cast.

I was definitely interested checking this one out, considering that 'The Sopranos' is by far my all-time favorite TV series. It's a masterpiece and I loved every single episode of it from start to finish. I went in, however, with not too high expectations with this, considering that film follow-ups to TV shows usually aren't too stellar, and it's a good thing that I didn't, cause I'm certain it would've hindered my enjoyment of this film a lot. While it was definitely an intriguing and worthwhile watch, it definitely doesn't hold a candle to the TV show and the epic legacy that it created. This film is fine in its own right, and the cast, particularly Alessandro Nivola and Michael Gandolfini (taking on his late father James' iconic role of Tony Soprano) really shines here as well. The story, however, feels a little too been there done that as far as mob and gangster stories go. It's the same as the rest and nothing we really haven't seen before, which kind of makes the film feel somewhat underwhelming by the end. But overall, the cast does an excellent job, and it certainly did bring back a lot of Soprano nostalgia to me, even if the script and story felt a little lacking and uninspired and couldn't come close to living up to the masterpiece of a show that inspired it."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Brings nothing new to the universe of the Sopranos, Tony barely appears 20 minutes in the movie and sadly Michael Gandolfini lacks charisma, young Sil was acted like some kind of a comedy sketch, not to mention they wasted half of the movie on some non-relevant storyline regarding the conflict with the blacks, just so they can air some woke propaganda. As a standalone movie this would barely be a 3/10, but I'll give it 4 for some show references and some stories from the show which were reenacted, like the one where Johnny shoots the gun through Livia's bun, which was hilarious."}, {"rating": "3", "text": "Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad"}, {"rating": "2", "text": "This movie is absolutely terrible. The story is incoherent, the casting is uneven at best,(they couldn't find a bald dude shorter than 6' to play Junior?

Hell, even the voiceover by dead Christopher is poorly written. I can't even imagine what someone who had never seen Sopranos would think of this movie. Special shout out to Ray Liotta for not only showing basically no acting range, but also not even attempting to feign an Italian accent playing an Italian immigrant."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Great movie.

You're trying to FOLLOW about 70 one-hour episodes of the MAFIA spanning the entire decade of the 2000s (The Sopranos) with a measly 2-hr PREQUEL with COMPLETELY fresh characters and you thought this would satisfy THAT fanbase. This was marketed as a TONY SOPRANO origin story but about 20 minutes in I didn't care one bit about Fat Little Tony and only wanted to explore Dickie, The Ray Liotta character, the new black guy, Tony's mother. What a fascinating world and 10x harder to pull of than The Sopranos cuz they're making a period piece as opposed to Sopranos unfolding in real time (with no special sets clothes cars etc).  I hope the plan all along was to make this its own thing much like the Star Treks: it started with Kirk & Spock but entire franchises blossomed from this to the point that you had complete new universes that didnt need to reference back to Kirk & Spock and the Enterprise to succeed.

It's obviously well made. Good sets costumes and acting. Great music. I finally realized, like the Irishman, that it just was not very interesting. It's difficult to say about a well-made movie. But if the Godfather is a 7, the Many Saints of Newark is a 5. It's missing the good performances, has a generic storyline, and embarrassingly, budget songs from the Rolling Stones and Van Morrison that you've never heard of.Perhaps the biggest crime of all, it ignores the most interesting storyline of all: a black underling of the mob named Harold (Odam Jr.) decides to Branch out on his own and comes into conflict with the crime family.

While I have seen reviews touch on how this movie is offensive to Italian Americans, I will not touch on that as I am not a part of that group and I cant have any input on it , but the race thing was overused in the movie just with a message of showing that the characters are racist and kinda creates tension. The movie should've been made into a mini show because in the 2 hour screen time you wouldn't even grow any sort of attachment to those characters,  they all seemed one dimensional, all wasn't too captivating which is understandable because even when you watch a show you need at least 4 episodes to start getting to know those characters and in this movie it just didn't do it. By the end of it I still didn't care about Dickey. The only upside of this movie is how it shows you that Junior was always a spiteful maniac and it puts a lid on Dickey's death, and casting choices were all good until it got to Silvio. I am a long time Sopranos fan and i was looking so forward to watch this and it resulted in a huge disappointment especially if you're looking for a Sopranos quality film.

No, we won't get 2-3 seasons to watch a teenage Tony Soprano grow up and learn the ways of the Mob from his late Uncle or his Father or his other Uncles and friends, but we still got that stron Sopranos storyline and character arcs.  As a fan of the Sopranos family this movie made sense and worked for me. I loved the backstories, especially meeting Chris's Mom, and Christophers twin grandfathers.

At the center is Dickie Moltisanti (Alessandro Nivola), an influential member of one crime family and a strong influence on the young Tony Soprano (played by Michael Gandolfini, the son of James, the original Tony). This film doesn\u2019t work well alone. If you didn\u2019t know about the future trajectory of this group, you\u2019ll be waiting for the story to get started. It lays out a tumultuous time in 60\u2019s New Jersey, when race riots and competing gangs were at the forefront. Sure, there are fascinating performances (Vera Farmiga\u2019s mother wonderfully echoes Nancy Marchand\u2019s original) and some blasts of violence, but the writing never coalesces into anything more than a prequel.

It is however, interesting enough, if you like the genre,and you stick with it, but it lacks a cohesion that brings it together, and feels disjointed at times, but with some worthwhile scenes. Nivolas acting is quite good, and seeing Tony's upbringing and mentor was worth it to see, again, in a far from perfect film, with a number of flaws.

Added to that I kept getting confused about who was who and if I hadn't read that a youthful Artie Bucco and Jackie Aprile and **** Bonpensiero were supposed to be in the show . . .

The casting choices are bizarre. Worst of all, and I hate to use this word, it's boring.Nivola is a good actor but he's not convincing as Dickie Moltisanti. None of the characters in Many Saints get an arc or proper development, and as a result, there's no real emotional pay-off in key moments.One of the best cinematic moments is when Dickie kills his Goomar by the beach, which is promptly diminished by an inappropriate, Zach Snyder-esque, needle drop.
