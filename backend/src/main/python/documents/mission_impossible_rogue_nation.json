With a fresh script from writer and director Chirstopher Mcquarrie and fine acting by Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, Rebecca Ferguson and Alec Baldwin, Mr. Cruise performs admirably in his role as leader of the IMF. The film is fast paced with breathtaking action scenes and a plot that keeps unraveling at the same speed as the action on the screen. Rumored to have performed many of the action scenes himself, Mr. Cruse is the definitive action hero. Although slightly over 2 hours in length, the viewer is never concerned about that because he or she is too busy following what is taking place on the screen.

Movies that feature a lot of movement and action scripting don't always try to do anything too elaborate/interesting, and that can be the make/break of a movie like this.

It's also a bit more action-paced than recent \"thinking\" spy flicks like Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy (which, incidentally, I enjoyed tremendously).  It hits a nice middle-ground between the two extremes and results in an enjoyable movie with familiar characters, an understandable plot, low-body-count action, and a satisfying conclusion.\rIn this installment, the IMF is back to doing what it does best \u2013 defending the world from certain annihilation while working without the cover of government protection or authority (again\u2026where does the money come from?).  Ethan Hunt is off the radar, staying one step ahead of the CIA and one step behind his enemy until he is able to reunite his team to do the \u201cImpossible\u201d (thus the title, right?).  There isn\u2019t a lot of new territory here, and \u201cThe Syndicate\u201d doesn\u2019t sound all that different from the version of SPECTRE we\u2019ll be seeing later in the year.  However, it is well-crafted and well-executed, and is therefore a good example of what movies do best \u2013 escapist and enjoyable.\rThis could be a personal opinion, but \"Rogue Nation\" felt much more like the original movie than any of the others in the series.  Not only do we have an explicit reference to the original NOC-list heist, but the movie\u2019s locations, lighting, and pacing lend it the same air of foreign charm that helped separate the original from predecessor Bond and Bourne movies.  While the movie drags in spaces, there are a few scenes which are balletic in their execution \u2013 the complicated \u201cchase\u201d scene above the Vienna Opera House being the most obvious example.\rAll in all, enjoyable and recommended."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The Tom Cruise lead Mission Impossible movies have become a pretty reliable franchise over the years and, with some standout action set pieces and a suitably outlandish plot, Rouge Nation doesn\u2019t disappoint."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Tom Cruise really does risk his life in the opening scene of this movie. It is not an optical illusion or a stunt man. It is Cruise himself hanging on for dear life to the side of an airplane that has taken off and become airborne. However, he has been harnessed so that if he had slipped in the filming, he would have presumably survived, falling only a few feet before being secured. But how many actors could perform that stunt even with a harness? One gets the impression that Daniel Craig takes an island vacation when it's time to film the stunts\u2014he relies on a professional double to do the risky stuff.\r This film may at times be a little overwhelmed by the many chase scenes, but the plot keeps the audience guessing about which double agent is betraying whom. Cruise's character, the indefatigable Ethan Hunt, is a man who has a guardian angel sitting on his shoulder so that no real harm can ever befall him. He is a strict purist, a defender of the peace, a human superhero, and as the CIA head (Alec Baldwin) puts it, \u201cthe living manifestation of destiny.\u201d (A few critics commented on the guffaws provoked by this line\u2014nobody laughed at my showing in Montreal, but oddly enough, at the end of the film there was a round of applause.) In short, Hunt is to spies as the Dalai Lama is to Buddhist monks.\r The IMF (Impossible Mission Force) is trying to stop the latest incarnation of evil, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), from assassinating all the heads of state as part of a master plan conducted by the Syndicate, an international crime network. Lane is an insanely criminal mastermind, and in no time at all, he has Hunt captured and hanging by his wrists in a torture chamber. Even Hunt cannot escape from this dilemma until a beautiful double agent, Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) enters the room and miraculously releases him. Like Hunt, she is unflappable, invincible, and incorrigible. She is neither Bond girl, nor Bourne girl, nor any kind of girl. Ilsa Faust defies categorization. She is unique.\r Thus begins a bizarre relationship between the two spies based on mutual respect, mutual desire for self-preservation, and mutual attraction, although consummate professionals that they are, they keep their distance from each other. Romance is clearly for mere mortals, a weakness that disciplined ninja-like warriors cannot afford to indulge. For them being impassioned means that you would do anything to save the world, whereas more carnal inclinations are to be derided as juvenile distractions.\r In the end we have what has been termed the American answer to James Bond, and though Ethan Hunt is somewhat lacking in that droll British elegance, our roll-up-your-sleeves kind of folksy spy is actually more appealing. In a world where everyone has been speculating for years about who is going to replace Daniel Craig as the next 007, no one ever asks who is going to replace Tom Cruise. There's a reason for that\u2014he is incontestably irreplaceable. Fortunately, Liam Neeson has set a new precedent with the Taken series, where aging spies who just want to retire are forced back into action because they are simply too good to hang out their gone fishin' sign. Neeson still inspires admiration at 63. Cruise is only 53, and like the character of Ethan Hunt, he can only get better with age."}, {"rating": "7", "text": "Rogue Nation is a nice return to form for the Missions, with a good story and some really clever sequences."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "As advertised, non-stop action and the typical MI story with many twists and turns.

Some of the scenes in Rouge Nation felt a bit too long, which would've been better if they shortened some of it. The action was great, just like the previous films, it was very suspenseful and engaging. The new girl in this movie was freaking awesome, because she was tough and  sexy at the same time.

(I\u2019ve been a bit disappointed with some recent blockbusters this year, which I\renjoyed but know could\u2019ve been better.)  But I was thoroughly happy to be proven wrong when I saw Mission: Impossible--Rogue Nation.\r **Tom Cruise gives his 100% as IMF agent Ethan Hunt--fully embracing the role and doing all the stunts. **Benji (Simon Pegg) is funny (didn\u2019t expect him to be playing CoD at work). He\u2019s juxtaposed well with the slightly cynical and weary Hunt, as he\u2019s more naive and not battle-hardened. **Rebecca Ferguson is convincing in her role--she\u2019s not frail or weak, she\u2019s athletic and actually sort of muscular. She\u2019s not overly sexualized, made a love interest, or a victim.\r **We get an interesting character in Alec Baldwin\u2019s Alan Hunley, director of the CIA--who doesn\u2019t trust the IMF. Director Hunley has gravitas, and he has screen presence. You wonder whether or not he\u2019s helping the Syndicate. **William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) and Luther (Ving Rhames) both needed more screentime.\r The movie kicks off with a big stunt (apparently done by Cruise himself). Once the action starts, it doesn\u2019t let up. Chasing after a MacGuffin and the Syndicate leads Cruise from one location to another, with various members of his team showing up to assist along the way.\r If you want to be judgemental, nothing in \u2018Mission Impossible 5\u2019 is over-the-top or mindblowing (in terms of the script and action sequences), but the movie is better than most other films in both of those departments. The script and action scenes are smart, relying more on suspense than eye-candy. Director Christopher McQuarrie succeeds where most have struggled, in terms of balancing a decent script, action, comedy, and characters. The cinematography and editing is well done (as showcased in the Vienna opera scene).\r I definitely wouldn\u2019t say that \u2018Rogue Nation\u2019 was too predictable or a bore. I really enjoyed myself when I watched the movie. Action, suspense, sharp dialogue, and humor make the film a treat. The cast helps give the film a contagious and exhilarating energy. I honestly was surprised by some of the film's twists. (But it should be noted that I\u2019m new to the franchise.)\r I think \u201cRogue Nation\u201d deserves a 10, and not because it\u2019s perfect. The villain wasn\u2019t that memorable, and characters like Luther and Brandt needed more screentime. Nevertheless, it\u2019s the closest a 2015 action film has been to a 10 (at least for me). Director Christopher McQuarrie manages to make old tropes feel fun again, and balance a lot of components to make a great, enjoyable film.\r I have reviewed 43 movies (on Metacritic and IMDB), some recent ones, including: Minions (Despicable Me spin-off), Avengers: Age of Ultron, Fast and Furious 7, The Divergent Series: Insurgent, Taken 3, and more. I also review TV shows."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "This is another great addition to the Mission: Impossible franchise and it's one of the best movies of this summer, although I'd say that I enjoyed this MI a little less than its predecessor because it has a lack of memorable action sequences, although it has two great sequecences, one with a lot of water and other with a high-speed motorcycle pursuit.

At this point, there's no denying that Tom Cruise is one of my favorite action stars in Hollywood. He makes Ethan Hunt not only look like a total badass, but also a vulnerable man, and that's what I really like about him. The action, as I said, it's phenomenal and the set-pieces are visually striking, with the \"underwater\" scene being the most impressive element in the film. There was also a few character drama and comedy, but not with a confusing, clich\u00e9d romance. Some stuff about the female character just seemed off when it came to what side she was on. That's further answered in the second half of the movie, but I still feel they could have fleshed the character more. You can bring up that they didn't want to reveal the girl's true motivations because they wanted the viewers to keep guessing, but that literally has been done before in previous installments, so yeah, in my opinion, it's kind of clich\u00e9d. There are also some moments that are very dumb and not credible at all. Seriously, in the beginning, Ethan enters in the plane and the wind just throws him to the wall with impact and somehow he survives? And during that chase scene in Morocco, the car does a few flips and they survive? Hmm. Nonetheless, \"Rogue Nation\" surprised in how much spectacle the movie could have.

This time around, his organization is under fire by CIA boss, Alec Baldwin, and a Senate Sub-committee voting to disband the IMF, stating most of their successes are based off of Luck than actual tactics. Hunt and his team have faced overwhelming odds in past film; from their own leader going rogue, to stopping a super virus, to a really mad Philip Seymour Hoffman, to stopping a nuke mid-air after accidentally blowing up the Kremlin. Now with no more IMF or governmental support, Ethan Hunt is searching for the secret organization that possibly has ties to everything thats happened in the past, known only as \"The Syndicate\" which also has infiltrated the IMF at its heart, and Ethan can only trust his team; Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Jeremy Renner. The rest of the films usually introduces a larger cast of team members who inadvertently die on missions or from treachery, but this time its just returners. But this film isn't just about the boys, the female lead.. and really, only woman in the movie, Ilsa Faust played by Rebecca Ferguson (who i thought was Michelle Monaghan at first) does her fair share of asskicking, double / triple crossing... its really kind of hard to tell whose team she's on. There's almost a love story between Hunt and Faust, but Ethan is still married or has a fianc\u00e9 but she's never addressed, he just let her go at the end of Ghost Protocol.\r Mission Impossible: Rouge Nation is the most fun Mission Impossible ever. It offers epic action sequences, gorgeous locations and big laughs. There's no real character growth or anything, just procedural action sequences, Rogue Nation knows exactly what it is, it's more, more adventure, more humor, more excitement. You know who everyone is, and you know you'll probably never see the female lead again as seems to be the case with M:I female leads, which is sad, because Ferguson carries most of the film. Her character, Faust is the central source of pathos, as her life hangs in the balance, being played with by her government and the baddies and the only person she can trust is Ethan Hunt. Jeremy Renner reprises his role as Brandt, taking the backseat in most of the excitement, Ving Rhames's Luther gets more field time and shows why he's best the guy offsite, while Simon Pegg's Benji is more confident in his role as a hacker turned field agent. Though the centerpointe for all the action is Tom Cruise, whether he's flushing himself down a giant toilet, escaping an opera house, in a motorcycle chase through Morocco or hanging off the side of a cargo plane, there's little Ethan Hunt can't accomplish.\r While Rogue Nation has a stand-alone feel, its also a direct sequel to Ghost Protocol. Never before in a Mission Impossible movie have they ever addressed what happened in any movie before, this one recaps what new audience members may have missed in films past, while also never mentioning what happened with any other members of the IMF. But I can live with that, if I want to see gorgeous set pieces, insane action sequences, Tom Cruise risking his life and Simon Pegg making fun of everything, I'll gladly come back to the theatre for more Mission Impossible films if they just focus on. Where the film felt a bit lacking to me, was in the gadget department. Mission Impossible movies are known for their amazing tech. In Ghost Protocol, the BMW i8 that Ethan drives to the Indian Billionaire's party in, I thought we would never see, it looked too futuristic; In Los Angeles the i8 is everywhere now. While all the heroes drive Bimmers (and one Range Rover) the only cool car thing is a biometric reader on the drivers side window to lock and unlock the car. That seemed cool, and a way to get smudgy windows. The only other cool toy was an automatic lockpick credit card, there were a few unorthodox firearms in the film as well, but no exploding gum, no laser watches or dynamite pens (granted a few of those are Bond staples, but still).\r Go see Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation\r Film Grade : B"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "By the time the fifth installment of a movie franchise rolls around, that series starts to show its age.

Really enjoyed this movie, even though the ending could've had a bit more action and something more to it, but otherwise pretty great action movie!"}, {"rating": "8", "text": "Great effects, brilliant action sequences and an immersive story prove that Christopher McQuarrie can match it with directors such as Brad Bird and JJ Abrams. In fact, McQuarrie provides the best Mission Impossible film yet. The opening scene sets the tone for a spectacular ride. A ride filled with twist and turns and simply outrageous entertainment likely to keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Definitely one of my favorite action  movies of all time absolute genius film making! One of the best endings ever! Rebecca Ferguson was really amazing in this as was Tom Cruise of course."}, {"rating": "8", "text": "The fifth Mission Impossible , was more exciting than I saw , especially the scene where Tom Cruise , or say ( in secret and affection ) \" Tomsito \" made \u200b\u200bwell risky and was subject of a plane flying and from the outside , who the hell I could think to do that ?, but the other more charm , good stunts that action certainly leaves us more Mission Impossible emotions with more deliveries"}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Like the trailer of this movie said, ready or not here they come. And BOOM - here comes Rogue Nation, and boy - did it come with a bang. Let me just say right off the bat that, this is probably my favorite Mission Impossible film\u2026by far.\r Gone are the days that you\u2019d need slow motion, flying white doves or lens flairs to make a Mission Impossible film interesting, this brand new installment of the franchise rejuvenises the aging series in an explosive and exciting way. What I like about the Mission films is that, much like the Harry Potter and James Bond movies, each installment of the series brings something different and refreshing, thanks to their ever changing directors. And like the Marvel films, each Mission Impossible embodies a different action genre.\r I have to admit, I wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of Jack Reacher. It was an okay action film that didn\u2019t do much else for me. So when the announcement was made that Christopher McQuarrie was directing the fifth mission impossible I was a little skeptical. Even after I saw the trailer I still had my reservation toward the finished product. I mean I have so much respect for JJ Abrams and Brad Bird that the inner nerd in me, sorta-kinda wished they had picked someone with a better track record. With all that said, the first five minutes into this movie I was convinced that my months and months of worries were for nothing. Like I was sold. I can honestly say right now that this is the best mission impossible film to date.\r Now, my biggest issue with Ghost Protocol was that although it was very entertaining, it didn\u2019t have that edge on your seat suspense like Mission 3 did, and that plus a weak and generic villain robbed away some of the potentially intense moments. This time around, we have a formidable villain who is someone even Ethan refers to during one very nail-biting scene as \u201chis equal\u201d. And his plan is pretty screwed up. He\u2019s not the in your crazy, in your face villain, he\u2019s soft spoken and civil and that\u2019s what makes him so **** dangerous because throughout the film I had this feeling that he was this time bomb waiting to explode. He really raised the stake of the game, and the audience despised him for that, I know I did, when I wanted someone to show him who\u2019s boss, like, I wanted him to be taught a lesson in the end. When a villain gets the audience to feel that way, it\u2019s usually a sign that it\u2019s a very well written character.\r Another well-written character is newcomer to the series, Rebecca Ferguson. I didn\u2019t know who she was before this film. But now, oh yeah. She was such a badass in this movie. Not only that, but she is not your typical Mission Impossible filler girl, she is an actual person with a pretty neat character development and story arc. It\u2019s been a while since the Mission series had a female character with substance and also knows how to kick ass. Her character is such a breath of fresh air that it made an already top-notch movie even more exciting. One of the highlights of the film, in my opinion.\r Of course, then you have the returning characters from the previous movies like Benji, Brandt and Luther who were more or less the side characters but were still pretty much in the picture. They are mostly responsible for the comic relief moments of the movie. And the genuine camaraderie among these characters just makes this team really great. Like you want to root for them to win.\r The biggest thing I like about the direction Chris McQuarrie took the movie is that, it\u2019s acknowledging the fact that this is an aging franchise. It managed to make references to all four previous Mission Impossible movies, and as a long time fan I feel like this was a very a smart move. With the exception of James bond, when a franchise that stretches to as long as 20 years, it usually screams been there done that. But Mission Impossible manages to avoid all that which is very neat.\r Of course, while the movie handled the characters pretty well, its action sequences are just as stellar. Apart from tom cruise dangling in midair on an airplane, a stunt he actually performed himself, there were many other spectacular action scenes, notably, a stunt-filled, high-speed freeway chase that not only provided a neat little throwback to the motorcycle chase from Mission 2, but also kept me holding my breath from its sheer action galore. There is an underwater sequence with no music in the background which really threw the audience into the movie itself and that was breathtakingly intense. This movie probably has the best action scenes in the entire franchise.\r The movie for me is a perfect blend of all four previous Mission Impossibles, and everything just flows so well and fits together seamlessly. I was still thinking about this movies hours after seeing it on opening weekend. It\u2019s what a summer action blockbuster should be, and it\u2019s what every mission impossible fan deserves."}, {"rating": "9", "text": "Despite all the negative attention Tom Cruise has found himself in, he still manages to charm in movies with the latest Mission Impossible movie. And just like the franchise, Tom shows no signs of slowly down, even with age catching up to them both.\rAll the actors do pretty well (especially Simon Pegg, as he almost always does) but even the minor characters do surprisingly well. The stunts? As spectacular as ever. Nothing truly \"tops\" the skyscraper scene in Ghost Protocol, but there is more then enough action to keep you interested. The fight scenes are fantastically shot, but sadly lacking next to any Marvel movie in recent times. But, what the film lacks in fist fights, it makes up for in unexpected laughs and frantic, edge-of-your-seat moments.\rAs far as the movies plot goes, this is not a Christopher Nolan film. There aren't any twists or turns to leave you scratching your head, and almost every \"reveal\" I had predicted. But, for a mindless good time, I cant think of a better alternative."}, {"rating": "10", "text": "Rogue Nation is totally the best in the Mission Impossible franchise. Much better than the preceder, Ghost Protocol.
