Personally I like football a lot, which makes this movie even more appealing to me. And the fact that it's all based on actual events from 1971, makes this movie to what it is; a masterpiece! A must-see!!"

I am white and the school was integrated.  I was a cheerleader (one of three white girls and two  black girls).   I developed friendships with white and black.... and there were white schoolmates that Chastised me.  However my family (who I would never imagine at that age, were not prejudice ,,,hmmm)  my parents met my friends and it didn't matter their color, but they met them as a human being.  This is what this movie is about."

The acting here is very well and you almost feel yourself getting emotional during the intense moments in this movie aside from Denzel Washington and Will Pattons great performances."

The story being true and my love of sports drove this on to the bank for me. The critics boorish and childish admonishments are clearly screwed along geo-political lines as the contrast between ACTUAL viewers and snotty reviewer prejudices could not be more clear here."

      "text": "RTT is a movie that tries to fit 2 things in one movie: Racial Desegregation and Titans football, but fails to do justice to either. The movie is an inspiring one as all sports movie tend to be, but if you are a tough nut to crack, you may start yawning at some places. It is quite predictable if you look at the movie objectively. There's the first half with all the good-for-nothing individuals, inspiration, motivation and boot camp training. Then there's the second half with the initial hardships, near losses, the inspired masterstroke and the big final win. But thanks to the racial undertone, the proceedings are dramatic enough to watch.The script is inconsistent that is it is too weak/lame at some points but very strong in other instances. Almost all energy has been put into making sure that everything looks right from the outside. Individual characterizations are poor and it shows in the actors' performance. Some scenes are written beautifully but some scenes fail to impress. The director Boaz Yakin too surprisingly sticks with the script and doesn't explore the many possible angles.Denzel Washington does an amazing job at the centre playing the insanely tough and bullish coach, Herman Boone. Will Patton who plays his calm deputy Bill Yoast is passive in the first half (thanks to the poor writing) but comes to the foreground and gives an acceptable performance as the movie progresses. Wood Harris and Ryan Hurst share a great chemistry and give believable combined performances playing leaders of the black and white bandwagon respectively.The football scenes are a treat to watch. Make sure you know the jargon and tactics of football because if you don't enjoy them, you are gonna miss half the fun. Everything from the warm ups, the handful play sequences, the individual player's sacrifice for the good of the tea and the exchange between the coaches. The choreographer (if its the right word) deserves a round of applause for his work. Watch it if you are a fan of Denzel Washington or if you want to discover the meaning of team spirit. Watch the movie expecting exactly whats present in it and you will be impressed and walk out completely satisfied. But if you randomly walk in hoping to see something a class apart from others, this one will be a bit of a disappointment. But all in all, the experience will be worth 'remembering'...well at least for sometime."

My final score is 71.8 out of 100."

Denzel Washington is not exactly but he seems to tone himself down because there are points in the film where he does not need to be the star of the show. All the members of the cast undergo some significant development in this movie and its a true inspiration."
