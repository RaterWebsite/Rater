      "text": "Now, if you're expecting more than blood, gore and death from this third installment in the Final Destination saga and hope for something resembling a plot line, then stay out. You will be disappointed.In all fair and vague shortness, Final Destination 3 is more or less the same as its predecessors. It is an expanded montage of elaborately staged and immaculately bloody deaths strung together by a simple and undemanding story line. Frankly speaking, the stars have not much to do other than stand and act scared - or disbelieving. Regardless, most of the actors did well, with leads Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Ryan Merriman and Kris Lemche standing out slightlier than the rest.Similar to its antecedents, Final Destination 3 is about high-schooler Wendy Christensen (portrayed adequately by Mary Elizabeth Winstead) receiving a premonition of the ill-fated rollercoaster ride in which she is on board. She panics and manages to save herself and a bunch of her friends (or more appropriately, entrees in Death's wish list), but soonafter realizes that Death's in the market for tying up loose ends.If you've decided to give this film a try, then come in with an open mind and just expect fun. Leave your brains at the door, and anticipate gallons of strawberry, juice and banana (creatively mixed up to produce a simulation of blood and bone marrows) to come shooting out of the screen.To grade a film like this, you have to evaluate the atristry of its death sequences, review the mock build up of suspense preceding a death sequence and diagnose the level of bone-chilling each death sequence brings to the table. In short, Final Destination 3 is all about the death sequences. And, suffice it to say, the film succeeds in every level while doing so.Look pass the plot holes gargantuan enough for a train to barrel through. Ignore the poor screen-writing abilities of James Wong, chock-full of dialogues to bury, witty one-liners that never succeeds to pass off as witty one-liners and one or two exchanges so tacky and cliched until it makes you want to punch nails into your ears. Pay no attention to the strong lack of sturdy character development, or the lack of any kind of sturdy characters for that matter. Do all this, and you might just have a good time.For what it's worth, James Wong tries, but still, the sub-plots about the 'Pictures which Tell the Future' and 'The Search for the Two Unknown Ride Attendees' does not add anything new to the table, and instead, turns out to be very predictable and foreseeable. Without wanting to reveal too much, I just have this to say: If you want your audience to be surprised by the plot twist, make sure you have a couple of red herrings ready. Introduce characters who have decent amount of screentime to pose as the possible potential victims, but not too much as to steal the limelight from any of the ten main stars.Nevertheless, as aforementioned, Final Destination 3 is a movie whose sole purpose is to entertain and delight twisted, sadistic fans by introducing new and improved ways to kill off characters who merits their deaths. And, for that, it passed.Verdict:Those who just expect a good time will find this immaculately bloody film to be fulfilling, to say the least. Those who expect more will be dismayed. Nevertheless, the film hits the targets its supposed to, and that adds up to a good, enjoyable thriller perfect for movie night."

Lot's of blood and gore and a fast going movie."

      "text": "Not that it has THAT much plausible competition, but the original Final Destination, written and directed by X-Files expatriates Glen Morgan and James Wong, was the best, smartest and most effective teen slaughterfest since Wes Craven's original Nightmare on Elm Street. In it, a high school student envisions a fiery plane disaster which will wipe out his Paris-bound classmates and several teachers; he then successfully talks several of them out of taking the flight. Death, who would've completely gotten away with its plans if it hadn't been for those meddling kids, proves to be the ultimate poor sport, and starts picking off the survivors in various bizarre, baroque and mostly very elaborate methods. Part of the original's success (as well as that of its sequel, which was energetically directed by Snakes on a Plane's David R. Ellis) was that Death, although never seen, was an incredibly vivid personality: an anal-retentive type who insistently redoes its handiwork in the EXACT SAME PATTERN that it originally would've had its plans not been thwarted, and judging from the increasingly elaborate nature of the \"accidents\" it stages, is a dark force whose all-time favorite board game isn't Monopoly, Risk or Clue...but Mouse Trap. Sadly, this third entry is as sloppy, perfunctory and unfunny-jokey as most of the Elm Street follow-ups were, and at least those had the lame excuse of Craven NOT being involved with most of them. However, Morgan and Wong are back for this one, and while their use of a roller coaster ride certainly had potential (aren't ALL horror films by nature roller coaster rides?) this movie's victims--who had realistically and intriguingly varied personalities and reactions in the first two Final Destinations--are, except for the hero and heroine, all either disbelieving twits or total morons. The deaths all follow the same identical pattern (whirrrr--woop, woop, woop--whiz!--whew!--WHAM!!!) and the editing, so precise in the first two entries, is maddeningly slapdash, looking as though several frames have been randomly sliced out of all those Rube Goldberg nail-gun/ barbeque pit mishaps. And let's be honest: as far as Death's selected traveling music goes, The Lettermen don't have a fraction of the cultural, historic or emotional resonance that John Denver brought to the original. As anyone would normally expect from the third film in any horror series, the \"special makeup effects\" budget has noticeably increased (probably surpassing the actors' salaries), but for all the gallons and drums of red stuff added by Morgan and Wong to the proceedings, Final Destination 3 still comes off as almost totally bloodless."

      "text": "James Wong returns to the director's seat for this third entry in the teen-slaughter series. Unfortunately, what fans liked about the first movie hasn't been recaptured here. Final Destination 3 plays like a more mediocre version of the second film. The few clever deaths that it does have lack the original's surprise and the second's entertainment value. But at least there's some gore.Where the movie really stumbles is in it's plotting and characters. The previous films also suffered from a bland and generic group of survivors, but at least we didn't have to listen to them whine as much as new lead Mary Elizabeth Winstead. The film drags it's feet getting to the stuff we want to see (the deaths) by forcing us to watch her get freaked out by nothing at the beginning of the film, and mope around for the rest. Everyone else is just there to add to the body count, although Kris Lemche is pretty entertaining. The plot loses the attempts at complexity and depth noticeable in Final Destination 2 in favor of falling back on formula.One thing I do appreciate about the movie is that it keeps the more playful, self-aware tone of the last movie. It makes things a little easier to tolerate and means that the kills themselves have some imagination going for them, even if they lack the punch of the earlier (and later) entries. I feel more could have been done with this though. It never quite embraces the sense of fun it tries to continue with. Like I said, we watch our lead mope a lot.There are some moments here and there where Final Destination 3 has something going for it. It just never really reaches the heights seen elsewhere in the series (which weren't all that high to being with) and takes too long getting to the good stuff. It can be quite the slog to sit through. A shame as it saw the return of James Wong at the helm. He directed the first Final Destination, which is still to this day the one most consider to be the best of them. None of that was really recaptured here. Nor were any of the good things from the second. The lack of which lead to what is arguably the most disposable entry in the franchise.5.8/10"

The movie had a good cast, and though I'm not a huge horror movie fan, I saw this one because something about it caught my attention. Though some of the deaths would most likely never happen. The one thing I really didn't like about this movie is that they leave a cliffhanger ending... you don't even know if Wendy, her sister, and Kevin are able to get off of the subway with her new friends. But I guess since it was moving, they probably don't, hence the line \"This time death will finish them.\" The whole setup made this movie...different, at least you don't see a crazed lunatic going around causing gross deaths like other horror movies. Of course, I can now imagine some overactive kid(s) getting on board and pretending or hoping to have a premonition of a fatal rollercoaster ride just so they can cause a ruckus and see what really happens.

I mean, the movie does what it's always done best, hit the audience with some of the most gruesome reasons to twinge and the occasional \"ohhhhhhhh shyt!\". But the story is just a letdown and the characters are a little more than puppets for Death to take out one by one. It's just that I enjoyed Final Destination 1 and 2 more, even in-between the deaths. Not to mention that 3 doesn't even try to connect to the first 2. It's a whole seperate story with little references here and there to the first two. Because of that, I just don't see the need for Final Destinaion 3 to have been made. Other than to create the whole trilogy thing that seems to be popular nowadays. Oh yeah, and to make just a little more money out of the series. Pointless."

Perhaps a bit too graphic at times, but I think the movie hits its mark as a well-constructed scary entertainment: just sit back, accept the movies' logic, and watch silly teenagers meet their unfortunate demise."

OK, after the premonition and the freak out scene, franky gets off the ride with his camera. now, the cameras gone, yet the crash begins in the exact same spot where it happened in the premonition. Second of all, only a few of these deaths could have happened. Most of the events leading up to the deaths could almost never had happened. [***SPOILERS***] Example, at the tanning salon, what are the odds of the board falling in the position it did. And at the fair where Ian dies, that metal pole knocks over a cannon ball which then destroys the firework support, at what momentum could a pole that small made a ball that heavy go that far. Its not logical. Overall the deaths were gory, although they could have been more creative. But come on, they are creative but too creative. There are many things that should never had happened.
