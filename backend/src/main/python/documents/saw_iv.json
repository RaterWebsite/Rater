If you'd like to know why you think they're stupid, well i will tell you...These movies are like one big puzzle. Each movie connects the pieces together and the 4th one really did introduce new hidden parts of it. All of the movies are very interesting and all of them twist in a way to keep your attention if your IQ is not that low enough to get it. IF you want to watch just horror and be left with good impressions of SAW then watch the 1st or 2nd one IF you want blood and slaughter, well all of them got it and IF you watched them and understood how entertaining the story is, well let's hope they keep it this way And i certainly don't think the ideas are ran out. Actually it seems like it is one big idea ever since the 1st one."

But I have many problems.This film is overstuffed with characters and plot. Some of it could've been cut out, like Art Blank's and Kramer's connection. Just make Blank a corrupt lawyer who's forced to help Jigsaw or die.I also did not like how Daniel Rigg traveled from trap to trap. In the other films, the test subject was abducted, placed in some secret room, and was limited to that area. In this film, Rigg has to go from location to location, IN PUBLIC! What type of bullsh*t is that?!I also didn't like the Bedroom Trap, as Rigg had to get the specific guy, force him into the trap, and move to his next destination. Why didn't Jigsaw put the guy in the trap?!Then there was Perez getting injured, and then presumed dead in Saw V, and then is revealed to be alive in Saw VI. That was pointless.And then there's characters like Detective Fisk who don't do anything and could be cut out.This film helps add some nice details into the Saw series, but its flaws and stupidity is just frustrating for me. 4/10."

      "text": "Even being a large fan of the saw series, i had reservations going into a fourth installment, for much the same reasons everyone else has. However, I left the cinema a very happy person. Saw 4 is definitely not for everyone though. You may not NEED to have seen the others for it to make sense, but you do to be able to appreciate what does take place. I'll leave this free of spoilers, but part of the beauty of saw 4 is it brings so many characters back and gives them resolution, resolutions that simply wouldn't mean much if you hadn't watched their horrific sagas begin from the start. Others will also complain that this film deviates from the \"saw\" franchise; well, really making ANY sequels to saw 1 was deviating from the point of the movie. And if thats you're feelings, then of course you're not going to enjoy this. However, those that come into this with an open mind, and happy to accept the saw franchise evolves with every installment and is constantly changing ( imo) in a positive way, are likely to walk away happy. The traps are back, but more subdued compared to saw 3 ( which i believe was the right move), the twists are back in spectacular fashion, to the point where even if you figure out 1 or 2, there's going to be one or two more to catch you out, and a new killer is revealed....or is there? Due to the nature of the twists, saw 4 leaves the viewer with many new questions to ask, but thankfully these questions are enough to warrant a sequel in my opinion, so hopefully saw V will be the success this has already become! Overall, i give this a 9. I take away one point for the fact many involved in the movie are pretending its a movie where you don't need to have seen the sequels - its not. I'm not saying people won't understand everything (although a second viewing is advised), but the biggest thing is the saw series for me is the character development and the way the viewers become invested in such flawed people; because we can relate. You can't invest in many of these characters, and therefore the events if you haven't seen the rest. However, everything else was spot on, and as a whole movie, i think it may actually be the most compelling of them all."

      "text": "It should have ended after Saw 2. Saw 1 was a creative and interesting movie with a cool twist and Saw 2 upped the ante and the stakes and both movies were about a group of people put in desperate situations who then had to work together to get out of them. Saw 3 was where they clearly began running out of ideas and sure enough, the writer left the series after this installment and Saw 4 brings on a new team of writers. There's a lot to like here; the death traps in this installment are top notch; easily the best in the series and in the genre as well, and a huge step back in the right direction after the comically over-the-top ones featured in Saw 3. Darren Lynn Bousman (director of this installment and Saw 2 and 3,) does a great job of filming this and creating a great atmosphere, and the editing's quick and stylish. We also get some great scenes showing Jigsaw's development and how he became what he was. This is also easily the creepiest installment in the series since the 1st one, bringing back some horror into the series with a few moments that sent chills up my spine. The series's trademark \"plot twist\" is here as well, although it's unfortunately more confusing than surprising. The problem is that the movie is extremely difficult to follow. I have a great memory for movies, so I can remember the events of the first 3 movies very well; that said, I was lost at times here and was downright confused near the end, where I completely lost track of the characters. I strongly recommend you re-watch the 2nd and 3rd movies before seeing this one or you're going to be entirely lost. (And you still will at times feel lost anyway.) When they're not confusing you by flashbacks, flashbacks-within-flashbacks, or a needlessly large cast of characters, the movie pretty much plays out exactly like Saw 3, with 1 character going from 1 victim to another and being put in a series of tests. It's not a bad movie, but it's one that feels at times too similar to the 3rd one in plot and structure. At other times it shows us some cool ideas with different characters and locations, as well as some great death traps...Unfortunately, it too often completely confuses us by cutting to other characters before the many issues and characters that are brought up are resolved. Saw 5's going to be starting production with these same writers and a new director very soon, and I don't know if I'll end up being excited for it; Saw 2 was great but since then they've had to strain to keep this series going by constantly manipulating a huge amount of backstory and cast of characters to the point where only die-hard fans who have watched the past movies hundreds of times will have any hope whatsoever of following these new releases."

You know it's a problem when someone gives a review, saying you HAVE to see all the other Saws before this one, because thats absolutely right. You won't really know the purpose of anyone, or what they are all doing, or any intentions of the random characters they just toss into this movie like wildfire. This is no easy transition into the series, its not like Bourne Ultimatum, where it flows well enough to be its own movie, instead of completely depending on the movies before it. Because ultimately, thats what this movie is. It strings together the exact same formula that the third one was,and brings along the same problems. The contraptions the poor victims find themselves wrapped in are no longer intelligent, no longer plot-worthy, they are simply set for gore and they deliver. But thats the only thing that delivers. Gore, gore, gore. No wit, no intelligence, gore. The story is loosely tied as we go back and forth and back and forth to the past, present, interrogation rooms, an abandoned warehouse building, with some absolutely TERRIBLE video editing. And, well, for the acting, how reaching can a horror movie be when they have to hire Gilmore Girls' Patterson to take a main position? Saw was better when Jigsaw was alive, and when it centered itself around the characters. But in Saw IV, the characters are a just a vehicle to the gore, and the \"twists\" are just there to simply follow its formula. You won't be impressed, or at least, you shouldn't be."

When you take the mystery part out you are left with a bunch of meaningless torture. The \"lesson\" taught and the \"conclusion\" are evident from the first 10 minutes.
