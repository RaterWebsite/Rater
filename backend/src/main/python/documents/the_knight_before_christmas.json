      "text": "A soulless, empty assault on any and all other cinematic works trying (even a little) to do something honest with the filmic medium, \"The Knight Before Christmas\" is exactly what it sounds like it is -- a nearly unwatchable slog through every woeful beat and cliche you've ever seen in any movie like this ever, with a razor thin concept that most likely came about after this borderline morally reprehensible title did first, and a thematic backbone so shriveled and meager, it'd make even the most loyal of Hallmark junkies cry foul. Easily one of the year's worst."

      "rating": "6",
      "text": "Arguably one of the better Christmas movies released this year and it's somewhat original - at least I never heard of such a story. However, the plot lacks consistency which could be overlooked. One thing though: Despite being a Christmas movie, it lacks the cheer and joyfulness aka what make Christmas, Christmas."
