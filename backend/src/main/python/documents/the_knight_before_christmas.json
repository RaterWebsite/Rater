Easily one of the year's worst."}, {"rating": "4", "text": "Vanessa Hudgens is a talented lead and if you're into Christmas movies and rom-coms, this film could probably scratch your itch.

However, the plot lacks consistency which could be overlooked. One thing though: Despite being a Christmas movie, it lacks the cheer and joyfulness aka what make Christmas, Christmas."}], "recommendations": ["the_jungle_book_2", "the_grinch", "scoob", "poltergeist", "ghostbusters_ii", "smurfs_the_lost_village", "home_on_the_range", "secret_society_of_second_born_royals", "the_omen", "a_christmas_carol", "the_thing", "superman_ii", "treasure_planet", "101_dalmatians", "the_avengers", "minions_the_rise_of_gru", "teen_titans_go_to_the_movies", "the_star", "dumbo", "john_carter", "how_the_grinch_stole_christmas", "ghostbusters_afterlife", "speed_racer", "monsters_university", "percy_jackson_sea_of_monsters"]}
